Dhritarashtra said:
Assembled on the field of Dharma, O
Sanjaya, on the field of the Kurus,
eager to fight, what did my people
and the Pandavas do?
Sanjaya said:
Then Duryodhana the prince, seeing
the army of the Pandavas drawn up
in battle array, approached his
master and spoke these words:
Behold, O Master, this great army of
the sons of Pandu, arrayed by your
wise pupil, the son of Drupada.
Here are men of valour, mighty
archers, the equals of Bhima and
Arjuna - in battle Yuyudhana, Virata
and Drupada, the maharathi.
Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana and the
valiant king of Kashi, aIso Purujit,
Kuntibhoja and Shaibya, chief
among men.
Yudhamanyu, the brave; the valiant
Uttamauja; also the son of Subhadra
and the sons of Draupadi - all of
them maharathis.
Know well, O noblest of the twiceborn, those who are pre-eminent
among us. I speak to you of the
leaders of my army that you may
know them.
Thyself and Bhishma and Karna and
Kripa, victor in battle; Ashvatthama
and Vikarna and also the son of
Somadatta.
And many other heroes there are,
armed with various weapons, all
skilled in warfare, who have risked
their lives for me.
Unlimited is that army of ours
commanded by Bhishma, whereas
this their army commanded by
Bhima is limited.
Therefore, stationed
in your
respective positions on all fronts,
support Bhishma alone, all of you!

The aged Kuru, the glorious
grandsire (Bhishma), gave a loud
roar like a lion and blew his conch,
gladdening
the
heart
of
Duryodhana.
Then quite suddenly conches, horns,
kettledrums, tabors and drums
blared forth, and the sound was
tumultuous.
Then, seated in a great chariot
yoked to white horses, Madhava
(Lord Krishna) and the son of
Pandu (Arjuna) also blew their
gIorious conches.
Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna) blew
Panchajanya, Dhananjaya (Arjuna)
blew Devadatta, Bhima of powerful
deeds blew his great conch
Paundra.
Prince Yudhishthira, the son of
Kunti, blew his conch Anantavijaya;
Nakula and
Sahadeva
blew
Sughosha and Manipushpaka.
The King of Kashi, the great archer,
and Shikhandi, the maharathi,
Dhrishtadyumna and Virata and
Satyaki, the unsubdued.
Drupada, as well as the sons of
Draupadi, and the mighty-armed son
of Subhadra, O Lord of earth, all
blew their different conches.
That
tumultuous
uproar,
reverberating through earth and
sky, rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra's
men.
Then, seeing
the
sons
of
Dhritarashtra drawn up in battle
order, as missiles where about to fly,
the son of Pandu (Arjuna), whose
banner bore the image of Hanuman,
took up his bow.
Then, O Lord of earth, he spoke
these words to Hrishikesha (Lord
Krishna): Draw up my chariot
between the two armies, O Achyuta.
So that I may observe those who
stand here eager for battle and
know with whom I should fight in
this toil of war.

Let me look on those who are
assembled here ready to fight, eager
to accomplish in battle what is dear
to the evil-minded son
of
Dhritarashtra.
Sanjaya said:
O Bharata, thus invoked by
Gudakesha (Arjuna), Hrishikesha
(Lord Krishna), having drawn up
the magnificent chariot between the
two armies,
Before Bhishma and Drona and all
the rulers of the earth, said: Partha
(Arjuna)! behold these Kurus
gathered together.
The son of Pritha (Arjuna) saw there
before him uncles and grandfathers,
teachers, maternal uncles, brothers,
sons and grandsons and many
friends as well.
Fathers-in-law and well-wishers also
in both the armies. Then that son of
Kunti (Arjuna), seeing all these
kinsmen thus present,
Possessed by extreme compassion,
spoke this in grief: Seeing these my
kinsmen, O Krishna, gathered, eager
to fight,
My limbs fail and my mouth is
parched, my body quivers and my
hair stands on end.
Gandiva (the bow) slips from my
hand and even my skin burns all
over; I am unable to stand and my
mind seems to whirl.
And I see adverse omens, O
Keshava (Lord Krishna), nor can I
see good from killing my kinsmen in
battle.
I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor a
kingdom, nor pleasures. Of what
avail will a kingdom be to us, or
enjoyments, or even life, O
Govinda?
Those for whose sake we desire a
kingdom, enjoyments and comforts
are here on the battlefield, having
resigned their lives and riches.

Teachers, uncles, sons and likewise
grandfathers,
maternal
uncles,
fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothersin-law and other kinsmen.
O Madhusudana (Lord Krishna),
these I do not wish to kill - though
killed myself - even for the sake of
sovereignty of the three worlds,
how much less for this world.
What happiness could come to us
from slaying
the
sons
of
Dhritarashtra, O Janardana (Lord
Krishna)? Only sin could come upon
us through killing these aggressors.
Therefore it would not be right for
us to kill the sons of Dhritarashtra,
our own kinsmen. How should we
be happy after killing our own
people, O Madhava?
Although, their minds clouded by
greed, they see no wrong in
bringing destruction to the family
and no sin in treachery to friends,
How should we not know to turn
away from this sin, we who clearly
see the wrong in bringing
destruction upon the family, O
Janardana ?
The age-old family dharmas are lost
in the destruction of a family. Its
dharma lost, adharma overtakes the
entire family.
When adharma prevails, O Krishna,
the women of the family become
corrupt, and with the corruption of
women, O Varshneya, intermixture
of castes arises.
This intermixture leads only to hell,
both for the family and its
destroyers. Their forefathers fall as
well, when the offerings of the
Pindodaka cease.
Through the wrongs done by the
destroyers of the family in causing
the intermixing of castes, the
immemorial dharmas of caste and
family become extinct.

Men whose family dharmas have
lapsed, so we have heard,O
Janardana
(Lord
Krishna),
necessarily live in hell.
Alas! We are resolved to commit
great sin in that we are prepared to
slay our kinsmen out of greed for
the pleasures of a kingdom.
It were better for me if the sons of
Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand,
should slay me, unresisting and
unarmed in battle.
Sanjaya said:
Having spoken thus at the time of
battle, casting away arrows and
bows, Arjuna sat down on the seat
of
the
chariot,
his
mind
overwhelmed with sorrow.

Sanjaya said:
To him thus overcome by
compassion, full of sorrow, his eyes
distressed and filled with tears,
Madhusudana (Lord Krishna) spoke
these words:
The Blessed Lord said:
Whence has this blemish, alien to
honourable men, causing disgrace
and opposed to heaven, come upon
you, Arjuna, at this untimely hour?
Partha! Yield not to unmanliness. It
is unworthy of you. Shake off this
paltry faintheartedness. Stand up, O
scorcher of enemies!
Arjuna said:
How shall I fight Bhishma and
Drona with arrows on the
battlefield,
O
Madhusudana?
Worthy of reverence are they, O
slayer of enemies!

It is surely better to live even on
alms in this world than to slay these
noble-minded masters; for though
they are desirous of gain, having
killed them I should enjoy only
blood-stained pleasures in this
world.
We do not know which is better for
us: that we should conquer them or
they should conquer us. The sons of
Dhritarashta stand face to face with
us. If we killed them we should not
wish to live.
My nature smitten with the taint of
weakness, confused in mind about
dharma, I pray Thee, tell me
decisively what is good for me. I am
Thy disciple; teach me for I have
taken refuge in Thee.
Indeed I do not see what could
dispel the grief that dries up my
senses, though I should obtain an
unrivalled and prosperous kingdom
on earth and even lordship of the
gods.
Sanjaya said:
Gudakesha, oppressor of the foe,
having spoken thus to Hrishikesha,
said to Govinda (Lord Krishna): 'I
will not fight' and fell silent.
To him, O Bhavata (Dhritarashtra),
sorrowing in the midst of the two
armies, Hrishikesha smilingly spoke
these words:
The Blessed Lord said:
You grieve for those for whom there
should be no grief, yet speak as do
the wise. Wise men grieve neither
for the dead nor for the living.
There never was a time when I was
not, nor you, nor these rulers of men.
Nor will there ever be a time when
all of us shall cease to be.
As the dweller in this body passes
into childhood, youth and age, so
also does he pass into another body.
This does not bewilder the wise.

Contacts (of the senses) with their
objects, O son of Kunti, give rise to
(the experience of) cold and heat,
pleasure and pain. Transient, they
come and go. Bear them patiently, O
Bharata!
That man indeed whom these
(contacts) do not disturb, who is
even-minded in pleasure and pain,
steadfast, he is fit for immortality, O
best of men!
The unreal has no being; the real
never ceases to be. The final truth
about them both has thus been
perceived by the seers of ultimate
Reality.
Know
That to
be
indeed
indestructible by which all this is
pervaded. None can work the
destruction of this immutable Being.
These bodies are known to have an
end; the dweller in the body is
eternal,
imperishable,
infinite.
Therefore, O Bharata, fight!
He who understands him to be the
slayer, and he who takes him to be
the slain, both fail to perceive the
truth. He neither slays nor is slain.
He is never born, nor does he ever
die; nor once having been, does he
cease to be. Unborn, eternaI,
everlasting, ancient, he is not slain
when the body is slain.
One who knows him to be
indestructible, everlasting, unborn,
undying, how can that man, O
Partha, slay or cause anyone to
slay ?
As a man casting off worn-out
garments takes other new ones, so
the dweller in the body casting off
worn-out bodies takes others that
are new.
Weapons cannot cleave him, nor fire
burn him; water cannot wet him, nor
wind dry him away.

yet can he be dried. He is eternal, allpervading, stable, immovable, ever
the same.
He is declared to be unmanifest,
unthinkable,
unchangeable;
therefore knowing him as such you
should not grieve.
Even if you think of him as
constantly
taking
birth
and
constantly dying, even then, O
mighty-armed, you should not
grieve like this.
Certain indeed is death for the born
and certain is birth for the dead;
therefore over the inevitable you
should not grieve.
Creatures are unmanifest in the
beginning, manifest in the middle
state and unmanifest again at the
end, Oh Bharata! What grief is there
in this?
One sees him as a wonder, another
likewise speaks of him as a wonder,
and as a wonder another hears of
him. Yet even on (seeing, speaking
and hearing) some do not
understand him.
He who dwells in the body of
everyone
is
eternaI
and
invulnerable, O Bharata; therefore
you should not grieve for any
creature whatsoever.
Even if you consider your own
dharma you should not waver, for
there is nothing better for a
kshatriya than a battle in accord
with dharma.
Happy are the kshatriyas, O Partha,
who find, unsought, such a battle an open door to heaven.
Now, if you do not engage in this
battle, which is in accord with
dharma, then casting away your
own dharma and good fame, you
will incur sin.

Moveover men will ever tell of your
disgrace, and to a man of honour ill
fame is worse than death.
The great warriors will think you
fled from battle out of fear, and they
who held you in esteem will belittle
you.
Your enemies will speak many ill
words of you and will deride your
strength. What greater pain than
this!
SIain, you will reach heaven;
victorious, you will enjoy the earth.
Therefore, O son of Kunti, stand up,
resolved to fight!
Having gained equanimity in
pleasure and pain, in gain and loss,
in victory and defeat, then come out
to fight. Thus you will not incur sin.
This which has been set before you
is understanding in terms of
Sankhya; hear it now in terms of
Yoga. Your intellect established
through it, O Partha, you will cast
away the binding influence of
action.
In this (Yoga) no effort is lost and
no obstacle exists. Even a little of
this dharma delivers from great fear.
ln this Yoga, O joy of the Kurus, the
resolute intellect is one-pointed, but
many-branched
and
endlessly
diverse are the intellects of the
irresolute.
The
undiscerning
who
are
engrossed in the letter of the Veda,
O Partha, and declare that there is
nothing else, speak flowery words.
Filled with desires, with heaven as
their goal, (their words) proclaim
birth as the reward of action and
prescribe many special rites for the
attainment of enjoyment and power.
The resolute state of intellect does
not arise in the mind of those who
are deeply attached to enjoyment
and power and whose thought is
captivated by those (flowery
words).

The Vedas' concern is with the three
gunas. Be without the three gunas,
O Arjuna, freed from duality, ever
firm in purity, independent of
possessions, possessed of the Self.
To the enlightened brahmin all the
Vedas are of no more use then is a
small well in a pIace flooded with
water on every side.
You have control over action alone,
never over its fruits. Live not for the
fruits of action, nor attach yourself
to inaction.
Established in Yoga, O winner of
wealth, perform actions having
abandoned attachment and having
become balanced in success and
failure, for balance of mind is called
Yoga.
Far away, indeed, from the balanced
intellect is the action devoid of
greatness, O winner of wealth. Take
refuge in the intellect. Pitiful are
those who live for the fruits (of
action).
He whose intellect is united (with
the Self) casts off both good and
evil even here. Therefore, devote
yourself to Yoga. Yoga is skill in
action.
The wise, their intellect truly united
with the Self, having renounced the
fruits born of their actions and being
liberated from the bonds of birth,
arrive at a state devoid of suffering.
When your intellect crosses the mire
of delusion, then will you gain
indifference to what has been heard
and what is yet to be heard.
When your intellect, bewildered by
Vedic texts, shall stand unshaken,
steadfast in the Self, then will you
attain to Yoga.
Arjuna said:
What are the signs of a man whose
intellect is steady, who is absorbed
in the Self, O Keshava? How does
the man of steady intellect speak,
how does he sit, how does he walk?

The Blessed Lord said:
When a man completely casts off all
desires that have gone (deep) into
the mind, O Partha, when he is
satisfied in the Self through the Self
alone, then is he said to be of steady
intellect.
He whose mind is unshaken in the
midst of sorrows, who amongst
pleasures is free from longing, from
whom attachment, fear and anger
have departed, he is said to be a
sage of steady intellect.
He who has no undue fondness
towards anything, who neither
exults nor recoils on gaining what is
good or bad, his intellect is
established.
And when such a man withdraws
his senses from their objects, as a
tortoise draws in its limbs from all
sides, his intellect is established.
The objects of sense turn away from
him who does not feed upon them,
but the taste for them persists. On
seeing the Supreme even this taste
ceases.
The turbulent senses, O son of
Kunti, forcibly carry away the mind
even of a discerning man who
endeavours (to control them).
Having brought them all under
control, let him sit united, looking to
Me as Supreme; for his intellect is
established whose senses are
subdued.
Pondering on objects of the senses,
a man develops attachment for
them; from attachment springs up
desire, and desire gives rise to anger.
From anger arises delusion; from
delusion unsteadiness of memory;
from unsteadiness of memory
destruction of intellect; through the
destruction of the intellect he
perishes.

But he who is self-disciplined, who
moves among the objects of the
senses with the senses freed from
attachment and aversion and under
his own control, he attains to 'grace'.
In 'grace' is born an end to all his
sorrows. Indeed the intellect of the
man of exalted consciousness soon
becomes firmly established.
He who is not established has no
intellect, nor has he any steady
thought. The man without steady
thought has no peace; for one
without peace how can there be
happiness?
When a man's mind is governed by
any of the wandering senses, his
intellect is carried away by it as a
ship by the wind on water.
Therefore he whose senses are all
withdrawn from their objects, O
mighty-armed, his intellect is
established.
That which is night for all beings,
therein the self-controlled is awake.
That wherein beings are awake is
night for the sage who sees.
He whom all desires enter as waters
enter the ever-full and unmoved sea
attains peace, and not he who
cherishes desires.

When a man acts without longing,
having relinquished all desires, free
from the sense of 'I' and 'mine', he
attains to peace.
This is the state of Brahman, O
Partha. Having attained it, a man is
not deluded. Established in that,
even at the last moment, he attains
eternal
freedom
in
divine
consciousness.

dost Thou spur me to this terrible
deed, O Keshava?
With these apparently opposed
statements Thou dost, as it were,
bewilder my intelligence. So, having
made Thy decision, tell me the one
by which I may reach the highest
good.
The Blessed Lord said:
As expounded by Me of old, O
blameless one, there are in this world
two paths: the Yoga of knowledge
for men of contemplation and the
Yoga of action for men of action.
Not by abstaining from action does
a man achieve non-action; nor by
mere renunciation does he attain to
perfection.
No one, indeed, can exist even for
an instant without performing
action; for everyone is helplessly
driven to activity by the gunas born
of Nature.
He who sits, restraining the organs
of action, and dwelling in his mind
on the objects of sense, self-deluded,
he is said to be a hypocrite.
But he who, controlling the senses
by the mind, without attachment
engages the organs of action in the
Yoga of action, he excels, O Arjuna.
Do your allotted duty. Action is
indeed superior to inaction. Even
the survival of your body would not
be possible without action.
Excepting actions performed for
yagya, this world is in bondage to
action. For the sake of yagya
engage in action free from
attachment.
In the beginning, having created
men along with yagya, the Lord of
Creation said: By this yagya shall ye
prosper and this shall bring forth the
fulfilment of desires.
Through yagya you sustain the
gods and those gods will sustain
you. By sustaining one another, you
will attain the highest good.

Satisfied by the yagya, the gods will
certainly bestow the enjoyments
you desire. But he who enjoys their
gifts without offering to them is
merely a thief.
The righteous, who eat the remains
of the yagya, are freed from all sins.
But the unrighteous, who prepare
food for themselves alone, truly,
they eat sin.
From food creatures come into
being; from rain is produced food;
from yagya comes forth rain and
yagya is born of action.
Know action to be born of Brahma
(the Veda). Brahma springs from the
Imperishable. Therefore the allpervading
Brahma
is
ever
established in yagya.
He who in this life does not follow
the wheel thus set revolving, whose
life is sinful, whose contentment lies
in the senses, he lives in vain, O
Partha.
But the man whose delight is in the
Self alone, who is content in the
Self, who rejoices only in the Self,
for him there is no action that he
need do.
Neither has he any profit to gain in
this life from the actions he has done
or from the actions he has not done;
nor is there any living creature on
whom he need rely for any purpose.
Therefore, remaining unattached,
always do the action worthy of
performance. Engaging in action
truly unattached, man attains to the
Supreme.
By action alone, indeed, Janaka and
others gained perfection. Moreover,
even looking to the welfare of the
world, you should perform action.
Whatsoever a great man does, the
very same is aIso done by other
men. Whatever the standard he sets,
the world follows it.

ln the three worlds there is no action
which I need do, O Partha; nor is
there for Me anything worth
achieving unattained; even so I am
engaged in action.
What if I did not continue
unwearyingly in activity, O Partha?
Men in every way follow My
example.
If I did not engage in action, these
worlds would perish and I would be
the cause of confusion and of the
destruction of these people.
As the unwise act out of their
attachment to action, O Bharata, so
should the wise act, but without any
attachment, desiring the welfare of
the world.
Let not the wise man create a
division in the minds of the ignorant,
who are attached to action.
Established in Being, he should
direct them to perform all actions,
duly engaging in them himself.
Actions are in every case performed
by the gunas of Nature. He whose
mind is deluded by the sense of 'I'
holds 'l am the doer'.
But he who knows the truth about
the divisions of the gunas and their
actions, O mighty-armed, knowing
that it is the gunas which act upon
the gunas, remains unattached.
Those deluded by the gunas of
Nature are attached to the actions of
the gunas. Let not him who knows
the whole disturb the ignorant who
know only the part.
Surrendering all actions to Me by
maintaining your consciousness in
the Self, freed from longing and the
sense of 'mine', fight, delivered from
the fever (of delusion).
Those men who are possessed of
faith, who do not find fault and
always follow this teaching of Mine,
they too are liberated from action.

But those who find fault and do not
follow My teaching: know them to
be deluded about all knowledge,
doomed and senseless.
Creatures follow their own nature.
Even the enlightened man acts
according to his own nature. What
can restraint accomplish?
The attachment and aversion of
each sense are located in the object
of that sense; let no man come under
their sway, for both indeed are
enemies besetting his path.
Because one can perform it, one's
own dharma (though) lesser in merit,
is better than the dharma of another.
Better is death in one's own dharma:
the dharma of another brings
danger.
Arjuna said:
What is it that impels a man to
commit sin, even involuntarily, as if
driven by force, O Varshneya?
The Blessed Lord said:
It is desire, it is anger, born of rajoguna, all-consuming and most evil.
Know this to be the enemy here on
earth.
As fire is covered by smoke, as a
mirror by dust, as an embryo is
covered by the amnion, so is This
covered by that.
Wisdom is veiled by this insatiable
flame of desire which is the constant
enemy of the wise, O son of Kunti.
The senses, the mind and the
intellect are said to be its seat.
Overshadowing wisdom by means
of these, it deludes the dweller in the
body.
Therefore, having first organized the
senses, O best of Bharatas, shake off
this evil, the destroyer of knowledge
and realization.
The senses, they say, are subtle;
more subtle than the senses is mind;
yet finer than mind is intellect; that
which is beyond even the intellect is
he.

Thus, having known him who is
beyond the intellect, having stilled
the self by the Self, O mighty-armed,
slay the enemy in the form of desire,
difficult to subdue.

The Blessed Lord said:
I proclaimed this imperishable Yoga
to Vivaswat, Vivasvat declared it to
Manu and Manu told it to
Ikshvaku.
Thus having received it one from
another, the royal sages knew it.
With the long lapse of time, O
scorcher of enemies, this Yoga has
been lost to the world.
This same age-old Yoga, which is
indeed the supreme secret, I have
today declared to you because you
are my devotee and friend.
Arjuna said:
Later was Thy birth and earlier the
birth of Vivasvat: how am I to
understand this saying that Thou
didst proclaim it in the beginning ?
The Blessed Lord said:
Many births have passed for Me
and for you also, O Arjuna. I know
them all but you know them not, O
scorcher of enemies.
Though I am unborn and of
imperishable nature, though Lord of
all beings, yet remaining in My own
nature I take birth through My own
power of creation.
Whenever dharma is in decay and
adharma flourishes, O Bharata, then
I create Myself.
To protect the righteous and
destroy the wicked, to establish
dharma firmly, I take birth age after
age.
My birth and My activity are divine.
He who knows this in very essence,
on leaving the body is not reborn.
He comes to Me, O Arjuna.

Freed from attachment, fear and
anger, absorbed in Me, taking
refuge in Me, purified by the
austerity of wisdom, many have
come to My Being.
As men approach Me, so do I favour
them; in all ways, O Partha, men
follow My path.
Those who desire fulfilment of
actions here on earth make offerings
to the gods, for success born of
action comes quickly in the world of
men.
The fourfold order was created by
Me according to the division of
gunas and actions. Though I am its
author, know Me to be the nondoer, immutable.
Actions do not involve Me, nor
have I any longing for the fruit of
action. He who truly knows Me
thus is not bound by actions.
Having known this, even the
ancient seekers of liberation
performed action; therefore, do you
perform action as did the ancients in
olden days.
What is action, what inaction? Even
the wise are bewildered here. I shall
expound to you that action,
knowing which you will be freed
from evil.
Action,
indeed,
should
be
understood, wrong action should
also be understood and inaction
should be understood as well.
Unfathomable is the course of
action.
He who in action sees inaction and
in inaction sees action is wise
among men. He is unifed, he has
accomplished all action.
He whose every undertaking is free
from desire and the incentive
thereof, whose action is burnt up in
the fire of knowledge, him the
knowers of Reality call wise.

Having cast off attachment to the
fruit of action, ever contented,
depending on nothing, even though
fully engaged in action he does not
act at all.
Expecting nothing, his heart and
mind
disciplined,
having
relinquished
all
possessions,
performing action by the body
alone, he incurs no sin.
Satisfied with whatever comes
unasked, beyond the pairs of
opposites, free from envy, balanced
in success and failure, even acting
he is not bound.
He who is freed from attachment,
liberated, whose mind is established
in wisdom, who acts for the sake of
yagya, his action is entirely
dissolved.
Brahman is the act of offering.
Brahman the oblation poured by
Brahman into fire that is Brahman.
To Brahman alone must he go who
is fixed in Brahman through action.
Some yogis perform yagya merely
by worshipping the gods, others by
offering the yagya itself into the fire
that is Brahman.
Some offer hearing and other senses
in the fires of control; some offer
sound and other objects of the
senses in the fires of the senses.
Others offer all the activities of the
senses and of the life-breath in the
fire of Yoga, which is self-control
kindled by enlightenment.
Some likewise perform yagya by
means of material possessions, by
austerity and by the practice of
Yoga; while other aspirants of rigid
vows offer as yagya their scriptual
learning and knowledge.
Others again, who are devoted to
breathing exercises, pour the inward
into the outward breath and the
outward into the inward, having
restrained the course of inhalation
and exhalation.

Yet others, restricting their food,
offer breaths into breaths. All these
indeed are knowers of yagya, and
through yagya their sins are cast
away.
Eating the remains of the yagya,
which is nectar, they reach the
eternal Brahman. This world, O best
of Kurus, is not for him who offers
no yagya, much less the world
hereafter.
In this way yagyas of many kinds
are set forth in the words of the
Veda. Know them all as born of
action. Thus knowing you will find
release.
Better than the yagya through
material means is the yagya of
knowledge, O scorcher of enemies.
All action without exception, O
Partha, culminates in knowledge.
Know this: through homage,
repeated inquiry and service, the
men of knowledge who have
experienced Reality will teach you
knowledge.
Knowing this, O son of Pandu, you
will no more fall into such delusion;
for through this you will see all
beings in your Self and also in Me.
Even if you were the most sinful of
all sinners, you would cross over all
evil by the raft of knowledge alone.
As a blazing fire turns fuel to ashes,
so does the fire of knowledge turn
all actions into ashes.
Truly there is in this world nothing
so purifying as knowledge; he who
is perfected in Yoga, of himself in
time finds this within himself.
He gains knowledge who is
possessed of faith, is active of
purpose and has subdued the
senses. Having gained knowledge,
swiftly he comes to the supreme
peace.

But the man who is without

doubting mind there is neither this
world nor another nor any
happiness.
He who has renounced action by
virtue of Yoga, O winner of wealth,
whose doubts are rent asunder by
knowledge, who is possessed of the
Self, him actions do not bind.
Therefore, having cut asunder with
the sword of knowledge this doubt
of yours born of ignorance and
rooted in the heart, resort to Yoga.
Stand up, O Bharata!

Arjuna said:
Thou
praisest,
O
Krishna,
renunciation of action and Yoga (of
action) at the same time. Tell me
decisively which is the better of
these two.
The Blessed Lord said:
Both renunciation and the Yoga of
action lead to the supreme good.
But of the two, the Yoga of action is
superior to the renunciation of
action.
Know him to be ever a man of
renunciation who neither hates nor
desires; free from the pairs of
opposites, he is easily released from
bondage, O mighty-armed.
The ignorant, and not the wise,
speak of the path of knowledge
(Sankhya) and the path of action
(Yoga) as different. He who is
properly established even in one
gains the fruit of both.
The state attained by men on the
path of knowledge is also reached
by those on the path of action. He
who sees Sankhya and Yoga to be
one, verily he sees.

Renunciation is indeed hard to
attain without Yoga, O mightyarmed. The sage who is intent on
Yoga comes to Brahman without
long delay.
Intent on Yoga, pure of spirit, he
who has fully mastered himself and
has conquered the senses, whose
self has become the Self of all
beings, he is not involved even
while he acts.
One who is in Union with the
Divine and who knows the Truth
will maintain 'l do not act at all'. In
seeing, hearing, touching, smelling,
eating, walking, sleeping, breathing,
speaking, letting go, seizing and
even in opening and closing the
eyes, he holds simply that the senses
act among the objects of sense.
He who acts giving over all actions
to the universal Being, abandoning
attachment, is untouched by sin as a
lotus leaf by water.
By means of the body, by the mind,
by the intellect and even by the
senses alone, yogis, abandoning
attachment, perform action for selfpurification.
He who is united with the Divine,
having abandoned the fruit of
action, attains to lasting peace. He
who is not united with the Divine,
who is spurred by desire, being
attached to the fruit of action, is
firmly bound.
Having renounced all action by the
mind, the dweller in the body rests
in happiness, in the city of nine
gates, neither acting nor causing
action to be done.
The Lord creates neither the
authorship of action nor the action
of beings; nor does He create the
link between (the doer), the action
and its fruit Nature carries this out.
The all-pervading Intelligence does
not accept the sin or even the merit
of anyone. Wisdom is veiled by
ignorance. Thereby creatures are
deluded.

But in those in whom that
ignorance is destroyed by wisdom,
wisdom, like the sun, illumines That
which is transcendent.
Their intellect rooted in That, their
being established in That, intent on
That, wholly devoted to That,
cleansed of all impurities by wisdom,
they attain to a state from which
there is no return.
In a brahmin endowed with learning
and humility, in a cow, in an
elephant, in a dog and even in one
who has lost his caste, the
enlightened perceive the Same.
Even here, in this life, the universe is
conquered by those whose mind is
established in equanimity. FIawless,
indeed, and
equally
present
everywhere is Brahman. Therefore
they are established in Brahman.
He who neither greatly rejoices on
obtaining what is dear to him, nor
grieves much on obtaining what is
unpleasant, whose intellect is
steady, who is free from delusion, he
is a knower of Brahman, established
in Brahman.
He whose self is untouched by
externaI contacts knows that
happiness which is in the Self. His
self joined in Union with Brahman,
he enjoys eternal happiness.
All pleasures born of contact are
only sources of sorrow; they have a
beginning and an end, O son of
Kunti. The enlightened man does
not rejoice in them.
He who is able, even here, before
liberation from the body, to resist
the excitement born of desire and
anger, is united with the Divine. He
is a happy man.
He whose happiness is within,
whose contentment is within, whose
sight is all within, that yogi, being
one with Brahman, attains eternal
freedom in divine consciousness.

The seers, whose sins are destroyed,
whose doubts are dispelled, who are
self-controlled and take delight in
doing good to all creatures, attain
eternal
freedom
in
divine
consciousness.
Disciplined men, freed from desire
and anger, who have disciplined
their thoughts and have realized the
Self, find eternal freedom in divine
consciousness everywhere.
Having left external contacts
outside; with the vision within the
eyebrows; having balanced the
ingoing and outgoing breaths that
flow through the nostrils,
The sage, whose senses, mind and
intellect are controlled, whose aim is
liberation, from whom desire, fear
and anger have departed, is indeed
for ever free.
Having known Me as the enjoyer of
yagyas and austerities, as the great
Lord of all the world, as the friend of
all beings, he attains to peace.

The Blessed Lord said:
He who performs action that ought
to be done, without depending on
the fruit of action, he is a sanyasi
and he is a yogi; not he who is
without fire and without activity.
That which they call Sanyasa, know
it to be Yoga, O son of Pandu, for no
one becomes a yogi who has not
relinquished the incentive of desire.
Action is said to be the means for
the man of thought wishing to
ascend to Yoga; for the man who
has ascended to Yoga, and for him
alone, calmness is said to be the
means.
Only when a man does not cling to
the objects of the senses or to
actions, only when he has
relinquished all incentive of desire, is
he said to have ascended to Yoga.

Let a man raise his self by his Self,
let him not debase his Self; he alone,
indeed, is his own friend, he alone
his own enemy.
He who has conquered his self by
his Self alone is himself his own
friend; but the Self of him who has
not conquered his self will behave
with enmity like a foe.
For him who has conquered his self,
who is deep in peace, the
transcendent Self is steadfast in heat
and cold, in pleasure and pain, in
honour and disgrace.
That yogi is said to be united who is
contented in knowledge and
experience, unshakeable, master of
the senses, who is balanced in
experiencing earth, stone or gold.
Distinguished is he who is of even
intellect among well-wishers, friends
and foes, among the indifferent and
the impartial, among hatefuI persons
and among kinsmen, among the
saints as well as the sinful.
Let the yogi always collect himself
remaining in seclusion, alone, his
mind and body subdued, expecting
nothing, without possessions,
In a clean place, having set his seat
firm, neither very high nor very low,
having placed sacred grass, deerskin
and cloth one upon the other.
Seated there on the seat, having
made the mind one-pointed, with
the activity of the senses and
thought subdued, let him practise
Yoga for self-purification.
Steady, keeping body, head and
neck upright and still, having
directed his gaze to the front of his
nose, without looking in any
direction,
With his being deep in peace, freed
from fear, settled in the vow of
chastity, with mind subdued and
thought given over to Me, let him sit
united realizing Me as the
Transcendent.

Ever thus collecting himself, the
yogi of disciplined mind attains to
peace, the supreme liberation that
abides in Me.
Yoga, indeed, is not for him who
eats too much nor for him who does
not eat at all, O Arjuna; it is not for
him who is too much given to sleep
nor yet for him who keeps awake.
For him who is moderate in food
and recreation, moderate of effort in
actions, moderate in sleep and
waking, for him is the Yoga which
destroys sorrow.
When his mind, completely settled, is
established in the Self alone, when
he is free from craving for any
pleasure, then is he said to be
united.
A lamp which does not flicker in a
windless pIace, to such is compared
the yogi of subdued thought
practising Union with the Self.
That (state) in which thought,
settled through the practice of
Yoga, retires, in which, seeing the
Self by the Self alone, he finds
contentment in the Self;
Knowing that which is infinite joy
and which, lying beyond the senses,
is gained by the intellect, and
wherein established, truly he does
not waver;
Having gained which he counts no
other gain as higher, established in
which he is not moved even by
great sorrow;
Let that disunion of the union with
sorrow be known by the name of
Yoga (Union). This Yoga should be
practised with firm resolve and heart
undismayed.
Abandoning without reserve all
desires from which the incentive (to
action) is born, controlling the
village of the senses on every side
by the mind alone.

Let him gradually retire through the
intellect possessed of patience;
having established the mind in the
Self, let him not think at all.
Whatever makes the fickle and
unsteady mind wander forth, from
that withdrawn, let him bring it
under the sway of the Self alone.
For supreme happiness comes to the
yogi whose mind is deep in peace, in
whom the spur to activity is stilled,
who is without blemish and has
become one with Brahman.
Ever thus collecting himself, the
yogi, freed from blemish, with ease
attains contact with Brahman,
which is infinite joy.
He whose self is established in
Yoga, whose vision everywhere is
even, sees the Self in all beings, and
all beings in the Self.
He who sees Me everywhere, and
sees everything in Me, I am not lost
to him nor is he lost to Me.
Established in Unity, he who
worships Me abiding in all beings, in
whatever way he lives, that yogi
lives in Me.
He who sees everything with an
even vision by comparison with the
Self, be it pleasure or pain, he is
deemed the highest yogi, O Arjuna.
Arjuna said:
This Yoga described by Thee as
characterized by evenness, O
Madhusudana, I do not see its
steady endurance, because of
wavering.
For wavering is the mind, O Krishna,
turbulent, powerful and unyielding;
I consider it as difficult to control as
the wind.
The Blessed Lord said:
No doubt, O mighty-armed, the mind
is hard to control, it is wavering, but
by practice and non-attachment it is
held, O son of Kunti.

For an undisciplined man, Yoga is
hard to achieve, so I consider; but it
can be gained through proper
means by the man of endeavour
who is disciplined.
Arjuna said:
What goal does he reach, O Krishna,
who is not perfected in Yoga, being
endowed with faith, yet lacking
effort, his mind strayed from Yoga?
Deluded on the path to Brahman, O
mighty-armed, without foothold and
fallen from both, does he not perish
like a broken cloud?
Thou art able to dispel this doubt of
mine completely, O Krishna. Truly,
there is none save Thee who can
dispel this doubt.
The Blessed Lord said:
O Partha, there is no destruction for
him in this world or hereafter; for
none who acts uprightly, My son,
goes the way of misfortune.
Having attained the worlds of the
righteous and dwelt there for
countless years, he that strayed from
Yoga is born in the house of the
pure and illustrious.
Or he is born in an actual family of
yogis endowed with wisdom,
though such a birth as this on earth
is more difficult to attain.
There he regains that level of Union
reached by the intellect in his former
body, and by virtue of this, O joy of
the Kurus, he strives yet more for
perfection.
By that former practice itself he is
irresistibly borne on. Even the
aspirant to Yoga passes beyond the
Veda.
But the yogi who strives with zeal,
purified of all sin and perfected
through many births, thereupon
reaches the transcendent goal.
A yogi is superior to the austere; he
is deemed superior even to men of
knowledge. A yogi is superior to
men of action. Therefore be a yogi,
O Arjuna.
