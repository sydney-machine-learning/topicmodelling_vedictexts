Publisherís Note
As a book of scripture, the Bhagavadg∂tå has
assumed a position of universal interest. Its
teachings have gained appreciation not only in
India, but far beyond its borders, Our G∂tå-Library
alone comprises about 1400 editions of the
Bhagavadg∂tå published in 34 different languages
including 8 foreign languages. This is our humble
attempt for bringing out this English edition of
the G∂tå in pocket-size and in a popular form. We
trust it will find favour with the English-reading
public. The English translation of this edition
has been based on the Hindi rendering of the G∂tå
made by Syt. Jayadayal Goyandka appearing in
the G∂tå-Tattva Number of the Hindi monthly
ëKalyaní, published by the Gita Press. In preparing
the present English translation, the translators
have made use, every now and then, of other
English translations of the G∂tå, and we express
our grateful acknowledgement for the same.
In order to add to the utility of this small volume
an introduction by Syt. Jayadayal Goyandka and
a synopsis of the G∂tå have been prefixed to the
translation and an article by the same author
bearing on the G∂tå has been appended thereto.

The Greatness of The G∂tå
Truly speaking, none has power to describe in
words the glory of the G∂tå, for it is a book
containing the highest esoteric doctrines. It is the
essence of the Vedas; its language is so sweet and
simple that man can easily understand it after a
little practice; but the thoughts are so deep that
none can arrive at their end even after constant
study throughout a lifetime. Everyday they exhibit
new facets of Truth, therefore they remain ever
fresh and new. When scrutinized with a
concentrated mind, possessed of faith and
reverence, every verse of the G∂tå will clearly
appear as full of the deepest mystery. The manner
in which the G∂tå describes the virtues, glory and
secrets of God, is hardly found in any other
scripture; for in other books, the teachings are
generally mixed up, more or less, with worldly
subjects; but the G∂tå uttered by the Lord is such
an incomparable book that not a word will be
found in it, which is devoid of some spiritual
import. That is why ›r∂ Vedavyåsa, after describing
the G∂tå in the Mahåbhårata, said in the end:ó

ªËÃÊ ‚ÈªËÃÊ ∑§Ã¸√ÿÊ Á∑§◊ãÿÒ— ‡ÊÊSòÊÁﬂSÃ⁄ÒU—–
ÿÊ Sﬂÿ¢ ¬kŸÊ÷Sÿ ◊Èπ¬kÊÁmÁŸ—‚ÎÃÊH
The G∂tå should be carefully studied, i.e., after
reading the text, its meaning and idea should be
gathered and held in the mind. It emanated from

(6)

the lotus-like lips of Bhagavån Vi¶ƒu Himself,
from whose navel sprung the lotus. What is the
use of studying the other elaborate scriptures?
Moreover, the Lord Himself also described its
glory at the end of the G∂tå (Vide Chapter XVIII
verses 68 to 71).
All men, irrespective of Varƒa and Å‹rama,
possess the right to study the G∂tå; the only
qualifications needed are faith and reverence, for
it is Godís injunction to propagate the G∂tå only
among His devotees, and He further said that
women, Vai‹yas, ›µudras and even men born of
sinful wombs can attain the supreme state of
salvation, if they cultivate devotion to Him. And
through worship of Him by the performance of
their own nature-born duties, men can attain
perfection (Chapter XVIII verse 46). Reflection
on these verses make it clear that all men have
equal right to God-realization.
But owing to lack of understanding of the truth
behind this subject, many persons who have only
heard the name of the G∂tå, make this assertion
that the book is intended only for monks and
ascetics, and they refrain from placing the book
for study before their children out of fear lest
through knowledge of the G∂tå the latter
renounce their hearths and homes and turn ascetics
themselves. But they should consider the fact that
Arjuna, who had, due to infatuation, prepared
himself to turn away from the duty of a K¶atriya

(7)

and live on alms, being influenced by the most
secret and mysterious teachings of the G∂tå, lived
the life of a householder all his life and performed
his duties; how can that very G∂tå produce this
diametrically opposite result?
Therefore, men who desire their own welfare
should give up this delusion and with utmost faith
and reverence induce their children to study the
G∂tå understanding the meaning and the underlying
idea of every verse, and while studying and
reflecting on it themselves, should, according to
the injunction of the Lord, earnestly take to
spiritual practice. For obtaining this most valuable
human body, it is improper to waste even a single
moment of oneís time in indulging in transient
enjoyments, the roots of sorrow.

Principal Teachings of the G∂tå
For His own realization, God has laid down in
the G∂tå two principal waysó(1) Så∆khyayoga,
and (2) Karmayoga. Of theseó
(1) All objects being unreal like the water in
a mirage, or the creation of a dream, Guƒas, which
are the products of Måyå, move in the Guƒas,
understanding this, the sense of doership should
be lost with regard to all activities of the mind,
senses and the body (Chapter V verses 8-9), and
being established ever in identity with allpervading God, the embodiment of Truth,
Knowledge and Bliss, consciousness should be

(8)

lost of the existence of any other being but God.
This is the practice of Så∆khyayoga.
(2) Regarding everything as belonging to God,
maintaining equanimity in success or failure, renouncing
attachment and the desire for fruit, all works should
be done according to Godís behests and only for
the sake of God (Chapter II verse 48; Chapter V
verse 10); and, with utmost faith and reverence,
surrendering oneself to God through mind, speech
and body, constant meditation on Godís Form with
remembrance of His names, virtues and glory,
should be practised (Chapter VI verse 47). This is
the practice of Yoga by disinterested action.
The result of both these practices being the
same, they are regarded as one in reality (Chapter
V verses 4-5). But during the period of practice,
they being different according to the qualifications
of the Sådhaka, the two paths have been separately
described (Chapter III verse 3). Therefore, the
same man cannot tread both the paths at one and
the same time, even as though there may be two
roads to the Ganges, a person cannot proceed by
both the paths at the same time. Out of these,
Karmayoga cannot be practised in the stage of
Sannyåsa, for in that stage renunciation of Karma
in every form has been advised. The practice
of Så∆khyayoga, however, is possible in every
Å‹rama, or stage of life.
If it is argued that the Lord has described
Så∆khyayoga as synonymous with Sannyåsa,

(9)

therefore, Sannyås∂s or monks alone are entitled to
practise it, and not householders, the argument is
untenable, because in the course of His description
of Så∆khyayoga in Chapter II verses 11 to 30, the
Lord, here and there, showed to Arjuna that he
was qualified to fight, even according to that
standard. If householders were ever disqualified
for Så∆khyayoga, how could these statements of
the Lord be reconciled? True, there is this special
saving clause that the Sådhaka qualified for the
path of Så∆khya should be devoid of identification
with the body; for so long as there is identification
of the ego with the body, the practice of
Så∆khyayoga cannot be properly understood. That
is why the Lord described the practice of
Så∆khyayoga as difficult (Chapter V verse 6) and
disinterested Karmayoga, being easier of practice,
the Lord exhorted Arjuna, every now and then, to
practise it, together with constant meditation on him.

Living even the life of a householder, man can
realize God through the practice of renunciation.
Indeed, ërenunciationí is the principal means for
attaining God. Therefore, dividing them into seven
classes, the marks of renunciation are being shortly
written below.

(1) Total Renunciation of Prohibited Acts
This is non-performance, in anyway whatsoever,
through mind, speech and the body, low acts
prohibited by the scriptures, such as, theft, adultery,
falsehood, deception, fraud, oppression, violence,
taking of interdicted food and wrong-doing, etc.

(2) Renunciation of Acts performed
for the Satisfaction of Worldly Desires
This is non-performance of sacrifices, charities,
austerities, worship and other desire-born actions,

206

with a selfish motive,* for gaining objects of
enjoyment, e.g., wife, progeny, and wealth, etc.,
or with the object of curing diseases and
terminating other forms of suffering. This is the
second type of renunciation.

(3) Total Renunciation of Worldly Thirst
Honour, fame, social prestige, wife, progeny,
wealth and whatever other transient objects are
automatically gained by the force of Prårabdha
(Karma, which has begun to bear fruit), the desire
for their increase should be regarded as an obstacle
in God-realization, and renounced. This is the
third type of renunciation.

(4) Renunciation of the Habit of
Extracting Service from Others
with a Selfish Motive
Asking for money, or demanding service from
* If under the pressure of circumstance, one is
compelled to do an act sanctioned by tradition and the
scriptures, which is by nature rooted in desire, but nonperformance of which causes pain to anybody or adversely
affects the traditional ways of Action and worship,
performance of it disinterestedly, and only for general
good, is not an act of the satisfaction of desire.

207

another, for personal happiness; and acceptance
of things and service given without oneís asking
for the same; or entertaining any desire in the
mind for getting by any means oneís self-interest
served by another; all these and similar ideas of
getting service from another for the satisfaction
of self-interest should be renounced.* This is the
fourth type of renunciation.

(5) Total Renunciation of Indolence
and Desire for Fruit in the
Performance of all Duties
Whatever duties there are, e.g., cultivation of
devotion to God, worship of the celestials, service
of the parents and other elders, performance of
* If non-acceptance of physical service from another,
or offer of eatables by another, where one is entitled to
accept such service or offer, causes any pain to anyone,
or in anyway hinders the education of the people, in that
case, acceptance of service, abandoning selfishness, and
only for the pleasure of the offerer of service, is not
harmful. For non-acceptance of service done by the wife,
son or servant, or of eatables offered by friends and
relatives, is likely to cause them pain and may prove
harmful, so far as propriety of social conduct is concerned.

208

sacrifices, charities and austerities, maintenance
of the household through the earning of livelihood
by means of works assigned according to the
Varƒå‹rama system, and taking of food and drink,
etc., for the bodyóin the performance of these,
indolence and every form of desire should be
renounced.

(A) Renunciation of Indolence in
the Practice of Devotion to God
Regarding it as the supreme duty of oneís life,
one should hear, reflect on, read and discourse on
the mysterious stories of the virtue, glory and
Love of God, who is extremely compassionate,
friend of all, the best of lovers, the knower of the
heart, and renouncing idleness practise constant
Japa, together with meditation, of His extremely
hallowed Name.

(B) Renunciation of Desire in the
Practice of Devotion to God
Regarding all enjoyments of this world and
the next as transient and perishable and hindrances
in the path of Devotion to God, no prayer should

209

be offered to God for obtaining any object
whatsoever, nor any desire should be entertained
in the mind for the same. Also, prayer should
not be offered to God for the removal of any
trouble even when one is overtaken by it; in
other words, the thought should be cultivated
in the mind that to sacrifice life is preferable
to bringing stain on the purity of Bhakti for
the sake of this false existence. For instance,
Prahlåda, even though intensely persecuted by
his father, never offered any prayer to God for
the removal of his distress.
Curse with harsh expressions, such as, ìLet the
chastizement of God be on Youî, etc., should not
be pronounced even against the persecutor, or one
who does any injury, and no thought of counterinjury should be entertained against him.
Out of pride of attainment in the path of
Devotion, benedictions should not be pronounced
in words, such as, ìMay God restore you to healthî,
ìMay God remove your distressî, ìMay God grant
you a long lifeî, etc.

210

In correspondence also, words of worldly interest
should not be written. In Mårawår∂ society, there
is a general custom of writing such words of worldly
import in the form of prayer to God for obtaining
worldly objects e.g., ìGod is our helper here and
elsewhereî, ìGod will advance our salesî, ìGod
will bring a good monsoonî, ìGod will remove
the ailmentî, etc. Instead of this, auspicious,
disinterested words, such as, ìGod in His state of
Bliss exists everywhereî, ìPerformance of Bhajana
is the essence of everythingî, etc., should be written
and other than these no word of worldly interest
should be written or uttered.

(C) Renunciation of Indolence and
Desire in Connection with the
Worship of Celestials
There is Godís instruction to offer worship to
the celestials, who are worthy of being worshipped,
during the time appointed for such worship,
according to the scriptures as well as tradition.
Regarding the carrying out of Godís instruction
as oneís supreme duty, such worship should be
offered to a celestial with enthusiasm, according
to the prescribed rules, without expression of any

211

desire for the satisfaction of any worldly interest.
With the object of such worship, words
implying worldly interest should not be written
on the cash-book, and other books of account.
For instance, in Mårawår∂ society there is a custom
on the New Year or D∂wål∂ day, after the worship
of Goddess Lak¶m∂, to write many words implying
worldly desire, such as, ìGoddess Lak¶m∂ will bring
profitî, ìThe store will be kept fullî, ìProsperity
and success will be broughtî, ìUnder the protection
of Goddess Kål∂î, ìUnder the protection of Goddess
Ga∆gåî, etc. These should be substituted by
unselfish, auspicious words, such as, ì›r∂
Lak¶m∂nåråyaƒa, in the form of Bliss, is present
everywhereî, or ìGoddess Lak¶m∂ has been
worshipped with great delight and enthusiasm.î
Similarly, while writing the daily cash-book, this
procedure should be followed.

(D) Renunciation of Indolence and
Desire in the Service of Parents
and other Elders
It is manís supreme duty to render daily services,
in all possible ways, to parents, the preceptor, and
other persons who are oneís superior in Varƒa,
Å‹rama, age, qualifications, or in whatever other

212

respect it may be, and daily offer them obeisances.
Cultivating this thought in the mind, and
abandoning all idleness, disinterested, enthusiastic,
and according to Godís behests, services should
be rendered to them.

(E) Renunciation of Indolence and
Desire in the Performance of
Sacrifices, Charities, Austerities
and other Auspicious Deeds
Sacrifices, e. g., the daily obligatory five Great
Sacrifices*, and other occasional sacrifices, should
be performed. Through gifts of food, clothing,
learning, medicine, and wealth, etc., attempt should
be made, according to oneís capacity, to make all
creatures happy, through mind, speech and the
body. Similarly, all forms of bodily suffering should
be undergone for the preservation of Dharma. These
* The five Great Sacrifices are as follows:ó(1) Sacrifice
to gods (performance of Agnihotra, etc.); (2) Sacrifice to
§R¶is (study of the Vedas, performance of Sandhyå and Japa
of Gåyatr∂, etc.); (3) Sacrifice to the Manes (performance
of Tarpaƒa, ›råddha etc.); (4) Sacrifice to Men (entertainment

of Balivai‹vadeva).

duties enjoined by the scriptures should be
performed, with faith and enthusiasm, according
to Godís behests, regarding them as supremely
important, wholly renouncing the desire for all
kinds of enjoyment of this world and the next.

(F) Renunciation of Indolence and Desire
in the Performance of proper Work
for Maintenance of the Family
through earning of Livelihood
It is Godís injunction that the family should
be maintained through service to the world by
performing duties laid down in the scriptures for
the respective Varƒas and Å‹ramas, even as
agriculture, cattle-breeding and trade have been
laid down as the works of livelihood for the
Vai‹ya. Therefore, regarding them as duties,
treating profit and loss as equal, and renouncing
all forms of desire such works should be
enthusiastically performed.*
* Works performed by a person in the above spirit,
being freed from greed, cannot be tainted by evil in anyway,
for in works of livelihood greed is the particular cause
which leads one to the commission of sin. Therefore, just as
Vai‹yas have been advised at length to give up evil practices

214

(G) Renunciation of Indolence and
Desirein Work for Preservation
of the Body
In work for preservation of the body, according
to the scriptures, e.g., pertaining to food, dress,
medicines etc., the desire for enjoyment should
be renounced. They should be performed, according
to the needs of the occasion, only with the object
of God-realization, regarding pleasure and pain,
profit and loss, life and death as equal.
Together with the four types of renunciation
stated above, when according to this fifth type of
renunciation, all evils and all forms of desire are
destroyed, and there remains only the one strong
desire for God-realization, it should be regarded
as the mark of the person, who has attained ripeness
in the first stage of Wisdom.
connected with trade in the footnote of the Hindi
rendering of Chapter XVIII verse 44 of the edition of the
G∂tå published by the Gita Press, Gorakhpur, even so men
should renounce all forms of evil connected with their
respective duties as laid down by the Varƒå‹rama system,
and perform all their duties, for Godís sake, disinterestedly,
regarding them as injunctions of God.

215

(6) Total Renunciation of the Sense
of Meum and Attachment with
regard to all Worldly objects
and Activities
All worldly objects like wealth, house, clothes,
etc., all relations like the wife, child, friends, etc.,
and all forms of enjoyment of this world and the
next like honour, fame, prestige, etc., being transient
and perishable, and regarding them as impermanent,
the sense of meum and attachment with regard to
them should be renounced. Similarly, having
developed pure, exclusive Love for God alone,
the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and
Bliss, all sense of meum and attachment should
be renounced for all work done through the mind,
speech and body, and even for the body itself.
This is the sixth type of renunciation.*
* The renunciation of thirst, as well as the renunciation
of the desire for fruit, with regard to all objects and activities,
have been described above as the third and fifth types of
renunciation, but even after such renunciation the sense
of meum and attachment for them are left as residues; just
as even though Bharata Muni through practices of Bhajana
and meditation and cultivation of Satsa∆ga, had renounced
all thirst and desire for fruit with regard to all objects and

216

Men who reach the stage of this sixth form of
renunciation, developing dispassion for all things
of the world, get exclusive Love for God alone,
the supreme embodiment of Love. Therefore, they
retiring to a solitaty place, like only to hear, and
talk about, the stories of Godís spotless Love, which
reveal the virtues, glory and secrets of God, and
reflect on the same, and practise Bhajana,
meditation and study of the scriptures. They
develop a distaste for wasting even a moment of
their valuable time in the company of men attached
to the world and indulging in laughter, luxury,
carelessness, backbiting, enjoyments, and idle talks.
They perform all their duties reflecting on Godís
Form and Name, only for Godís sake, and without
any worldly attachment.
Thus through renunciation of the sense of meum
and attachment with regard to all objects and
activities, development of pure Love for God alone,
activities, his sense of meum and attachment for the deer
and protection of the deer remained. That is why
renunciation of the sense of meum and attachment for all
objects and activities has been described as the sixth type
of renunciation.

217

the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge, and
Bliss, should be regarded as the mark of one who
has attained ripeness in the second stage of
Wisdom.

(7) Total Renunciation of subtle Desires
and Egotism with regard to the
World, the Body and all Actions
All objects of the world being creations of
Måyå, are wholly transient, and one God alone,
the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge, and
Bliss equally and completely pervades everywhere,
this idea having been firmly established, all subtle
desires with regard to objects of the world, including
the body, and every form of activity have to be
totally renounced. In other words, there should
be no pictures of them in the mind in the form
of impressions. And due to total lack of
identification with the body, there should be no
trace of any sense of doership with regard to all
actions done through the mind, speech and body.
This is the seventh type of renunciation.*
* Even when there is total negation of thirst, of the
desire for fruit, of the sense of meum and attachment with

218

The mental impulses of persons, who attain
Supreme Dispassion1 in the form of this seventh
type of renunciation, get totally withdrawn from
all objects of the world. If at any time any worldly
impulse makes its appearance, the impression does
not get firmly established, for exclusive and close
union of such persons with Våsudeva, the
Paramåtmå the embodiment of Existence,
Knowledge and Bliss, constantly remains intact.
Therefore, in his mind, all defects and
vices having ceased to exist virtues like Ahi≈så2,
regard to all objects of the world and all forms of activity,
there remain subtle desire and feeling of doership as residues.
That is why renunciation of subtle desire and egotism has
been described as the seventh type of renunciation.
1. In the person, who has reached the sixth stage of
renunciation stated above, there may be, now and then,
some slight manifestation of attachment, when there is
any special contact with objects of enjoyment; but in the
person, who has reached the seventh stage of renunciation,
there can be no attachment, even when there is contact
with objects of enjoyment for in his conception, except
God, no other object remains. That is why this renunciation
has been described as Supreme Dispassion.
2. Non-infliction of suffering on any creature through
mind, speech and the body.

219

Truth1, Non-Stealing2, Continence3, Abstaining from
vilification4, Modesty, Unhaughtiness5, Artlessness,
Purity6, Contentment7, Endurance8, Satsa∆ga,
Spirit of Service, Sacrifice, Charity, Austerity9,
Study10, Mind-control, Sense-control, Humility,
1. Statement of facts in sweet words, representing exactly
what is realized by the mind and the senses.
2. Total lack of theft.
3. Lack of eight forms of sexual enjoyment.
4. Not to make any damaging statement against anybody.
5. Want of desire for reception, honour, public address
etc.
6. Both external and internal purity. (Truthful and pure
means of earning gives purity to wealth; food obtained
by that wealth imparts purity to food; proper behaviour
is purity of conduct; purification of the body through use
of water, earth, etc.óall this is called external purity.
Through destruction of modifications like attraction,
repulsion, and deception, etc., when the mind becomes
transparent and pure, it is called internal purity.)
7. What of thirst for worldly things.
8. Bearing contradictory experiences like heat and cold,
pleasure and pain, etc.
9. Sufferings undergone for the practice of oneís own
Dharma.
10. Study of the Vedas and other elevating scriptures
and practice of K∂rtana of Godís Name and glory.

220

Straightness1, Compassion, Faith2, Discrimination3,
Dispassion4, Living in seclusion, Poverty5, Lack
of doubt and distraction, Cessation of Desires,
Personal Magnetism6, Forgiveness7, Patience8,
Absence of malice9, Fearlessness10, Pridelessness,
1. This means straightness of the body and mind,
together with the senses.
2. Belief, as strong as in things directly perceived, in
the Vedas, in the scriptures and in the sayings of saints,
the preceptor and God.
3. Real knowledge about what is true and what is false.
4. Total lack of attachment for anything belonging to
any region up to Brahmaloka.
5. Want of accumulation of wealth with the sense of
meum.
6. It is that power of superior souls under the influence
of which even wicked, worldly minded men generally
abstain from sinful conduct and engage themselves in
virtuous deeds according to their behests.
7. Lack of desire to inflict any form of punishment on
one who does an injury.
8. Not to get upset even in the face of the greatest
difficulty.
9. Not to bear malice even against one who is
maliciously disposed.
10. Total absence of fear.

221

Peace*, Exclusive Devotion to God, etc., naturally
make their appearance.
Thus through the total lack of desire and egotism
in regard to all objects, including the body, constant
maintenance intact of identity with God is the
mark of the person who has attained ripeness in
the third stage of Wisdom.
Some of the virtues mentioned above appear
in the first and second stages, but all the virtues
make their appearance generally in the third stage.
For these are the marks of persons, who have reached
very near God-realization, and are the means of
attainment of direct knowledge of God. That is
why in Chapter XIII of the G∂tå (verses 7 to 11)
Bhagavån ›r∂ Kæ¶ƒa enumerated most of these
virtues as Knowledge and in Chapter XVI (verses
1 to 3) described them as the divine qualities.
Moreover, the scriptural authorities regard these
virtues as the common Dharma of humanity. All
men are entitled to them. Therefore, depending
on God, all should make special effort to develop
* Total absence of desires and cravings and
maintenance of constant cheerfulness in the mind.

222

the above virtues in their mind.

Conclusion
In this article it has been said that God may
be realized through seven types of renunciation.
Among them, it has been stated that, the first five
types of renunciation indicate the first stage of
Wisdom, renunciations up to the sixth type
indicate the marks of the second stage of Wisdom,
and renunciations up to the seventh type indicate
the marks of the third stage of Wisdom. He, who
attains ripeness in the third stage of Wisdom above,
at once realizes God, the embodiment of Existence,
Knowledge and Bliss. Thereafter he loses all
connection with this transient, destructible,
impermanent world. Just as the person awakened
from a dream loses all connection with the dreamworld, even so the person awakened from the dream
of ignorance loses all connection with the
impermanent world, the creation of Måyå. Though
from the point of view of the world, all forms of
activities are observed as taking place through
the body of that person under the force of Prårabdha,
and the world gains a lot by such activities, for

223

being freed from desires, attachment and the sense
of doership, whatever the Mahåtmå does through
his mind, speech and body becomes the standard
of right conduct in the world, and from the ideas
of such a Mahåtmå scriptures are formed, yet that
person, who has realized Våsudeva, the
embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss,
lives wholly beyond Måyå, consisting of the three
Guƒas. Therefore, he during illumination, activity
and sleep, etc., which are the effect of the Guƒas,
does not hate them, nor, when they cease, desires
for them. For, with regard to pleasure and pain,
gain and loss, honour and ignominy, praise and
blame, etc., and with regard to earth, stone and
gold, etc., he attains an attitude of equanimity.
Therefore, that Mahåtmå when obtaining a
desirable object, or in the cessation of what is
undesirable, does not feel delighted, nor does he
feel any grief when obtaining an undesirable object,
or in the loss of what is dear or desirable. If for
any reason, his body is cut by a weapon or he is
faced with any other form of extreme suffering,
that man of wisdom, established exclusively in

224

God, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and
Bliss, does not fall from that state of existence.
For in his mind, the whole world appears as a
mirage, and no other existence appears to him
beyond the existence of one God, the embodiment
of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss. What more should
we say about him; the state of that soul, who has
realized God, the embodiment of Truth,
Knowledge and Bliss, is in reality, known to him
alone. None possesses the power to reveal it
through the mind, intellect and senses. Therefore,
awakening as soon as possible from the sleep of
ignorance, and taking shelter under the care of a
saint, and according to his instructions, one should
earnestly take to the practice of a discipline for
realizing God through the seven types of
renunciation stated above. For this extremely
valuable human life is attained, only through the
grace of God, at the end of many births. Therefore,
the invaluable time allotted to this life should
not be wasted in indulging in the perishable,
transient, impermanent enjoyments of this world.
