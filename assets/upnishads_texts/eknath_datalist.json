        "intro": "\u201cIf all the Upanishads and all the other scriptures happened all of a sudden\nto be reduced to ashes, and if only the first verse in the Ishopanishad were\nleft in the memory of the Hindus, Hinduism would live forever.\u201d\nWith these words Mahatma Gandhi paid tribute to the remarkable\nUpanishad that traditionally stands at the beginning of most Indian\ncollections. It owes this priority to the poetic grandeur and sustained\nprofundity of its language, which in only eighteen verses establish the\nfundamental building blocks of spiritual awareness.\nWhat Gandhi had in mind with his great tribute he made clear in his reply\nto a journalist who wanted the secret of his life in three words: \u201cRenounce\nand enjoy!\u201d (tena tyaktena bhunjitah), from the first verse of the Isha.\nThe fifth-century Greek writer we know as Dionysius the Areopagite\nonce said that as he grew older and wiser his books got shorter and shorter.\nHe would have envied the sage of this Upanishad. In its intensity he does\nnot mince words. The central section, verses 9\u201314, is what scholars call a\n\u201ccrux,\u201d or famously difficult passage. The translation brings out its practical\nsignificance: materialism leads us to lose awareness of our inner life, which\nis bad enough; but to be hypnotized by our own feelings and sensations and\nforget about others and the world around us is worse. By living in\nawareness of both these worlds, we can rise above them toward the one\nReality. With the last four verses we emerge onto that lofty plane, and the\nUpanishad takes on a tone of intense devotion that is rare even in later,\nGod-centered mystical literature.\nEach Upanishad comes with an invocation drawn from a traditional set.\nThe invocation to the Isha is especially striking. Consistent with the\ncondensed meaning of the Upanishad itself, it rings changes on a simple\nhousehold word, \u201cfull\u201d (purnam): in the inexhaustible Reality, the infinite\n\fof \u201cthat\u201d world, the unseen, sends forth \u201cthis\u201d world of infinite variety in\nwhich we live, without ever being diminished. The American poet Anne\nSexton may have been thinking of this haunting invocation when she wrote:\nThen the well spoke to me.\nIt said: Abundance is scooped from abundance\nyet abundance remains.\nThis is a very Gandhian idea. Materialism reinforces a \u201cparadigm of\nscarcity\u201d: there is not enough to go around, so we are doomed to fight one\nanother for ever-diminishing resources. Spiritual economics begins not\nfrom the assumed scarcity of matter but from the verifiable infinitude of\nconsciousness. \u201cThink of this One original source,\u201d Plotinus said, \u201cas a\nspring, self-generating, feeding all of itself to the rivers and yet not used up\nby them, ever at rest.\u201d Or, as Gandhi put it, \u201cThere is enough in the world\nfor everyone\u2019s need; there is not enough for everyone\u2019s greed.\u201d The\nappearance of scarcity overcomes those for whom, as the Upanishad says,\n\u201cthe world without alone is real.\u201d There is no scarcity of love, respect,\nmeaning \u2013 the resources of consciousness. Such is the timeless wisdom of\nthe Upanishads. \u2013M.N.",

    "KATHA": {
        "intro": "If there is one Upanishad that can be called a favorite in all ages, it is the\nKatha. It is not hard to see why. Its theme, broadly, is the same as that of all\nthe Upanishads: the deathless Self, the need for and the way to its\nrealization; but the Katha is more successful than other Upanishads at\ndescribing this, in several ways.\nAs the Upanishads illustrate, the right questions are half the battle in life.\nIn the Katha we have the right question in highly dramatic form; in fact we\nhave a highly imaginative confrontation of the ideal teacher (I.1.22) and the\nideal student (II.1.4), and their identity is surprising: the latter is a teenager,\nand his teacher is death.\nWe must consider why.\nNothing places the question \u201cWho am I?\u201d in such stark relief as the fact\nof death. What dies? What is left? Are we here merely to be torn away from\neveryone, and everyone from us? And what, if anything, can we do about\ndeath \u2013 now, while we are still alive?\nMost social life seems a conspiracy to discourage us from thinking of\nthese questions. But there is a rare type for whom death is present every\nmoment, putting his grim question mark to every aspect of life, and that\nperson cannot rest without some answers. It can happen to anyone: in the\n\u201cfall of a sparrow,\u201d a dead animal on the freeway, news reports of some\nfaraway natural disaster, the passing of an old friend, or a new one; in some\nchance reminder of the violence that is not far from any of us, in all these\nthat unwelcome Presence can make itself briefly but urgently known.\nNachiketa represents that rare type of awakened person in whom this\npresence, once glimpsed, can never go away. \u201cNow that I have seen your\nface,\u201d he says to Death, \u201cwhat can I enjoy?\u201d Yet, rare as he is, he represents\n\fthe capacity latent in all of us to face that grim awareness and use it as a\ndrive to deepening consciousness.\nIn other Upanishads and throughout Indian literature allegory is a\nfavorite device, but rarely is it more dynamic and successful than in the\nKatha. The opening narrative is an extended allegory which keeps spiritual\ndepth and dramatic vividness in high suspense: the story never becomes\nunreal and its archetypal significance never becomes invisible; neither is\nmere vehicle or signifier for the other. Every detail has both immediate and\ntranscendent reality (in some cases making translation unusually\ninadequate). Nachiketa, who has more personality than most Upanishadic\nfigures, asks, as an abstraction could not, \u201cWhat is death going to do with\nme, today?\u201d But at the same time he immediately universalizes his\ncondition, which is in fact the most universal of human destinies: \u201cI shall go\nto death, at the head of many more to follow. . . .\u201d That Nachiketa is\nconsigned to death by his own father cries out for allegorical interpretation,\nand it is not hard to supply. As Julian of Norwich, a fourteenth-century\nEnglish anchoress and mystic, wrote, \u201cWe wot that our parents do but bear\nus into death. A strange thing, that.\u201d Birth is but the beginning of a\ntrajectory to death; for all their love, parents cannot halt it and in a sense\nhave \u201cgiven us to death\u201d merely by giving us birth.\nAs for the student, we can only pause in admiration of this ancient\ncivilization whose hero is a teenager who has not learned the rudimentary\ngrace of civilized existence \u2013 to hold his peace in the presence of hypocrisy.\nNachiketa is an attractive character who cannot go along with sham; but he\nis not an obstreperous rebel: he is more sincere about convention than his\nfather (including the convention of obedience to a father even when the\nlatter has lost his temper) and his first wish is for reconciliation with him.\nAt no time does he lack respect. But that is just the point; he forces the issue\nby taking the demands of religion seriously when the majority have long\nsince allowed external observance to paper it over, making of it a dead letter\nthat no longer communicates anything about personal struggle. But by\npoking holes in society\u2019s shroud of complacency he represents, again, what\nit would take to awaken any and all of us. The text sums it up in the single\ntrait it tells us about the lad. He has shraddha: determined seriousness, a\ndeep, abiding, confident faith.\nIn structure and content, the Katha is more of an organic whole than any\nbut the briefest Upanishads. It begins with a prose narrative of the \u201conce\n\fupon a time\u201d variety, sounding very much like its source story in the\nBrahmanas, but it quickly enters a gripping dramatic situation with the\ncharacters\u2019 speeches in verse.\nThen follows the encounter of Nachiketa with Death, and its dramatic\nreversal when he passes Death\u2019s severe test and changes him from gruff and\noff-putting deity to delighted teacher. Though this interpersonal drama falls\ninto the background during the subsequent teaching, it comes back as it\nwere triumphantly at the end of the Upanishad, along with several key\nwords and the major themes of the question for which Nachiketa had gone\nto the king of death to find some answer.\nThe Katha consistently lays stress on several practical themes of the\nspiritual life: that a spiritual teacher is essential; that in all human\nexperience it is really only the Self, pure consciousness, that is the enjoyer,\nso that when one realizes the Self \u201cthere is nothing else to be known\u201d and\n\u201call the knots that strangle the heart are loosened\u201d; and of course that death\noccurs only to that part of us which was born and launched into separate\nexistence. This Upanishad thus speaks to a longing which could not be\ndeeper or more universal: that some day, somehow, as Donne put it, \u201cDeath\nshall be no more: Death, thou shalt die!\u201d\nThe Katha is also distinctive in explaining with the use of two very\npractical terms that every moment we live, even theoretically while we\nsleep, we face a steep choice between what will move us closer to that day\nand what will only postpone it \u2013 that is, between what is good and what is\nmerely pleasant; in Sanskrit, between shreya and preya. While there are no\ndualities and no compartments in reality, as long as there are dualities and\ncompartments in personality, we have to pay careful attention to this\ndistinction at every moment. But that makes life very much worth living;\nand perhaps in this sense, as Wallace Stevens wrote in \u201cSunday Morning\u201d:\nDeath is the mother of beauty; hence from her,\nAlone, shall come fulfillment to our dreams\nAnd our desires.\n\u2013M.N.",

        "intro": "Brihad-aranyaka means \u201cof the great forest,\u201d and that is an apt name for\nthis Upanishad, which is by far the longest and one of the most revered of\nthese magnificent documents. To read it is like walking through a great\nforest with paths leading off in unpredictable but somehow meaningful\ndirections; we keep coming across gems of wisdom.\nThe opening selection illustrates this, being one of the most poignant and\nilluminating discussions in the wisdom of any tradition. It is the dialogue\nbetween a great sage, Yajnavalkya, and his wife Maitreyi. Yajnavalkya has\njust reached a critical juncture in his life: he is about to leave home in the\npursuit of truth, or Self-realization. Maitreyi shares his yearning for\nimmortality, and so the parting dialogue between them turns into a deep\nsession of \u201cspiritual instruction\u201d \u2013 one of the meanings of the word\nupanishad.\nWhat Yajnavalkya wants to teach is the greatest discovery of the\nUpanishads: the Self, which is identical in all of us, the Life of all that lives.\nWhenever we love, he tells his wife, we are really responding to the Self\nwithin that person. Therefore \u2013 and this is the underlying theme of all\nmysticism \u2013 if we discover this Self in our own consciousness, there will be\nno more parting, no more sorrow ever. Shankara once declared that two\nwords from the Upanishads give us the essence of all their teachings:\n\u201cmeditate on the Self,\u201d that is, become one with \u2013 realize \u2013 this underlying\nReality.\nOften, it is this anguish of parting \u2013 the death of a loved one, the breaking\napart of a deep relationship, even the growing up of our children \u2013 that\npropels us into the search for a reality that will never let us down; so this\nopening passage illustrates, through the experience of Maitreyi, the state of\n\fseriousness, of being shocked into alertness, that makes one ready to absorb\nspiritual insight. The only real source of such insight is almost always, in\nIndian tradition, a living teacher who is equally ready to impart it; that is\nwhy almost all the Upanishads are in the form of dialogues.\nIn the next two sections we again meet Yajnavalkya, now playing the\nimportant role of spiritual adviser to a famous king, Janaka, who himself\nwas destined to achieve illumination. Illustrating the wry humor of the\nUpanishads and the very human way they see even the most august sages at\niii.7 Yajnavalkya perks up on hearing that King Janaka will give a thousand\ncows to the wisest among the gathered pundits and casually tells his\ndisciple, \u201cSon, drive them home.\u201d Then, when the outraged brahmins ask\nhow he dares declare himself the wisest among them, he disarms them by\nsaying, \u201cI bow down to the wisest, but I want those cows!\u201d Challenged by\nGargi, another of those women of spiritual authority who appear in the\nUpanishads, the sage explains how all existence \u2013 everything in the\nphenomenal world \u2013 is \u201cwoven\u201d in the Imperishable. To bring across this\ngreat truth he relies on wonderfully vivid images. The human being moves\nbetween two main states of consciousness as a great fish, master of its\nworld, swims back and forth between the banks of a river; like a tired eagle\nreturning to its nest at last, we find our true home in the eternal Self, the\nsource of all awareness. Or, boldly, \u201cas one in the arms of his beloved is not\naware of what is without or what is within, so one in union with the Self is\nnot aware of what is without or what is within,\u201d for all desires are fulfilled.\nWhen we encounter this daring vision of reality, we want to know what\nto do. If this tremendous vision is to have any ultimate meaning for us,\nthere must be some way we can at least partly realize it ourselves.\nAppropriately, then, this selection ends with a passage that, while lightly\ndisguised as mythology, highlights three potent practices: damyata datta\ndayadhvam, \u201cBe self-controlled, give, be compassionate.\u201d This passage,\nboiled down as it is to three potent syllables, da \u2013 da \u2013 da, caught the\nimagination of T. S. Eliot; more to the point, it has helped countless seekers\ndown the ages to orient their lives to the supreme goal. \u2013M.N.",

        "intro": "In the wisdom of ancient India, the universe came forth from the invisible\nand unchanging Reality like the uttering of a meaningful sound: mystical\nspeech (which is why the Vedas are thought of as existing long before\nhuman beings or anything else). It was not a Big Bang but a big Om; and it\nis with this image that the Upanishad named Chandogya, \u201cthe uprising of\nsacred song,\u201d begins. Just as Western scientists seek the laws of the physical\nuniverse in a kind of echo of that primordial explosion, the sages who\npredated them by so many centuries \u201cheard\u201d Om, the primordial sound, and\ndiscovered deep laws governing all existence.\nThe universe is founded on two principles, they discovered. One is rita,\nlaw, order, or regularity. Without it no scientific discovery would be\npossible; more importantly, no moral discovery would be possible. Human\nexperience would have no meaning, for we would have no way to learn\nfrom our experiences.\nThe second principle is yajna, sacrifice. The universe, they tell us, runs\non renunciation. The most significant human action is the sacrifice of\npersonal gain for the sake of something higher and holier.\nIf rita is the moral law, yajna is the human response to live in accordance\nwith that law, taking nothing from life for oneself but everywhere seeking\nto give of oneself to life. Jesus was essentially describing rita when he said,\n\u201cBy the same measure you mete out to others, by that measure shall it be\nmeted out to you,\u201d and yajna when he said, \u201cLay not up for yourselves\ntreasures upon earth. . . . But seek first the kingdom of God and his\nrighteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.\u201d We can use\nthings, but to be in harmony with the underlying laws of life we should\n\fnever feel that they are really ours: as the Isha Upanishad so simply puts it,\n\u201cEverything belongs to the Lord.\u201d\nThis awareness leads to a profound peace, which the Chandogya conveys\nin one of the Upanishads\u2019 most poignant images: \u201cAs a tethered bird flies\nthis way and that, and comes to rest at last on its own perch, so the mind,\ntired of wandering about . . . settles down in the Self\u201d (VI.8.2). This\nUpanishad charts an inward course back to speech, breath, and vital energy\n(prana), and ultimately to the Self, or Brahman. Prana tends to become the\nfocus of attention whenever it comes up, and that is what happens in the\nsections that follow containing the famous stories of Satyakama (IV.4) and\nShvetaketu (VII). These two spiritual students are a striking contrast, as\nSatyakama breaks social convention: born out of wedlock, he has the\ncourage to admit as much to his teacher, who honors that courage and\naccepts him. This episode is one of the most imaginative frame stories for\nteaching in all the Upanishads (which is saying a lot), as various odd birds\nand animals teach him \u201cone foot of Brahman\u201d at a time until he is\nillumined.\nPrana also provides an explanation for the process we call death, as\nprana, life-energy, is withdrawn by progressive steps \u2013 the same kind of\nsteps by which the universe itself was manifested and will be withdrawn \u2013\ninto its ultimate source (VI.15). This prepares us for the triumphant\ndeclaration of Chapter VIII, the \u201cCity of Brahman,\u201d a moving description of\nBrahmaloka, the \u201cLand of No Change\u201d beyond all death and suffering.\nWhile we actually visit this state without knowing it while in deep sleep\n(VI.8.1 and VIII.3.2), we can possess it in full awareness through the heroic\nspiritual disciplines the Upanishads are always leading us to. We can live in\nthis very world free from sorrow, ill health, perturbation, distress of any\nkind; and then for us death, while it claims the body, will never touch us\nbecause we are identified completely with the Self, which is a \u201cbridge\u201d or\n\u201cbulwark\u201d (VIII.4) none of these can cross. \u2013M.N.",

    "MANDUKYA": {
        "intro": "The Mandukya is the briefest of the major Upanishads. Shankara declared\nthat if one could only study a single Upanishad it should be this one, and we\ncan see why: in its succinctness the Mandukya captures the essentials of\nmystical insight. One of the four Upanishadic mahavakyas, \u201cgreat sayings\u201d\nthat are packed into a brief formulaic utterance, occurs in the second verse:\nayam atma brahma, \u201cthe Self is Brahman.\u201d This is probably why, in a much\nlater text, Rama tells a devotee that \u201cthe Mandukya alone is sufficient for\ndeliverance,\u201d though less advanced seekers will have to read the ten\nprincipal Upanishads, or thirty-two, or all one hundred and eight.\nThe twelve verses of the Mandukya revolve around a fundamental\nproposition underlying the entire Vedantic worldview and mysticism\ngenerally: that one Reality (called Brahman in the Upanishads) has become\nthe infinite variety of shifting things that we experience around us in the\nuniverse or within us as the various states of our own consciousness. The\nlatter field of investigation forms the first of two passes through this basic\nidea that make up this text. In this pass we are walked through the four\nstates of consciousness that we all experience: the waking state, dreaming\nsleep, dreamless sleep, in which the autonomic nervous system rests, and\nfinally an indescribable state of consciousness the text calls simply turiya,\n\u201cthe fourth.\u201d Like many such series in the Upanishads, these stages are\nsteps from the everyday reality to the supreme experience. In this final state\nthe sense of \u201cI\u201d is temporarily suspended. Surprisingly, the Upanishad tells\nus that we enter this state regularly, if we could only be aware of it: every\nnight we are \u201clike someone unknowingly walking back and forth over a\nburied treasure\u201d (Chandogya VIII.3.2). So near and yet so far.\nBut we have already been told, in the opening verse, that the supreme\nreality into which we merge in the \u201cfourth\u201d state is also represented by the\n\fsacred syllable AUM. So the sage takes another pass through the stages of\nbeing where the three \u201cworlds\u201d or orders of reality are seen in the sounds of\nthis sacred syllable \u2013 a, u, and m \u2013 as it is manifested in the phenomenal\nworld.\nIt is very common for an Upanishad to present us with multiple passes\nlike this through levels of reality reminiscent of what in the Middle Ages\nwas called the Great Chain of Being. What is different here is that the\nMandukya hints that there is a way to climb that chain. AUM stands for the\nmantram \u2013 a form of sacred utterance, like the repetition of a name of God,\nused in every major spiritual tradition to still the mind and become aware of\nthe divine Reality to which it refers. All mantrams, according to the\nMandukya, go back to AUM, and then beyond even that primordial energy to\nBrahman, the ultimate goal of spiritual progress.\nSo the Upanishad first gives us an inspiring picture of \u201cthat which is,\u201d\nreassuring us that reality is not limited to the world of changing phenomena,\nand then hints at an everyday, doable way to reascend the orders of being\nand regain our spiritual home in the changeless. Shankara did well to praise\nthe condensed power of this Upanishad. \u2013M.N.",

    "KENA": {
        "intro": "At a conference held in New Orleans some years ago, physicists were\nchallenged to explain why there were no pioneers on the order of Einstein,\nBohr, and Heisenberg any more. One young physicist pointed out that the\ncomparison was a bit unfair. Those bold visionaries had been exploring the\nworld outside, while his generation was faced with the infinitely harder task\nof querying, Who is the investigator? How is the mind, our instrument of\nknowing, supposed to turn around and know itself?\nIn India it seems that this point had been reached and crossed very early.\nFundamental questions about reality are found even as early as the Rig\nVeda:\nWhat was all this before creation?\nWas there water?\nOnly God knows, or perhaps he knows not . . . (X.129)\nBy the time we reach the Upanishads this kind of questioning is no longer\nspeculative but has become a systematic and relentless pursuit of truth, and\nit embraced the realization that to know truth we have to come to grips with\nthe medium of knowing and the identity of the knower.\nThis is the realization that turns mere knowing into realization, objective\nscience into mystical awareness. There is a Sufi story about a seeker who\ncalls on Allah day in and day out for years and finally throws himself down\nand sobs, \u201cHow long have I been calling and you do not answer!\u201d Then he\nhears a voice: \u201cWho do you think has been making you call me?\u201d\nKena, the title and opening word of the present Upanishad, means \u201cby\nwhom?\u201d \u2013 that is, impelled by whom do all the motions of life stir? Or in\n\fShankara\u2019s brilliant paraphrase, \u201cBy whose mere presence does that desire\narise which moves the universe?\u201d\nThe text\u2019s answer is clear. The first thirteen verses declare, \u201cHe is the ear\nof the ear\u201d: that is, that which moves the world is consciousness, which in\nthe human being becomes cognition, among other vital functions. Note that\namong the powers that operate our senses we meet \u201cthat which makes the\nmind think.\u201d Mind was a sense, in the Vedantic worldview, in fact, the chief\nsense. This is a little easier to understand when we take into account that the\nword we translate as \u201csense\u201d is actually indriya, \u201cpower, faculty.\u201d\nThen comes a parable. Among the gods (the faculties of perception) only\nIndra has the staying power to merit instruction from the goddess of\nwisdom, Uma, the divine consort of Shiva. She teaches that the victory of\nthe Vedic gods over their adversaries (the creative triumph of order over\nchaos) has not been theirs but that of the supreme power working through\nthem. This is an allegory of the message which sent the Isha Upanishad so\ndeeply into Gandhi\u2019s consciousness, about acting without attachment to the\nresults. The victory of good over evil is guaranteed \u2013 but not by the doer.\nWe cannot win that victory, but we can make ourselves instruments of it,\nprecisely by not thinking of ourselves as the doers but by \u201cmaking\nourselves zero,\u201d in Gandhi\u2019s phrase. This is an immediate, practical\nconsequence of the realization that we are not really the ultimate doer of\nany of \u201cour\u201d actions, including the act of knowing: \u201cIt is the power of\nBrahman that makes the mind to think . . .Therefore, use this power to\nmeditate on Brahman\u201d (IV.5\u20136).\nWith an assurance that this truth is all the seeker need discover, the Kena\nends. \u2013M.N.",

    "PRASHNA": {
        "intro": "The structure of the Prashna Upanishad is quite simple: six illustrious\nseekers approach the sage Pippalada in turn and ask him a basic question\nabout Reality. This allows the sage to begin with the process of creation, or\nthe emanation of the world\u2019s innumerable forms from the divine, as many\nUpanishads do. Then the questions probe progressively deeper into the\npractical mysteries of human existence.\nIn his first answer Pippalada invokes the law of duality by which the One\nbecomes many through complementary opposites like consciousness and\nmatter, giving rise to the various orders of reality down to the sensible\nworld in which we consciously operate. Pippalada names the primary\npolarity prana and rayi, roughly consciousness and matter, and his answer\nto the second question \u2013 \u201cWhat power quickens life?\u201d \u2013 begins with a\nthought-experiment on the primacy of prana over all vital functions. This\nbecomes a hymn to prana, the distinctive theme of this Upanishad.\nPrana is one of those precise but broad-ranging terms in the lexicon of\nVedanta which we will say more about in the afterword. We can call it a\ntechnical term for the energy which fuels evolution, powers the vital\nprocesses in all forms of life, and ultimately becomes thoughts and desires\nin the mind, where it becomes most readily accessible for us to conserve or\nredirect. Around the concept of prana the Upanishads develop a\ncomprehensive theory of life which accounts for everything from health to\nmorality. Thus the questions and answers can become more penetrating, and\nthe sweep of reality to be explained more ample, as this great concept is\nexplored.\n\fAnswer 3 begins with the striking image (partly also at Brihadaranyaka\nII.1.12 and III.9.14) of the Self casting prana into the world of multiplicity as\nits shadow. Our real self is, of course, closer to energy or consciousness\n(prana) than to a form or name (rayi). Pippalada\u2019s answer goes on to\ncategorize the five pranas known in vital functioning, with their\nmacrocosmic equivalents (e.g., 3.8, 4.8). The Self of the Upanishads is both\ndeeper and less circumscribed from the outside world than the usual\nWestern conception of the self (if indeed we have one: Huston Smith has\npointed out that \u201cthere is no consistent view of human nature in the West\ntoday\u201d).\nAnswer 4, delving deeper into the question of human identity, brings in\nanother set of inner\u2013outer equivalents discussed in the introduction to the\nChandogya Upanishad, that of the sacrifice. Answer 5 brings in the cosmic\nsyllable OM. And 6 closes by underscoring, if we needed further emphasis,\nthat prana is prior to and has given rise to \u201cname and form\u201d (nama-rupa): in\nother words, to all conditioned reality. \u201cName and form,\u201d roughly, is the\nIndian equivalent of the Kantian categories of time and space, as the givens\nwhich make possible but also set limits around what the mind can grasp. \u2013\nM.N.",

    "TAITTIRIYA": {
        "intro": "The Upanishads make a careful distinction between the terms pleasure and\njoy. Pleasure, which mainly comes from sense experience, is transitory and\nactually quite limited. Joy comes from being in harmony with the creative\nforces of the universe, with one's own destiny, and is permanent - one of\nthe main reasons we can tell it apart from pleasure - and has no limits at all.\nThis is an important distinction in mysticism, and in a striking passage, the\nTaittiriya Upanishad builds on this idea and tries to give us some sense of\nthe magnitude of the joy that is our legacy, building up systematically, in\nexpansions of a hundred, a comparison with the limited experience that we\nhave now to the inexpressible joy of unity with the supreme.\nThat alone would be an outstanding contribution, but the Taittiriya has\nother distinctive features. One is the model of the human being as the Self\nencased in five wrappings like a Chinese puzzle, starting from the material\nbody (the first self we are generally aware of) and progressing inward to the\n'sheaths' of vitality (prana), mind, intuition (buddhi), and finally joy.\nAlong with the quantum leaps in joy are similar qualitative steps in\nawareness for those who push deeper through these layers of condensation,\nas it were, that cover our real Self.\nHow is this to be done? Here the text gives one of those practical insights\nthat startle us with their contemporary bearing: 'Respect food . . . Waste not\nfood . . . The earth can yield much more. . . . Refuse not food to those who\nare hungry.' (III.8–10). Passages like these should give final proof that the\nreligion of the Upanishads is not world-denying. The layered models that\nthey develop in so many forms make us feel more respect for the things of\nthis world. Food, for example, is life-energy, or prana, condensed into\nmatter. When we respect that energy on the physical level, we gain easier\npassage to the level beyond. Of course, this is even more true of our fellow\ncreatures; alienation from them blocks spiritual growth. By realizing the\nunity from which each created thing has come and in which it is sustained,\nwe can live rightly in the world of change in order to ascend through it to\nthe eternal.\nSection I.11 is a famous passage in this same spirit, a kind of\n'convocation address' to spiritual students who have finished their course\nof study, the phase of life called brahma-charya; it follows naturally on\nsection 9, here titled 'To the Householder.' The Upanishads are intended\nnot only for renunciates in Himalayan caves or forest solitude; they are also\nvery much for those who wish to carry out the dharmas of social life in the\nworld.\nLike the Kena, this Upanishad ends rather than begins with a narrative.\nThe story of Bhrigu addresses how we can make our own life part of the\nupward drive of spiritual evolution by 'serving the Self' in everything we\ndo. Than that, the Upanishad asserts, there can be no greater joy.",

    "AITAREYA": {
        "intro": "Perhaps the greatest contribution of the Upanishads is to open our eyes to\nwhat it really means to be a human being. The constant concern of the sages\nis to reawaken us to the sacred nature of the environment, of living\ncreatures, of one another, and finally of our own inner reality. This exalted\nvision of the human person has been echoed by the anonymous monk of\nfourteenth-century England who has left us one of the world\u2019s greatest\nmystical documents, the Cloud of Unknowing:\nBeneath you and external to you lies the entire created universe. Yes,\neven the sun, the moon, and the stars. They are fixed above you,\nsplendid in the firmament, yet they cannot be compared to your exalted\ndignity as a human being. . . . There is nothing above you in nature\nexcept God himself.\nHow can this be? How can this miniscule, fragile body whose size in the\nUniverse is beyond ludicrous be, or contain, such importance? Because, the\nUpanishads and all the world\u2019s great mystics insist, we are not that fragile\nbody but that which causes it to move, breathe, and be alive: consciousness.\nIn this Upanishad we have one of the four mahavakyas or \u201cgreat utterances\u201d\nthat later tradition teased out as the sum and substance of their teaching:\nprajnam brahma, \u201cAll reality is consciousness.\u201d And the same\nconsciousness is the life of all: thus we have the explanation for both the\nsanctity and the unity of life.\nThe Aitareya lays out this explanation by telling the story of evolution in\nthe form of a creation myth. To us today it seems very Lamarckian because\nit sees the driving force of evolution as desire; but if we bear in mind that\n\fthe sages understood desire to be precisely that \u2013 a force, rather than simply\ncravings or emotions \u2013 the myth is not so implausible. The titanic energy of\nevolution suggests some kind of drive; when the sages (or the early Greek\nthinkers) called it \u201cdesire,\u201d they were connecting life in the here-and-now to\nthat awesome cosmic process by which the One manifested itself as, and\nstill sustains, the many.\nA great sage of modern India who was most Upanishadic in his exalted\nvision of this process, Sri Ramana Maharshi, replied to the urgent questions\nof a distinguished philosopher in words that always haunt me:\nHappiness is the very nature of the Self; happiness and the Self are not\ndifferent. There is no happiness in any object of the world. We imagine\nthrough our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects. When the\nmind goes out, it experiences misery. In truth, when its desires are\nfulfilled, it returns to its own place and enjoys the happiness that is the\nSelf. \u2013M.N.",

    "FOUR MINOR UPANISHADS": {
        "intro": "A \u201cminor\u201d Upanishad, by definition, is one that has not been commented\nupon or extensively cited by Shankara, not necessarily one that is minor in\nwisdom or expressive power. Shankara\u2019s commentaries elevated the\nprincipal Upanishads into a kind of canon; but it should be noted that the\nlist is not fixed \u2013 various authorities, ancient and modern, have reshaped it \u2013\nand there may in any case have been other commentaries of Shankara\nwhich have not survived. Some of the so-called minor texts convey insights\nof the same magnitude as those singled out by Shankara, usually in much\nthe same style and often with the same force.\nThe first of the four minor Upanishads in this collection, the Tejobindu,\nstresses the \u201cbeyondness\u201d of Reality and how the aspirant must rise beyond\nordinary experience and ordinary responses to be one with it: even \u2013 for\nHindu tradition does not shrink from this \u2013 beyond the guidance of the\nsacred texts themselves. It is a testimony to the value Hindu mysticism\nplaced on independence that the Upanishads and other texts exhort aspirants\nto transcend scripture itself in the search for one\u2019s own destiny.\nThe second text, Atma Upanishad, offers a very simple and effective\ntripartite model of this transcendence. The human being exists in an outer\nworld and an inner one, that is, in the physical body and environment and in\nthe realms of mind; yet there is something beyond both. In describing the\nworld within, the Atma does what all Upanishads do best: describe\nconsciousness with subtlety, profundity, and humor. The realm beyond\ncannot be described at all, but the effects of knowing it are extolled.\n\fThe next text in this selection, Amritabindu, is one of four or five\nUpanishads whose names end in bindu or \u201cdrop,\u201d indicating their succinct\ndistillation of wisdom. Amrita, \u201cimmortality,\u201d like its Greek cousin\nAmbrosia, was thought of in ritualistic and mythic contexts as a kind of\nliquid. This is not the Upanishad\u2019s conception. It concentrates on the mind\nas the seat of spiritual struggle. The mind is a \u201cwondrous power,\u201d as Sri\nRamana Maharshi said, and our destiny in life is determined by what we do\nwith that power. The opening line of the Dhammapada, a central text of\nTheravada Buddhism, is\n\u201cAll that we are is the result of what we have thought\u201d (more\nliterally, of mind).\nIf we neglect mind, the senses and lower forces in our inherited\nconsciousness take control of it; if we train it carefully, we can utilize its\npower to liberation \u2013 to immortality.\nThe Paramahamsa Upanishad, last in our selection, stresses that the\ninsignia of the religious pilgrim or mendicant are symbolic. Like the rituals\nobserved by householders, they are at best aids to the conditions of\nfreedom, love, and wisdom the seeker must establish within. In this regard\nthe Paramahamsa resembles descriptions of true spirituality found, for\nexample, in the last chapter of the Dhammapada (\u201cThe Brahmin\u201d) and still\nlater in the poems of Kabir. \u2013M.N.",

    "Afterword": {
        "A Religion for Moder Times": "The Upanishads have often been called the purest source of India\u2019s spiritual\ntradition. If we take the word pure to mean that they consist of essentials\nand are not tangled up in the changing circumstances of the culture that\nproduced and recorded them, we will see why they are not only still revered\nin India but have been discovered by individuals throughout the world as\ntreasures of needed wisdom \u2013 even though they are not particularly easy to\nread.\nOur age seems to need this kind of guidance more than ever. We are\npassing through a spiritual crisis that has been brought about by a wrong\nmessage about human nature and human happiness \u2013 a message so\npervasive that it makes up a global culture of its own. We need to turn to\nsources of wisdom wherever we can find them. Against this backdrop the\nwisdom tradition in general is indispensable, and the Upanishads in\nparticular have some attractive features recommending them as a way to\nmine that tradition and integrate the best it has to offer into our modern\nlives.\nFirst, the Upanishads offer a noble, exalted vision of human nature. To\nhear sages say, \u201cHear, O children of immortal bliss, you are born to be\nunited with the Lord,\u201d or to read the many \u201cladder\u201d images in the texts that\nshow us that our awareness of ourselves as physical bodies is a mere\nshadow of what we really are, brings a shock of recognition, a great relief.\nSecond, while the Upanishads are wrapped in a good bit of mythology\nand ritual, that wrapping comes off pretty easily. What we are left with is\npure mysticism: a penetrating and remarkably comprehensive vision of\nTruth that can give us inspiration and a direction \u2013 a beckoning goal and a\nway to reach it.\nThird, the Upanishads are scientific and experiential. They don\u2019t say,\n\u201cbelieve this\u201d; they say, \u201cThis we have seen: if you do x, y, and z, you can\nconfirm it for yourself.\u201d They offend neither our sense of logic nor our\nsense of responsibility for discovering truth for ourselves. More: their\noutlook is nonjudgmental. They speak with fervor about darkness and\n\fignorance, not with indignation about sin. They give us their glorious\ntestimony about reality and let us decide whether we want to realize it for\nourselves. Their universe is rigorously unforgiving in the sense that\nignorance is its own punishment, and rigorously redemptive in the sense\nthat wisdom is its own reward.\nAll this being said about the Upanishad\u2019s universality, the fact remains\nthat these conversations (as they seem to have been) were recorded very far\nback in time in a world that was very different from our own. They do\nrequire some getting used to. My familiarity with them grew as I learned\nmore about the world from which they had come; and this is what I will\nnow try to share.",
        "SONGS OF TRUTH": {
            "WHAT IS AN UPANISHAD?": "An Upanishad is an utterance of mystical truth that has come down to us as\nan attachment to the Vedas, the ancient and extremely sacred hymn\ncollections or Samhitas of the Indo-Aryans. These collections are four in\nnumber \u2013 Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva, in order of their age and their\npredominant interest in gods, ritual formula, chant, or magic spells. They\nand their adjuncts of almost equally ancient material form the textual basis\nto this day of India\u2019s major religious system. To be Hindu means in some\nsense to accept their authority, and since Hinduism is a decentralized\nsystem with diffuse institutional controls, there is almost no other criterion.\nAs one studies the Upanishads today it is useful to keep in view this\nseeming paradox of decentralized authority and unwritten stability.\nVeda (etymologically \u201csacred knowledge,\u201d or wisdom) means in the first\ninstance these four Samhitas or collections of inspired hymns directed to the\ngods of the Indo-Aryan pantheon and divinized aspects of the Vedic\nreligious ideology, such as fire, as well as some hymns so elusive we can no\nlonger tell what exactly they are celebrating. A second meaning of the word\nincludes three classes of texts which were soon attached to, and preserved\nwith, their respective Samhitas. The first are the Brahmanas, lengthy\ndescriptions of the Vedic rituals in a prose which is nearly that of classical\nSanskrit, containing a vast amount of lore and narrative from innumerable\nfamily traditions. These texts were basically manuals for the priests (also\nbrahmanas, \u201cbrahmins\u201d) responsible for the increasingly complex family\nand community rites. Second is a smaller and more intriguing group of texts\n\fknown as Aranyakas or \u201cforest manuals,\u201d continuations of the Brahmanas\nbut \u201cdealing with the speculations and spirituality of forest dwellers . . . ,\nthose who have renounced the world.\u201d[1] And third are the earliest\nUpanishads or \u201cconfidential sessions.\u201d[2] The Upanishads thus\nconsummate a line of development which begins with the official hymns of\nthe extended family that were recited at their public rituals and ends with\nutterances of universal import that a remarkable class of forest sages had\ngiven to their intimate disciples. For this reason, and because they are\nhanded down at the end of the Vedic collections and are meant to be learned\nand recited last by Vedic students, the Upanishads are classified as vedanta,\n\u201cthe end of the Vedas.\u201d\nIndian tradition makes a distinction between the Samhitas and\nBrahmanas, which deal mainly with ritual performance, and the Aranyakas\nand Upanishads, especially the latter, which deal with interpretation: what\nthe rituals, and then what things in general, mean. The technical terms for\nthese two divisions were karma kanda and jnana kanda, the portions\ndealing respectively with (ritual) action and spiritual knowledge. In the\nUpanishads themselves the former often serves as foil for the latter; that is,\nrituals become symbols of Self-realization, always an elusive state to\ndescribe in words.\nHowever they began, there are today about two hundred texts which go\nby the name of Upanishad \u2013 or, according to another classification, one\nhundred and eight, an auspicious number in Hinduism. Looked at as a\ngenre, these texts vary as drastically in content and spirituality as they do in\nage, ranging from the oldest prose Upanishads to some which are obviously\nmedieval. The transcendent authority of the older texts rises above sectarian\nforms of religion to represent the religion that Hindus originally called not\n\u201cHinduism\u201d but the sanatana dharma or \u201ceternal law.\u201d\nEarly in the eighth century A.D., in a period when Hinduism was losing\nits bearings, the great mystic and philosopher Shankara, knowing that only\nmystical experience could reinvigorate the tradition, composed remarkable\ncommentaries on ten of the Upanishads, giving them as it were a secondary\ncanonization by his authority, labor, and vast intellectual achievement \u2013 and\nrenewing Hinduism in the process. These ten Upanishads are listed by\nIndian tradition in the following order: Isha, Kena, Katha, Prashna,\nMundaka, Mandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka.\nThe Shvetashvatara is no less treasured today, and some scholars say that\n\fShankara wrote a commentary on it which has not survived. These eleven\nare commonly considered the principal Upanishads.\nThe class of people who taught in the forest ashrams of ancient India\nwere \u201capparently engaged,\u201d as D. S. Sarma points out, \u201cin the mighty task\nof transforming a rather low type of sacrificial religion prevalent at the time\ninto a great mystical religion true for all time.\u201d[3] It would be misleading to\nsay there was no trace of mysticism in the Samhitas; wherever there is a\nreal love of life there is a groundwork of mystical devotion, and the\nexuberance of the hymns, their total faith in the order of the universe (rita)\nand in man\u2019s place in nature, seen and unseen, their sense of the seriousness\nof human action \u2013 all these belong to a spirit of mysticism. Besides, the\nSamhitas and especially the oldest, the Rig Veda Samhita, contain\nimpressive profundity in speculation about the nature of being, time, and\nthe universe, as in the famous Nasadiya Sukta (.129.1.4), sometimes called\na \u201cbasis of the Upanishads\u201d:[4]\nAt first there was neither Being nor Nonbeing.\nThere was not air nor yet sky beyond.\nWhat was its wrapping? Where? In whose protection?\nWas water there, unfathomable and deep?\nIn the beginning Love arose,\nWhich was the primal germ cell of the mind.\nThe seers, searching in their hearts with wisdom,\nDiscovered the connection of Being in Nonbeing.\nWho really knows? Who can presume to tell it?\nWhence was it born? Whence issued this creation?\nEven the gods came after its emergence.\nThen who can tell from whence it came to be?\nThe Vedas give us glimpses into a mythological world which looks like\nthat of Greece, Rome, and the rest of Europe, but different. The\nUpanishadic universe also contains \u201cthree worlds,\u201d but these are not the\nunderworld, \u201cmiddle-earth,\u201d and heaven as in the West, but the visible\nworld, heaven (or the sky), and another plane that is far beyond phenomenal\nreality. The human being is not a puny speck in this cosmos, as we may\nappear physically. By virtue of a power called tapas (\u201cheat\u201d) generated by\nextreme austerity (also called tapas) or in deep stages of meditation,\n\fordinary men or women can compel profound changes in the universe. The\nhard line between mortality and immortality, between mankind and the\ngods, which Greek and Roman religion hammer home, is blurred and\ncrossable.\nWhen we get to the Upanishads themselves there is a new element,\nsomething almost disconcertingly different. It can be brought out in an\nimage which appears in the Rig Veda (I.164.20) and is repeated, sometimes\nverbatim, in several Upanishads:\nTwo birds of beautiful plumage, comrades\nInseparable, live on the selfsame tree.\nOne bird eats the fruit of pleasure and pain;\nThe other looks on without eating.\nWhen this image occurs in the Vedic context it\u2019s pretty clear that the bird\nthat does partake \u2013 that is, the person who enjoys the fruits of life \u2013 is being\nheld up for praise. In the Upanishadic contexts it is just the other way\naround: he or she who is not hypnotized by the ever-changing stream of\nphenomena but observes it in detachment is heading for the supreme human\ndestiny.\nSometimes the Upanishads draw attention to this discontinuity with a\nboldness of thought few cultures \u2013 not to say religions \u2013 have ventured, as\nwhen they openly state that the Vedas themselves are only aids to\nrealization which an already realized person no longer needs (Mundaka\nI.2.7). One way of looking at the decisive difference is that the religion of\nthe Samhitas centers on the gods, and the direct, enthusiastic invocation and\nworship of them at the sacrifice. In the Brahmanas, however, the intense\npower of the sacrifice itself (the original meaning of brahman) becomes the\nfocus, and the sacrifice which moves the gods is several times said to be\nmore powerful than they are. Then, finally, in the Aranyakas, power is seen\nto rest in man himself. There is a ground for mysticism in the Samhitas, but\nonly the Aranyakas and then decisively the Upanishads plant in that ground\nand cultivate it systematically.\nIt is because of this fundamental commitment to spiritual values and the\nfocus on human consciousness that the Upanishads may be regarded as the\nsource, insofar as texts are the source, of India\u2019s civilization. There is a\nmystical element at the heart of all great religious systems; but in India that\n\fmysticism has been established and systematically developed, to become \u2013\nto use a phrase of Schopenhauer\u2019s \u2013 \u201cthe faith of the people.\u201d\nHowever this happened, mysticism and the intense devotion that is\nalways a part of mysticism have become the heart of India\u2019s civilization,\nand if it survives the current corrosion of values by materialism the way it\nsurvived, in centuries past, the successive attacks of Mongols, Muslims, and\nBritish, the spiritual culture of India will be a precious resource for a world\nreawakening to the need for spiritual values. But for this to happen, some\ndifficulties that lie in the path of our understanding this culture must be\ncleared. Perhaps the most serious is simply the rarity of the experience they\nare attempting to describe. To this day, only a rare few human beings have\nactually had the experience of \u201cseeing\u201d reality from the perspective taken\nby these remarkable documents. The Self is \u201chidden in the deepest cave of\nthe heart.\u201d It cannot be perceived by the senses, like phenomena we can\nmeasure or describe. We have to build a road into the regions of\nconsciousness where we can \u201csee\u201d what lies there; we need an appropriate\nand sufficiently powerful organ of perception, what the Bhagavad Gita\n(II.8) calls the \u201cdivine eye.\u201d It is for this reason that the author of the Kena\nexclaims, \u201cWe do not know, we do not understand.\u201d (I.3).",
            " INDIAN CULTURE & TRADITION": "Rabindranath Tagore once pointed out that while the Greeks and Romans\nbuilt great cities, India\u2019s was a \u201cforest civilization.\u201d[5] Not that there were\nno great cities in ancient India \u2013 Harappa and Mohenjo Daro rose and fell\nbefore Mycenaean palaces were erected on the Greek mainland \u2013 but the\nessential continuity of the culture was developed and preserved by families\nliving in small communities close to nature long after splendid palaces and\nuniversities rose in those cities. This had profound consequences, as Tagore\nexplains, for the Hindu worldview. Like the Hebrews, the ancient Indians\ndistrusted the pace and pomp of urbandom, and distrusted it enough to resist\ncentral authority and conformism for thousands of years. Their trust in oral\ncreativity and preservation paid off, for India\u2019s is an extremely welldocumented civilization. More survives of classical Sanskrit than of ancient\nGreek and perhaps Latin literature put together: the Iliad, the Odyssey, and\nthe Aeneid would fit into one vast Indian epic, the Mahabharata, with room\nto spare for Lucian and some others.\n\fThese choices help to explain what meets us in the Upanishads: their\nintimacy, the bewildering variety of their outer form, the fact that they are\ncreative utterances of gifted individuals, even the way they were preserved\nas a precious inheritance in family traditions. It is this closeness to the\nindividual person that makes them, behind an austere facade, deeply\ndevotional.\nThe Upanishads are in some ways the archetype for other forms of Indian\nculture, most importantly perhaps in their grounding in the teacher-student\nrelationship. Not only in mysticism, but in Indian music and other arts it is\nthis reliance on person-to-person communication, both for teaching the\nindividual student and for perpetuating the parampara or \u201csuccession\u201d that\nkeeps the art alive for the whole culture.\nIndian aesthetics holds that the essence of every moment in an artistic\nperformance is its rasa, which corresponds to one of nine moods or\ndispositions, such as fear, erotic love, or devotion. If the Upanishads are an\narchetypal art form in that sense, what is their rasa? That question occupied\nIndian aestheticians a great deal, and their answer was skillful: the\nUpanishads come from the disposition of shanta, \u201cpeace,\u201d which is not\nreally a disposition or mood but what happens when all mental dispositions\nare brought to rest: again the Upanishads are an \u201cend of the Vedas.\u201d\nThe rasa theory also allowed Indian theorists to get a grip on what an\nUpanishad was essentially, rather than formally: whenever you have a truthutterance (a profound statement by someone in a higher state of\nconsciousness) you have an Upanishad. In this sense the Bhagavad Gita is\nan Upanishad, and the epic in which it is embedded, the Mahabharata,\nhowever violent on the surface, itself teaches detachment from worldly gain\nand communicates the predisposition of inner calm (shama) leading also to\nspiritual peace (shanta).[6]\nThis attention to theory and classification bring us to the fact that India\u2019s\nwas a highly scientific spirit, and this combination of science and devotion,\nof detached observation and mystical ecstasy, is one of the most arresting \u2013\nand useful \u2013 aspects of the Upanishads. It did not stop with them. When\nGandhi told the world that he had been instructed to undertake his \u201cepic\nfast\u201d in 1932 by \u201cthe voice of God,\u201d many asked how he knew he was not\nhaving a hallucination. He calmly told them, \u201cThe claim that I have made is\nneither extraordinary nor exclusive. God will rule the lives of all those who\nsurrender themselves without reservation to him.\u201d And he added, \u201cHere is\n\fno question of hallucination. I have stated a simple, scientific law that can\nbe verified by anyone who will carry out the necessary preparations. . . .\u201d\nWe are used to considering religion and science at odds \u2013 a divorce that\nmany consider very harmful. Gandhi\u2019s confident claim is an arresting\nrevelation, entirely in the spirit of the Upanishads.\nIf we judge a theory by its explanatory power, one of the most successful\nin the Upanishads is the theory of prana. The word may come from the\nprefix pra- \u201cforth\u201d (possibly used here as an intensifier) and the important\nroot an \u201cto breathe.\u201d As generally used, prana means \u201c(living) energy\u201d: all\nthe \u201cvital signs\u201d by which we try to identify the presence of life are tokens\nof the capacity of a body to direct, conserve, and employ energy at a high\nlevel of complexity. The Upanishadic sages worked out the primacy of\nprana over its various functions in the body by what we call thoughtexperiments. One might imagine, for example, what would happen if the\nindividual faculties (in Sanskrit, indriyas) leave a person one by one: as\nsight leaves, the person would go blind, and so forth, but still live. This is\nexactly what we find in the Brihadaranyaka (VI.1.7\u201313) and other\nUpanishads. But when prana itself makes ready to leave, \u201clike a great\nstallion pulling up the stakes by which he was tethered,\u201d all the faculties\ngather round and beg it to remain, declaring they have learned their lesson:\nthey all derive their existence from prana. Or one might imagine what\nwould happen if all the faculties left and came back to the inert body one by\none: how would sight function by itself if one were not conscious? This is\nthe Aitareya experiment, and there are others in the Prashna and elsewhere.\nThe sages are saying, as it were, \u201cIf our theory is correct, death should only\noccur when prana itself goes, and conversely life should resume when it\nreturns.\u201d\nThe sages testify that they have confirmed all this by direct observation \u2013\nbut that observation requires a highly trained observer. This is a principle\nknown in Western medieval philosophy as adaequatio rei et intellectu, the\n\u201csuitability of the cognitive equipment to its task\u201d: the senses and the mind\n(which Indians considered the chief sense) must be brought to a stillness,\nusually by assiduous training, in order for us to become aware of prana and\nwhat lies beyond even that.\nIn giving us these thought-experiments the sages probably had three\nthings in mind. First and foremost, they wanted to guide the cognitive\ngrowth of others who could be inspired to undertake the training required to\n\fperceive the life-process in this direct way. Second, they simply wanted to\nexplain life with the most powerful theory, which is why they are so\nrigorously logical. And finally they meant to put a science of health on a\nfirm basis \u2013 in other words, to say something true and useful about the\nprocess and the systems we call life. From this scientific basis the sages\nwere also able to explain, again drawing on their incredible skill at directing\nattention inward, the fivefold distribution of the body\u2019s energy, which is\nelaborated, including its relationship to other realities, in the Prashna and\nseveral other Upanishads.\nI hope I have illustrated that with a little getting used to, one can move\naround handily enough in the Indian system, which was quite scientific and\nrational in its own terms. Diversity is not disharmony. Without formal rules,\nHindus organized a vast collection of texts into categories and canonized\nthem in a system that was authoritative throughout Hindu culture. In this\nrespect India invites comparison with another ancient people with intense\nspiritual longings who remained decentralized, not by choice but by the\ndestruction of their political integrity: the Jews. In this description of the\nMishnaic inheritance we might almost be reading a description of the\nUpanishads:[7]\nThe Talmud is the repository of thousands of years of Jewish wisdom,\nand the oral law, which is as ancient and significant as the written law\n(the Torah), finds expression therein. It is a conglomerate of law,\nlegend, and philosophy, a blend of unique logic and shrewd pragmatism,\nof history and science, anecdotes and humor. It is a collection of\nparadoxes: its framework is orderly and logical, every word and term\nsubjected to meticulous editing, completed centuries after the actual\nwork of composition came to an end; yet it is still based on free\nassociation, on a harnessing together of diverse ideas reminiscent of the\nmodern stream-of-consciousness novel.\nEven more than diaspora Jewish tradition, the survival strategy of Indian\nculture was cumulative. This is a particularly useful generalization to bear\nin mind. India was probably the only country where three in many ways\ncontradictory systems of medicine, Indian, Arabic, and Greek, flourished\nside by side; a similar toleration extended to the successive stages of\nevolution in religious consciousness through which India passed. Outworn\n\fforms of religious worship were virtually never discarded \u2013 as Professor\nSarma points out, the sages did their job of moving people beyond their\n\u201crather low type of sacrificial religion . . . without in any explicit manner\nbreaking away from the traditions of the past.\u201d[8]\nThe resulting accumulation can be confusing because most traditions\nhave not been cumulative; they reject a \u201ccreed outworn\u201d when they move\non to a new stage. The ability to accommodate rather than reject older\nbeliefs has a very practical outcome. India has had its share of religious\nintolerance, but thanks to its paradigm of unity-in-diversity and its\ncumulative strategy for preserving culture, those individuals and\ncommunities who respond to outward forms of worship have kept their\nplace and dignity in the system, while at the other extreme individuals who\nhave really had mystical experience have been unusually free to transcend\nall religious forms and not only follow their own path but become beacons\nfor the culture as a whole. \u201cAs men approach me, so I receive them,\u201d Sri\nKrishna says in the Gita. \u201cAll paths, Arjuna, lead to me\u201d (Gita 4.11). This\ntoo helps explain the mixtures, or more properly layers, of religious\nconsciousness displayed in the Upanishads.",
            "THE LITERARY VEHICLE": "Although not many of the Upanishadic passages dealing with ritual and\nsacrifice are included in this or most other modern collections, the texts\u2019\nconcern with that aspect of religion went beyond the fact that technically\nthe Upanishads are commentaries on the Vedas. Ritual stood for all human\naction; sacrifice, once internalized, was the key idea of mysticism and thus\nbecame a perfect vehicle of continuity between the Brahmanas and the\ntexts\u2019 own interiorizing mystical vision. In the Upanishads\u2019 treatment of\nsacrifice we can learn many things about how they work as literary,\nphilosophical, and religious texts.\nMany Upanishadic passages have to be interpreted by two or more\n\u201ccodes\u201d (as literary critics say today), since a new set of meanings is\nmapped onto an older set of symbols.[9] The gods or devas of the natural\nworld are dramatizations of phenomena like rain and wind, but they also\nstand for parallel faculties in the human being. When Krishna says in the\nGita, \u201cThose who worship the gods go to the gods, but my devotees come\nto me\u201d (Gita 7. 23), he means that those who live in the sense-world end up\n\fstuck in the sense-world; but those who try to reach awareness of their inner\nSelf become completely realized.\nAt all stages of Indian civilization the world-process itself was\nconsidered a sacrifice. Even the gods carry out sacrifice, playing, just as\nhuman beings must, their role in the continuation of the cosmic cycle. But\nas we have seen, devas can stand for the sensory and motor faculties, divine\nenergy as experienced in the microcosm; Shankara elsewhere comments, \u201cIt\nis a fact established on the strength of the scriptures that speech and the\nother faculties are conscious through being presided over by conscious\ndeities.\u201d[10] So in this image of the gods offering sacrifice for the\ncontinuity of the cosmic process (or as that process) we also can see the\nbeginnings of one of the most important principles of mysticism, the\nprinciple of yajna or spiritual sacrifice: in order to reach the highest\nfulfillment, the human being returns vital energy to the process rather than\nclinging to it. In practical terms, he or she works for the well-being of the\nworld rather than for the gratification of personal desires, and therefore\neven eating is ideally a sacrifice meant to empower a selfless contribution\nto the world process. We encounter this repeatedly in the Upanishads; the\nFourth Question of the Prashna contains just this allegory of human life as\nsacrifice, and the spiritual principle of yajna is, as Gandhi said, the essence\nof the Isha, indeed of India\u2019s civilization.\nLikewise, when the Upanishads describe the soul as traveling through\nvarious realms after death, they are really referring to realms of psychic\nexperience we can have in this life. The Upanishads do not suppress but\nreuse the complex layers of symbolic thought they have inherited. If their\ninterest in sacrifices was a debt owed to their Vedic and Brahmanic home in\nthe literary tradition, it was a debt they paid cheerfully, for it gave them a\nperfect vehicle for their new message.\nIn the Katha and some other Upanishads we come across an expression\nthat means literally \u201ceating up the good works\u201d (karma) of someone or\nother. Karma means primarily the spiritual or ethically operational residue\nof every act. Thus not only a ritual act but every act is symbolic, in the\nsense that beyond its external, visible effects are the far more important,\ndeep-residing effects of every thought, word, and deed on our spiritual\nrelationships.\nThese effects entangle us in further relationships, making up our network\n\u2013 or net \u2013 of karma. Yet, as the Gita so eloquently says (3.4\u20136), it is absurd\n\fto think we have a choice not to act; even if we sit quietly our thoughts and\ndesires will go on driving through the world of karmic influence. How can\nwe ever be free of such a tangle? Precisely by learning more and more day\nby day to act in a spirit of yajna.\nIt was Gandhi who really brought this abstruse doctrine back to vibrant\nlife: act, by all means, but make your act, in the modern sense of the word,\na sacrifice. That is, he explained, choose a selfless goal, use right means\n(nonviolence), and never be pushed into action for your own benefit \u2013 a tall\norder. Gandhi was not waxing metaphorical when he called his programs\nfor the deliverance of India \u2013 and of the individual activist \u2013 yajna. By\ndrawing upon the not-to-be-denied need in all of us to work for a selfless\ngoal he elevated even his political campaigns to the level of models for\nevery action we might want to take today.\nWhat Professor Sarma called the sages\u2019 \u201cmighty task\u201d of making the\nHindu system valid for all time could be expressed in a single word:\ninteriorization. Interiorization does not mean giving up on external\nstruggles and satisfactions but rather reaching the center of the field where\nall satisfaction is ultimately achieved for us human beings. It does not mean\nlosing life; it means the sacrificer gets eternal life. The Upanishads share\nwith all sages the same high vision of what the human being can become:\nwithout sacrifice, we stop short of something that is essentially human.\nSeveral things about the Vedic sacrificial (and, more generally, ritual)\nbelief system made it relatively easy to develop that system mystically \u2013\nthat is, to interiorize it. At an early stage, for example, a certain type of\npriest was designated who officiated at the rituals mentally, not\nparticipating in the acts or recitations but going through them in his mind.\n[11] His role originally was the important one of protecting the performance\nagainst errors, which were felt to be dangerous and required elaborate\npurification; but that precedent of an interior run-through led to the\nprovision that one could actually perform the rituals mentally if the\nnecessary implements or personnel were not available \u2013 for example, in the\nforest. It was a relatively short step from this provision to the position that\nas far as the true purpose of religion goes, external rites \u2013 however suitable\nfor the short-term resolution of social problems \u2013 are unnecessary, or at best\nsymbolic. The real sacrifice could then be done directly, not just attempted\nby symbolic manipulations.\n\fAt the beginning of the Katha Upanishad we seem to have a\nrecapitulation of this historic process. Everything it describes has more than\none meaning. Nachiketa, a forthright youth who takes life seriously, is taken\naback by his father\u2019s sham sacrifice, but underneath he is actually frustrated\nwith the unreality of the world. His longing and his sincerity bring him face\nto face with the power of death. Given three boons, he chooses first of all to\nbe reconciled with his father and to escape the immediate danger of death\nhe is facing. Then \u2013 his relationship to death is becoming that of spiritual\naspirant before the supreme teacher \u2013 he asks and receives the knowledge\nof the fire sacrifice that \u201cleads to heaven.\u201d Then with the third boon comes\nthe point: \u201cO Death, having seen your face, how can I enjoy anything\nagain? Teach me the real secret: What are you? What happens when we die,\nand how can we not?\u201d He does not want to die and come back to life; he\ndoes not want to die and be remembered; finally he just does not want to\ndie.\nAnd he does not have to. Desire focused and unified at that depth opens\nfor him \u201cthe entire secret of meditation\u201d (Katha II.3.18) by which one\nleaves all separate individuality \u2013 and consequently all that is created and\nmust die \u2013 behind. These stages of the story reflect rather well the\ndevelopment of India\u2019s rich, complex, and cumulative religious history,\ndriven always by the quenchless desire for life that caused it to evolve into\none of the most highly developed \u2013 and inspiring \u2013 systems of mysticism in\nthe world.\nWe think of the Upanishads first and foremost as a well of deep meaning\n\u2013 their practical use to and effect upon us. But Indian pundits and scholars\nof old considered them also as a source of poetic beauty, and this beauty is\nnot entirely secondary. The Upanishads inherit from the Vedas a capacity\nfor inspired poetry. They speak, usually, in a less lyrical voice; on the other\nhand, they have even deeper access to the basic resource of all poetry,\nwhich is vision. Vision often produces poetry even when the Upanishads\nspeak in their most dogged prose; for example in highly imaginative\nimagery that can suddenly light up an elusive concept with deceptive\nsimplicity. These images stay in the mind; once we hear them, we will carry\nthem around like a torch, throwing light on life wherever we live it. When\nwe understand the purpose of the Upanishads and have grown used to their\naesthetic, reading them can be what it was meant to be: a deeply enjoyable,\nmoving, and even transformative experience.",
            "THE PHILOSOPHY": "To modern ears the word philosophy connotes a kind of dry, theoretical\nlearning which would be almost a travesty of the Upanishads\u2019 passion for\nexperiential realization. As the sages used the term, knowing is not a\nseparate activity from other aspects of being \u2013 courage, endurance,\nconcentration, will. There is such a thing as mere intellectual knowing, of\ncourse, but the Mundaka Upanishad, for example, begins by setting aside\nthis kind of knowing as apara, \u201cnontranscendent\u201d \u2013 that is, not dealing with\ntransformative experience. The Upanishads are concerned with para,\n\u201ctranscendent\u201d knowledge, \u201cby knowing which, all things are known\u201d (I.3)\nin a way that our being and our actions are transformed. For this kind of\nknowledge there were four nonintellectual prerequisites: discrimination,\ndetachment, self-control, and an \u201cirrepressible hankering after the\nrealization of truth.\u201d[12]\nOrdinary knowledge is either subjective or objective; transcendent\nknowing is neither. When a student in the Upanishads says, for example, \u201cI\ndid not know that such-and-such is Brahman,\u201d he means he has not yet\nrealized the identity of that thing with its source, precisely because he has\nbeen seeing it as a separate object. But according to mysticism \u2013 and to\nmodern physics \u2013 we cannot know anything objectively; it does not really\nexist independently of an observer, where both observer and observed are\nparticipating in consciousness.\nOn the other hand, neither can we know things subjectively as yet,\nbecause that would only be superimposing our own preconceived ideas on\nthings. The only way we can truly know something is to become identified\nwith it. We can become what we would know. \u201cIf [one] loves a stone, he\nbecomes a stone; if he loves a man, he is a man; if he loves God \u2013 I dare not\nsay more, for if I said that he would then be God, you might stone me.\u201d[13]\nThis, minus the final hesitation, is precisely the position of the sages.\nThe higher mode of knowing induced by intense selfless love and\nidentification produces powerful changes in the knower: \u201cWhatever they\n[knowers of Brahman] desire, the object of that desire arises from the power\nof their own thoughts; they have it and are happy\u201d (Chandogya VIII.2.1\u2013\n10). If these claims overdraw on the credulity of the modern reader, it is\nbecause we think naturally of the normal mode of knowing with which we\nare familiar. Earlier translators used to think the Upanishads were talking\nabout magic, especially when the symbolic code of the text happens to\n\fconcern ritual: \u201cHe who performs this rite knowing goes beyond death.\u201d\nWhat the sages mean is that if one sees through the symbolism of the ritual\nto its meaning and identifies with that inner core of meaning through\nspiritual union, rites become superfluous. For that knower they have\nfulfilled their purpose; they have lifted the performer\u2019s vision to the world\nbeyond death. Spiritual identification is caught from rather than taught by\nan illumined teacher. \u201cKnowing\u201d in the Upanishads is a code for that\nrealization.\nTradition has isolated four powerful formulaic utterances (mahavakyas)\nembedded in the early Upanishads. One is sarvam idam brahma, \u201cAll is\nBrahman\u201d (Chandogya III.14.1), which states the foundation of mysticism:\nthat everything is ultimately one. In the Vedic period, that belief had taken\nthe form of a great myth in which Purusha, or the prototypical \u201cPerson,\u201d\nwas made into our world by the primordial sacrifice; his head became the\nBrahmin class, his arms the Kshatriyas or ruler-warriors, and so forth. We\ncan say two things about the purport of this myth: it affirms the unity of life\nin a common source (Christian writers would make the same point about\nour common ancestor, Adam), and it affirms the order, or meaning, in the\nUniverse: there is rita \u2013 harmony, regularity \u2013 underlying all seemingly\nrandom change. And that harmony or order prevails not only in the material\norder, making science possible; it is also seen in the laws that govern the\nconscious or moral dimensions of existence.[14]\nWhat the myth does not tell us, being a myth, is the most important\nconsequence of these beliefs: that a human being can reverse the process of\ncreation which proceeded from singularity to diversity: not just retrace it,\nfor example, in science or philosophy, but reverse it, so that one withdraws\nfrom the world of change and follows what St. Augustine called the \u201chidden\nfootprint of unity\u201d that is there, perhaps covered but never eradicated in our\nconsciousness. [15]\nThe Upanishads never stray far from this purpose. Take the episode of\nUddalaka and his son Shvetaketu (Chandogya VI.1\u201316). The latter has\ncome home from his traditional twelve years\u2019 study under a brahmin\nteacher \u201cproud of his learning in the scriptures\u201d but unaware of the purpose\nof that learning. In this case the father must be his real teacher. Uddalaka\nfirst shakes him out of his complacency with a spiritual version of \u201cWhat\ndid you learn at school\u201d: \u201cDid they teach you That by which everything else\nis known?\u201d Then, as soon as the boy is ready to grasp that truth of truths, he\n\fhas him dissolve salt in water, dissect a mustard seed, and perform other\nexperiments that by analog or induction yield insights into the one Reality\nunderlying all phenomena. These are not chemistry or biology lessons: each\ntime Shvetaketu has such a flash of insight Uddalaka tells him, \u201cShvetaketu,\nyou are That.\u201d\nThis is one of the central passages in the Upanishads, and its teaching\nthat the supreme Reality can be found in the humblest and most ordinary\nobjects \u201cas fire lies hidden in firestick, butter in cream, water in springs\u201d\n(Shvetashvatara I.15) is fundamental in the Upanishadic worldview. Not\nsurprisingly, \u201cYou are That\u201d (tat tvam asi) is one of the mahavakyas.[16]\nShvetaketu\u2019s sudden awakening is uncharacteristic; in most anagogic\npassages of the Upanishads the process is by gradual stages. When King\nJanaka asks Yajnavalkya, \u201cWhat is the light of man?\u201d (Brihadaranyaka\nIV.3.11 ff), the sage first cites the sources of visible light \u2013 sun, moon, fire \u2013\nin diminishing order of brightness. Then he moves on to speech, by which\nwe can \u201csee\u201d in the sense we can orient ourselves and carry out actions\neven in darkness. Finally he comes to the Self. That Self, Reality, or the\ndivine ground of existence, does indeed exist in all things, or they would\nnot exist; but to discover it we must slowly learn to peel back layers of\nreality like an onion.\nThere is an endless variety of such hierarchies in the Upanishads, all with\na common pattern. They move from the inanimate world to some forms of\nconsciousness (seeing, speech) to consciousness itself, or from outer things\nto our awareness of things \u2013 or feelings, or thoughts \u2013 to our Self, the\nultimate witness. We are always being led back to that center from whatever\nperimeter to which the endless outward migrations of the mind have carried\nus.\nThis can be sometimes put, at least at first, in objective terms, because\nstacked up behind everything we perceive is the series of causes that\nbrought it into existence, beginning with the First Cause of phenomenal\nexistence itself (Katha I.3.10). At the heart of any apparently separate thing\nlurks its essence \u2013 its rasa, literally \u201csap\u201d \u2013 that brought that thing into\nbeing. When we see the essence, the thing itself has served its purpose: in\nthe earthy language of the Upanishads, \u201cthe subtle eats the gross.\u201d[17] The\nrasa of anything is subtler than it; it is its cause, its explanation, and the key\nto its significance; it is more real \u2013 more long-lasting \u2013 and the next step\ncloser to the ultimate reality beyond both the knower and the known.\n\fBut it is more illuminating to look at the theory in subjective terms.\nBehind the act lies the motive; the former in the world of material\ninteraction, the latter in the world of thought and desire. In one sense the\n\u201ccause\u201d of the light in my study is electricity; in a more important sense it is\nmy wish to have it there. If I fall asleep, there will be no \u201clight\u201d in the\nroom: it\u2019s a participatory study, in this participatory universe.\nAll search for essences and for the ultimate relationship ends with Atman,\nthe Self. This concept is the glory of the Upanishads. The etymology of the\nword is not entirely certain, but most likely it is derived from an, \u201cto\nbreathe,\u201d and thus shares an important linguistic as well as philosophical\nconnection with prana. This richness of meaning is testimony to the very\nsimplicity of the concept. Atman just means \u201cself\u201d; in Sanskrit it was used\nas the reflexive pronoun. Yet so much is contained within that simple\nconcept: untold energy and devotion, the explanatory power of a scientific\nformula, the evocative power of poetry, and finally the sheer drama of the\ntremendous discovery made by the sages over and over again \u2013 one of the\nmost authoritatively verified hypotheses in the universe \u2013 that the Self is\nGod.\nThis Self cannot possibly be subject to any change, not even death. This\nis perhaps why belief in reincarnation died hard even in the West. It was a\ncherished belief not only in pagan but in various Jewish and Christian\ngroups in the early centuries of our era, but was brusquely rejected by the\nemerging orthodoxy and seems an unsettling and unverifiable hypothesis to\nmost of us today. Yet it differs only slightly, almost by a question of\nsemantics, from the modern concept of evolution, which holds that the\nindividual dies with the death of the physical body. Indian religious systems\nhold as a core belief that the individual is not that which dies: it is more\naccurate to think of ourselves as the forces which brought our body and\npersonality into existence \u2013 forces that will continue shaping our destiny\nbeyond what we call death, \u201cas the wind takes on the fragrance from the\nflower\u201d (Gita 15.8).\nThe ultimate Self, however, never entered into any of these processes but\nsomehow governs them all. It is neither that which dies nor those shaping\nforces, but the Witness of all this evolution. The Self is untouched by the\nturmoil of the world, \u201cobserving without partaking\u201d (the two birds\u2019 image),\na bulwark that sorrow cannot broach (Chandogya VIII.4.1\u20132). Only because\nwe think the Self is yoked to its temporary instruments, the body, mind, and\n\fsenses, do we think it enjoys or dislikes anything in one little corner of the\ncosmic process (Katha I.3.4). But it is present everywhere. The Self has\n\u201centered into everything like a razor fitted into its case\u201d or (Augustine and\nSt. Teresa use the same image) into every creature \u201cup to the nails\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka I.4.7). The Self alone has no essence, no cause, being the\ncause and essence of everything and everyone.\nOne might expect on the basis of such a revolutionary theory of being, or\nmetaphysics, an equally well-developed theory of our relationship to things\nand people and how, if we have happiness in view, we ought to behave\ntowards them. This expectation is not disappointed by the Upanishads, in\nwhich metaphysics and ethics are one.\nThe central value of Hinduism, declared in a formula known mostly from\nlater narrative literature, is ahimsa paramo dharma: \u201cThe highest religion,\nthe ultimate law of our being, is nonviolence.\u201d This value is implicit, and\nsometimes explicit (Chandogya IV.17.4) in the Upanishadic teaching of\nunity. Before we explore it, however, let us look at a complementary\nteaching which is equally surprising and perhaps even less easily\nunderstood.\nOne of the critical \u201csecrets\u201d of the Upanishads is that renunciation is the\nopposite of deprivation. When the senses (indriyas) are untrained they run\nwild, leading to a state of conditioning that is the opposite of freedom\n(Katha I.2.5\u20136). Joy comes from putting these faculties back on track under\nthe guidance of the Self. This is precisely why the Upanishads teach\nrenunciation. Not only are joy and renunciation not contradictory; they\npositively require each other. Taken together they form the key value of\nHinduism, as Mahatma Gandhi taught when he took for his own mahavakya\nthose three opening words of the Isha Upanishad: tena tyaktena bhunjitah,\n\u201cRenounce and enjoy.\u201d\nIn the Gita, desire is referred to once as the rasa of objects, i.e., the\nobjects of sense experience (II.59, a verse which meant a very great deal to\nGandhi). Since a thing\u2019s essence is more permanent than its material\nembodiment, it stands to reason that if we could somehow enjoy that\nessence directly, our enjoyment would be more permanent than sensory\ncontact with the thing itself. A sense of joy and happiness within is longerlasting than the sensation of pleasure, which is notoriously short-lived. One\nof the boldest treatments of this theory of satisfaction occurs in the Katha:\n\fThat through which one enjoys form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and\nsexual union is the Self. Can there be anything not known to one who is\nthe One in all? . . . That which enjoys the honey [rasa] from the flowers\nof the senses is the Self. (Katha II.1.3)\nWe lose nothing in this process; in St. Francis de Sales\u2019s fortuitous\nimage, when the sun rises the light of a star does not go out, but \u201cis ravished\ninto and absorbed in the sun\u2019s sovereign light, within which it is happily\nmingled and allied.\u201d[18] Nor do the senses or the body generally suffer\nwhen we control them voluntarily. Free from the popular misconception\nabout self-tormenting \u201cyogis,\u201d Upanishadic students pray, \u201cMay my senses\nwax clear and strong.\u201d That is why they trained them.\nThis whole question is so important that I would like to make another\npass through this logic, as the Upanishads would, from a slightly different\npoint of view. If we could trace where a desire arises from \u2013 and the\nUpanishads do, repeatedly \u2013 we would find that in most cases something \u2013\na thought, an external event \u2013 has stirred up some wisp of the vague sense\nof incompleteness we harbor beneath the floor of surface consciousness as\nlong as we are not identified with our Self. We immediately misinterpret\nthis stirring as a desire for something outside us. This is maya:\nmisinterpreting the longing for union within as a call from something\noutside the Self.\nThe Upanishads go a step further. When we have the sensation \u201cI want\nsuch-and-such,\u201d what we really mean is that we want the relative tranquility\nthat follows when that desire subsides. As a great sage of modern India, Sri\nRamana Maharshi, who was very close to the Upanishads in spirit, once\ndeclared, \u201cThere is no happiness in any object of the world.\u201d The Self is\npure happiness, which we mistake as coming from outside; so the closer we\ncome to the Self within, the more we are aware of \u2013 the more we feel\nalready \u2013 what we were looking for outside us. This is what the Upanishads\nmean by joy. \u201cRenunciation\u201d refers simply to dropping the outside\nreflection for the reality which is within.\nFreedom is one of the most passionate concerns of the Upanishads, and a\nname of one of the oldest, Kaivalya.[19] But another Sanskrit word for\nfreedom, swaraj, appears in the Chandogya as well as the Kaivalya, and this\nword was the rallying cry Mahatma Gandhi used in the successful Indian\nstruggle for independence from British rule. Of course, what the\n\fUpanishads meant by swaraj was inner, personal freedom; but that is\nexactly what Gandhi meant by it too. \u201cThe word swaraj is a sacred word,\u201d\nhe said, \u201ca Vedic word, meaning self-rule and self-restraint, and not\nfreedom from all restraint which \u2018independence\u2019 often means.\u201d\nIt is typical of the Upanishads\u2019 approach to life not to check or negate\npassions but to channel them, reconnecting them with their original source\nin deeper consciousness. In Upanishadic psychology, the inner demand all\nhuman beings feel for freedom is ultimately a drive to free ourselves from\nthe inherited and acquired compulsions in our own psychic makeup. The\nUpanishads do not deny the need for political freedom; they simply claim\nthat inner freedom comes first, and is really the only reliable guarantee of\nall other forms. The more freedom one wins within, through control over\none\u2019s own thoughts and passions, the less one will be manipulable by\nothers, and the more one will be able to seek political freedom \u2013 without\ngoing on to manipulate others oneself.\nThus we see that whereas the Upanishads were not nitishastra, textbooks\nof political counsel, they contained germs of profound richness for the\nalleviation of political and other relations. The imaginative setting of the\nUpanishads is a stable and perhaps idealized world of kings and brahmins\n(and birds and beasts, and gods), and the sages do not say much about how\nthat world, much less one like ours, should be organized. Yet their feelings\nabout those aspects of life also come through, sometimes in the most\nunexpected contexts. This passage is in the profoundly mystical eighth\nchapter of the Chandogya Upanishad:\nHere [in this world] people do what they are told, becoming dependent\non their country, or their piece of land, or the desires of another, so their\ndesires are not fulfilled and their works come to nothing, both in this\nworld and in the next\n. . . but those who leave here knowing who they are and what they truly\ndesire have freedom everywhere, both in this world and in the next.\n(Chandogya VIII.1.5\u20136)\nThis modern-sounding scorn for \u201cdoing what you are told\u201d comes as a bit\nof a shock in this stable world presided over by religious, family, and royal\nauthority; but a closer look reveals that while the social structure of that\nworld is stable, the sages don\u2019t hesitate to take this structure apart and show\n\fus where the underlying sources of authority are, or should be: more than\none proud brahmin has to take lessons from a king who turns out to enjoy\ndeeper spiritual experience (cp. Brihadaranyaka II.1.1\u201315); more than one\nteenager like Nachiketa pulls the wraps off a sham sacrifice or flings sham\nrewards back at the delighted king of death (cp. Katha). In this view\nfreedom and authority come together, like renunciation and joy. The truly\nfree man or woman is svamin, literally \u201cin full possession of self.\u201d He or\nshe exercises a spontaneous authority over others: not the authority that\ndebases others but that ennobles them, not the authority that distances but\nthat draws to intimacy, not the authority of birth or social advantage but of\nthe ability to forget oneself in the welfare of others, which anyone can\nlearn. \u201cReal Swaraj will come,\u201d Gandhi said, \u201cnot by the acquisition of\nauthority by a few, but by the acquisition of the capacity by all to resist\nauthority when it is abused.\u201d Gandhi\u2019s last phrase shows how he had\ninternalized the vision of the sages that in the ideal world, while there\nwould have to be authority of each over himself, there could also be\nstructures of authority among others, so long as these were exercised\nselflessly. The issue of authority is not, as often in our polarized world, yes\nor no, but what kind.\nThese basic principles lead naturally to two other \u201cpolitical\u201d\nconsiderations, one of which we have touched on. Gandhi\u2019s \u201cdiscovery\u201d of\nnonviolence was Upanishadic to the core. It was an innate response to the\nat-homeness in the world that breathes through every line of those texts.\nAnd we find some principles of nonviolence well articulated: If one is\nsocially or by personality weak with regard to another (that is, not yet\nsvamin oneself), one still need not be exploited: \u201cfor by dharma even the\nweak man can hope to prevail against a king\u201d (Brihadaranyaka I.4.14, with\nShankara\u2019s comment).[20] This dharma is nothing other than nonviolence;\nas we have seen, ahimsa paramo dharma, \u201cThere is no higher dharma than\nnonviolence.\u201d It is a fact not to be glossed over that Gandhi, one small man,\nprevailed against the British Empire in the height of its historic majesty\nwith that secret. Can there be a secret more necessary to learn?\nWhile various thinkers today have remarked how modern physics seems\nto reflect the vision of the forest sages, few have noticed how another\nsignificant discovery of ours was long anticipated by them: the concept of\nunity in diversity. Originally popularized by Hegel, this mildly paradoxical\ntheme is becoming central in discussions of how a nation or even the world\n\fshould be organized, for a very simple reason: the world needs, as Richard\nFalk has put it, \u201cthe maximum degree of spontaneous solidarity.\u201d But what\nkind of solidarity? A megagovernment? If this is to be world order, one may\nbe excused for preferring chaos. When he begins to specify the\nrequirements for true solidarity Professor Falk sounds almost Upanishadic:\nthe goal must be \u201cthe maintenance of living systems at all levels of\ncomplexity . . . the exploration of space and the planetary character of\neconomic, ecological, and cybernetic complexity are building the\nfoundations of an inevitable global consciousness.\u201d[21] We want a new\nprinciple of political order which does not depend upon or induce\nuniformity among peoples, but which, tolerant of complexity, promotes the\nfullest unfolding of their individual potential \u2013 which happens to be a\ndefinition of nonviolence.[22]\nThe Upanishads of course specialize in diversity; in fact they revel in it\nas the essential character of life:\nHe is this boy, he is that girl, he is this man, he is that woman, and he is\nthis old man, too, tottering on his staff. His face is everywhere. He is the\nblue bird, he is the green bird with red eyes, he is the thundercloud, and\nhe is the seasons and the sea. (Shvetashvatara IV.3\u20134)\nBut the forest vision of life balances this love of diversity in living beings\nwith an unwavering focus on the unity which is life\u2019s center.\nThe concept of dharma, though not as developed in the Upanishads as in\nthe narrative and sutra texts that followed, shows the same apparent tension\nbetween a universal Law unchanging in any time or circumstance \u2013 the\ndharma, properly speaking \u2013 and the less well known concept of\nsvadharma, each individual\u2019s own law or way.[23] The Gita sternly\ndescribes how each must discover and earnestly follow his or her own path\nor perish spiritually: \u201ccompetition in another\u2019s dharma breeds fear and\ninsecurity\u201d (Gita 3.35).\nIn the end, unity in diversity is not a paradox at all. Unity is the center \u2013\nin Upanishadic terms, \u201cin the cave of the heart\u201d \u2013 of conscious beings,\nwhile diversity flourishes on the surface of life. It is as necessary to foster\ndiversity there at the outside as it is to hold unity on the inside. Gandhi\nmade this notion of inside and outside concrete for us: there must be \u201cheart\nunity\u201d among all, meaning spontaneous concern for the welfare of others,\n\fand that very concern must lead to complete toleration of natural\ndifferences and even differences of wealth and station (which did not please\nhis Marxist critics) as long as they are not abused. Class, family, and\nregional groupings are a sort of bridge between the unity toward which all\nmust be allowed to work and the individuality from which we start. The\nmore the heart can be opened in spontaneous concern for the other, the less\nof an obstacle and more of a vehicle for social coherence \u2013 and in the end\nspiritual unity \u2013 intermediate unities become.[24]\nUnity in diversity formed the cornerstone of India\u2019s national\nconsciousness from ages past; it may yet form her contribution to a global\nconsciousness which, as S. Radhakrishnan has said, the world has no choice\nbut to develop.",
            "THE CURVE OF HISTORY": "Since the discovery of the Upanishads by the West, not a few Westerners\nhave gone to them as a source of the \u201cperennial philosophy,\u201d a fascinating\nwitness to an ancient civilization and its unique religious system; others,\nlike Yeats, have been drawn by their poetic beauty. But the first Western\nphilosopher to stumble on them, Arthur Schopenhauer, was looking for\nmuch, much more. And they did not disappoint him. In his oft-quoted\nwords: \u201cThey have been the consolation of my life, and will be the\nconsolation of my death.\u201d[25]\nIt is not hard to appreciate his reaction. One of the closing statements in\nthe first book of the Chandogya reads, \u201cWhoever meditates and gains this\nwisdom here in this life lives at his highest and his best\u201d (I.9.4), and\nShankara comments, \u201cPeople may think, \u2018Though such rewards might have\naccrued for the blessed ancients, they cannot be possible for people in this\nage.\u2019 The text proceeds to set aside this notion.\u201d\nWe too can set aside the notion that the Upanishads are irrelevant\ncuriosities. Because of the intense problems of our times, problems that\nseem to be created by specifically modern conditions, we naturally tend to\nthink we have broken the thread of history: Shankara did not have to face\necological degradation, terrorism, and nuclear war. But these problems arise\nfrom unresolved human difficulties that have been the same throughout\nrecorded history. Ecological degradation is ultimately caused by human\ngreed, as greed and alienation lie behind all forms of crime; war arises, as\nthe UNESCO constitution says, \u201cin the minds of men,\u201d and persists when\n\fmen and women shrink from the age-old task of learning to resolve their\nconflicts. Whether we live in a forest ashram or in downtown Los Angeles,\nthe job of being human means learning to convert our inherited tendencies\nfrom problems into positive forces. Ours is not therefore a predicament on\nwhich the experience of the past falls silent.\nSchopenhauer predicted that others would soon react to the Upanishads\nas he had; that, in fact, the sole advantage his own enlightened century\ncould claim over the benighted seventeenth would be its possession of those\nwonderful documents, which would cause a revolution in human\ncivilization. In this, it would appear, the old pessimist was wrong. The\nnineteenth century and the twentieth have come and gone, and have brought\nneither enlightenment nor even \u2013 unless we are beginning to see it just now\n\u2013 the kind of open-mindedness Schopenhauer could have toward the\nachievements of a very different culture.\nIt is not that there has never been mysticism in the West. In fact, when\nthe Western experiment with rationalism and scientific thinking began more\nthan twenty-five hundred years ago and Greek thinkers, mainly in Asia\nMinor, struggled to free themselves from the mental universe of myth and\nsymbol, the paradigm or system of thought they came up with was very like\nthat of their Indian counterparts who had laid the basis of the Vedanta some\ncenturies earlier. One thinks particularly of Heraclitus of Ephesus (ca. 540\u2013\n475 B.C.). We remember Heraclitus for the saying \u201call is in flux,\u201d but he\nwas much more excited about his discovery that underneath the flux of the\nphenomenal world exists aiezoon pyr, \u201ceverliving fire\u201d (probably a symbol\nof consciousness, for which the Greeks had as yet had no single term),\nwhich ordinary human beings do not perceive but to which they owe such\nknowledge as they possess. This living fire that becomes all things reminds\nus forcibly of prana.\nIn a supremely important fragment Heraclitus declares, \u201cYou may search\nthe limits of the soul without ever finding them, go down any road you will;\nsuch a profound reality it has\u201d (Fr. 45). It would not be unfair to suggest\nthat we have taken the scientific worldview he made possible to its very\nlimits in the opposite direction: happiness is caused by endorphans, mother\nlove is programmed by genes and triggered by chemicals; a full-page ad in\nmy university\u2019s magazine recently boasted a picture of a chromosome with\nthe heading, \u201cThis is your life.\u201d The soul has so shrunken from view that far\nfrom standing awestruck by its infinitude we have difficulty remembering\n\fthat it exists: indeed, why speak of soul; mind or consciousness play no role\nin the electrochemical image of the human being which popular\nimagination and some scientists today present unchallenged.\nBut the time has come to challenge them. It is curious to look back from\nthis vantage point and observe that the similarities between the founders of\nWestern thought and the scientist-sages of the forest are so striking that\nfrom time to time Western scholars keep trying to find out whether the latter\nsomehow influenced these \u201cIonian physicists\u201d who awakened Western\nphilosophy and science in the generation before Socrates directly.[26] Such\nan influence would not be unlikely. Yet at no time has the \u201cUpanishadic\u201d\nvision of a Heraclitus or an Augustine really become our own. Here the\nUpanishads challenge us to put in place fundamentally different concepts of\nwho we are, and to build a life of thoughts, of personal habits, of lifestyle,\nof relationships, of institutions and values, and finally even of foreign\npolicy based on the unity of consciousness rather than on the separateness\nof biochemical fragments.\nCultural and historical prejudices are loosening now, and that may mean\nwe have an unparalleled opportunity to forge the kind of shift in paradigm\nwe need to survive and grow as a united world \u2013 and perhaps Schopenhauer\nafter all had seen this coming. In the full text of his oft-quoted remarks on\nthe Upanishads we meet a bit of a surprise:\nFrom every sentence deep original and sublime thoughts arise, and the\nwhole is pervaded by a high and holy and earnest spirit. In the whole\nworld . . . there is no study . . . so beneficial and so elevating as that of\nthe Upanishads. They are destined sooner or later to become the faith of\nthe people.[27]\nSchopenhauer foresaw not one but two major revolutions: first, that the\nbarrier between East and West would fall, permitting a more helpful crosscultural borrowing than had ever been the case \u2013 which, as I say, we are\nalready beginning to see happen. But second, and even more daring, he\npredicted that a profound, visionary way of seeing, willing, and seeking\nfulfillment will become not just the thought-experiment of philosophers, as\nhad happened at the beginning of Western scientific history, but \u201cthe faith\nof the people.\u201d\n\fOf all the sources of India\u2019s vision, Schopenhauer was drawn by unerring\ninstinct to the Upanishads. He was trying to draw our attention not to\nHinduism or India, but to a habit of looking beneath the surface of life to its\nunderlying causes, to an at-homeness in the world with its infinite variety of\ncreatures and natural beauty \u2013 our home and the only laboratory of our\ndestiny \u2013 to tremendous insights into the nature of power, to a plan for\nworld unity that seems to be embedded in every particle of reality, to a\nreminder that, as the Maitri Upanishad states, \u201cOne becomes like that which\nis in one\u2019s mind \u2013 this is the everlasting secret\u201d;[28] and most of all to the\ncourage to discover in ourselves a higher image of the human being. These\nare the gifts and the challenge of the Upanishads."
