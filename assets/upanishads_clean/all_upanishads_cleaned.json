    "Isa": "om that is full this is full for from the full the full indeed arises\n when the full is taken from the full what remains is full indeed\n om peace peace peace \n all this should be covered by the lord whatsoever moves on the earth\n by such a renunciation protect yourself \n covet not the wealth of others\n by performing karma in this world as enjoined by the scriptures should one yearn to live a hundred years\n thus action does not bind you the doer\n there is no other way than this\n those worlds of asuras demons are enshrouded by blinding gloom\n those who are the slayers of the self go to them after death\n unmoving it is one faster than the mind\n the senses cannot reach it for it proceeds ahead\n remaining static it overtakes others that run\n on account of

full for from the full the full indeed arises\n when the full is taken from the full what remains is full indeed\n om peace peace peace here ends the isavasyopanishad as contained in the sukla yajur veda\n commentary on the isavasya upanishad by swami nirmalananda giri seeing all things in god an instructive story just before going to india for the first time in i had the great good fortune to meet and hear sri a\n purani the administrator of the renowned aurobindo ashram of pondicherry india\n from his lips i heard the most brilliant expositions of vedic philosophy nothing in my subsequent experience has equaled them\n in one talk he told the following story in ancient india there lived a most virtuous brahmin who was considered by all to be the best authority on philosophy\n one day the local king ordered him to appear before him\n when he did so the king said i have three questions that puzzle even torment me where is god why do not i see him and what does he do all day if you cannot answer these three questions i will have your head cut off\n the brahmin was appalled and terrified because the answers to these questions were not just complex they were impossible to formulate\n in other words he did not know the answers\n so his execution date was set\n on the morning of that day the brahmin s teenage son appeared and asked the king if he would release his father if he the son would answer the questions\n the king agreed and the son asked that a container of milk be brought to him\n then the boy asked that the milk be churned into butter\n that too was done\n the first two of your questions are now answered he told the king\n the king objected that he had been given no answers so the son asked where was the butter before it was churned in the milk replied the king\n in what part of the milk asked the boy\n in all of it\n just so agreed the boy and in the same way god is within all things and pervades all things\n why do not i see him then pressed the king\n because you do not churn your mind and refine your perceptions through meditation\n if you do that you will see god\n now let my father go\n not at all insisted the king\n you have not told me what god does all day\n to answer that said the boy we will have to change places\n you come stand here and let me sit on the throne\n the request was so audacious the king complied and in a moment he was standing before the enthroned brahmin boy who told him this is the answer\n one moment you were here and i was there\n now things are reversed\n god perpetually lifts up and casts down every one of us\n in one life we are exalted and in another we are brought low oftentimes in a single life this occurs and even more than once\n our lives are completely in his hand and he does with us as he wills\n the brahmin was released and his son was given many honors and gifts by the king\n the isha upanishad opens with the answer to the question as to god s whereabouts\n he is within all in the heart of all things of whatever there is in the universe dwells the lord\n whatever we experience whether through the inner or outer senses it is a covering of the lord isha \n since it conceals it necessarily blinds confuses or inhibits us\n it is a door closed in our face\n tragically throughout lives wiyout number we have not known this simple fact and have as a consequence believed that the experienced whether objective or subjective is the sole reality and have dissipated life after life in involvement with it to our pain and destruction\n a door is never the way out the way out is revealed when the door is moved aside eliminated\n not knowing this either we have clawed hammered and hewn at the door at least in those lives when we were not adulating and worshiping it or calling it god s greatest gift to us to no avail\n the root problem is our believing in the door s reality thinking that it is the beginning middle and end\n only when it disappears will we see the truth that lies beyond things\n we must not just get inside things we must get to their heart\n and how is that done by getting into our own heart into the core of our own being\n there everything will be found\n the key to the door is meditation\n another viewing prabhavananda has conveyed the ultimate message of these opening words of the isha upanishad\n the literal translation however gives us another view which we should consider all this whatever exists in this changing universe should be covered by the lord\n rather than speaking of piercing to the heart of things the literal meaning is that the lord should be seen covering that is enveloping all things\n this has two meanings\n what i have just expressed that we should experience not just think intellectually that god is encompassing all things that we should not see things as independent or separate from god but as existing within god\n and this vision should extend to us we too exist only within him\n in our seeing of things god should always be between us and them\n first we should see god and only secondarily see the things\n the renowned swami papa ramdas in his spiritual autobiography in quest of god writes of his initial spiritual awakening in these words it was at this time that it slowly dawned upon his mind that ram was the only reality and all else was falseall yought all mind all heart all soul was concentrated on ram ram covering up and absorbing everything\n in the bhagavad gita considered to convey the essence of the upanishadic wisdom both prabhavananda s and the literal translations are put together when krishna tells arjuna that the wise see god in all things and all things in god\n he is all if we accept the foregoing then we will take the next step and experience that he alone is the reality\n this can be understood more than one way\n we can conclude that god alone is real and everything else is unreal\n the problem with that is our tendency to equate unreal with non existent and wrongly belief that everything is only an illusion that it has no reality whatsoever\n the great non dual philosopher shankara explained the accurate view by likening our experience of things to that of a man who sees a rope in dim light and mistakes it for a snake his mind even supplying eyes that glitter and a mouth that hisses at him\n when light is brought he sees that there is no snake only a rope\n the snake was not real but his impression however mistaken was real\n the snake was not real it was nonexistent but the impression of the snake was real and did exist\n the rope was the reality and the snake was an illusion overlain on it\n in the same way god is the reality and everything else is illusory like the snake\n but illusion does exist\n denying it gets us nowhere we have to deal with it by seeing through it by dispelling it\n then we will see the reality god\n after that we can progress to the understanding that even yough our interpretation may be wrong what we perceive does have a real side to it and that is god himself\n hence all things are god in their real side\n the wrong side is in our mind alone\n we can say that god is the reality of the unreal which we need to see past\n and that is the whole idea of the opening verse of the upanishad\n he alone is real he is all things\n be at peace wherefore renouncing vain appearances rejoice in him\n all of our sorrows and troubles come from our mistaking vain appearances for reality from our looking at them with our outer eyes instead of beholding god with the inner eye\n but we are addicted to those vain appearances we have to admit that\n yes we are even addicted to all the pain and anxiety they bring us\n that is foolish but is it any more foolish than it is to be addicted to drugs or alcohol or to people that harm us we are insane on certain levels this world is a madhouse for people of our particular lunacy\n the sooner we understand this and resolve to be cured and released the better things will be for us\n for from things we will move on to god perception\n for this reason the yogis those who seek god in meditation should be the most cheerful and optimistic of people\n if we look to god we will see only perfection and rejoice in it if we look at ourselves others and the world around us we will see only imperfection and be discontent\n depression comes from looking in the wrong place\n it is the bitter fruit of ego involvement of ego obsession\n the remedy is not to have high self esteem but rather to have god esteem\n and since we live in god we will see the divine side even of ourselves and be ever hopeful\n once god spoke to a contemporary mystic and said i am he who is\n you are she who is not\n now to the ego that may sound hateful but to the questing spirit it is a liberating assurance\n the unreal which we call me need not be struggled with it is only a ghost a shadow\n bringing in the light of god contact will reveal that to be the truth\n then we will be at peace and in perfect joy\n what a burden is lifted from those who come to know that god alone is real and true and that we need only look to him\n when we look within we find him as the heart of our selves\n we must renounce unreality\n as i say we are addicted to it so we will have to struggle to break the terrible habit of delusion just as those addicted to the hallucinations produced by drugs have to break away from them and discard them forever\n then we will rejoice in him\n desirelessness covet no man wealth\n why because it does not exist it is just a bubble destined to burst leaving nothing in its place\n there are no things to covet or possess\n they are the fever dreams of illusion from which we must awaken\n no one really owns anything firstly because the thing as we perceive it does not exist and the man does not exist either and neither do we as least so far as our perceptions of them it and me go\n god and i in space alone and nobody else in view\n and where are the people o lord i said\n the earth below and the sky o erhead and the dead whom once i knew that was a dream god smiled and said a dream that seemed to be true there were no people living or dead there was no earth and no sky o erhead there was only myself and you\n why do i feel no fear i asked meeting you here in this way for i have sinned i know full well and there is heaven and there is hell and is this the judgment day nay those were dreams the great god said dreams that have ceased to be\n there are no such things as fear or sin there is no you you have never beenthere is nothing at all but me\n living a life worth living how to live well may he be content to live a hundred years who acts wiyout attachment who works his work with earnestness but wiyout desire not yearning for its fruits he and he alone\n it is generally felt that this verse and other passages from scriptures and books on spiritual life indicates that one hundred years is the normal lifespan for a human being\n on the other hand the figure of one hundred years may also symbolize the complete lifespan of a person however brief or long the idea here being that not one moment of our life need be a burden nor should we ever wish to shorten our life by a single breath that life should be lived in fulfillment with peace and happiness all the way through\n that this is possible has been shown well by the saints and masters of all religions and ages\n we need only know how to do it and these words give the way\n acting wiyout attachment and desire in the bhagavad gita krishna draws very clearly for us the picture of a person who lives in anxiety and misery and him who lives in peace and contentment\n both may be living in exactly the same situation for it is not external conditions that make us happy or miserable but our reaction to them\n krishna makes it quite plain that the secret of happiness or misery lies in the absence of two things attachment and desire\n those who live in attachment to externalities anxious to fulfill desire must suffer and live in frustration\n on the other hand those who live wiyout egoic desire are perpetually at peace\n nonattachment krishna not only holds out the ideal for us he also tells us how to accomplish it\n perform every action with your heart fixed on the supreme lord\n renounce attachment to the fruits\n be even tempered in success and failure for it is this evenness of temper which is meant by yoga\n in the calm of self surrender you can free yourself from the bondage of virtue and vice during this very life\n devote yourself therefore to reaching union with brahman\n to unite the heart with brahman and then to act that is the secret of non attached work\n when your intellect has cleared itself of its delusions you will become indifferent to the results of all action present or future\n the world is imprisoned in its own activity except when actions are performed as worship of god\n therefore you must perform every action sacramentally and be free from all attachments to results\n whosoever works for me alone makes me his only goal and is devoted to me free from attachment and wiyout hatred toward any creature that man o prince shall enter into me\n therefore a man should contemplate brahman until he has sharpened the axe of his non attachment\n with this axe he must cut through the firmly rooted aswattha tree\n no human being can give up action altogether but he who gives up the fruits of action is said to be non attached\n when a man has achieved non attachment self mastery and freedom from desire through renunciation he reaches union with brahman who is beyond all action\n in other words keeping the mind on god frees us from egoic attachment to our activities\n this is an extremely high ideal and one very hard to attain yet we must strive for it through the practice of meditation for only the clarity of vision reached through meditation can enable us to live out such a lofty ideal\n working with earnestness lest we think that negative or passive indifference is detachment or that carelessness and shoddiness in our daily work is spiritual mindedness a view that prevails in much of the orient and among many in the west the upanishad plainly tells us that the wise man works his work with earnestness\n this is really a great portion of the bhagavad gita s message that we must work with skill to the best of our abilities that is our part while leaving the results to god that is his part\n in that way we truly are workers together with god in our life\n sri ramakrishna said if you can weigh salt you can weigh sugar meaning that if a person is proficient in spiritual life he will be proficient in his outer life as well\n that does not mean that all yogis need to become great successes in business or some other profession but it does mean that they need to work with the full capabilities they possess and do absolutely the best they can and no more that is they need not worry about the results\n in this way they will be at peace both internally and externally\n wiyout desire the real cankerworm in the garden of our life is desire whether in the form of wanting wishing yearning desiring hoping demanding or craving\n whether to a little or a great degree desire destroys our hearts and our chances for inner peace\n desire is a wasting fever which drives us onward to spiritual loss\n for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul as wordsworth wrote we have given our hearts away a sordid boon i have spent my entire life watching people gain a little bit of the world and lose their souls\n and ultimately they lost the world too either in the changes of earthly fortune or through the finality of death\n and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a man s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth\n and he speak a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he yought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods\n and i will say to my soul soul you hast much goods laid up for many years take yours ease eat drink and be merry\n but god said unto him thou fool this night your soul shall be required of you then whose shall those things be which you hast provided so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god\n desirelessness is not a zombie like passivity a kind of pious vegetating\n krishna lauds the desireless in these words he knows bliss in the atman and wants nothing else\n cravings torment the heart he renounces cravings\n i call him illumined\n not shaken by adversity not hankering after happiness free from fear free from anger free from the things of desire\n i call him a seer and illumined\n the bonds of his flesh are broken\n he is lucky and does not rejoice he is unlucky and does not weep i call him illumined\n the tortoise can draw in its legs the seer can draw in his senses\n i call him illumined\n the abstinent run away from what they desire but carry their desires with them when a man enters reality he leaves his desires behind him\n the desireless who have fulfilled themselves in god are the most alive happy and sait isfied of beings\n surely they and they alone are content to live a hundred years\n for them there is no talk of death being a blessed release which it is not for they are already freed in spirit\n spiritual suicides worlds there are wiyout suns covered up with darkness\n to these after death go the ignorant slayers of the self\n verily those worlds of the asuras are enveloped in blind darkness and thereto they all repair after death who are slayers of atman\n this is the translation of swami nikhilananda\n the upanishadic seer opens by speaking of the way of fulfilled and joyful life seeing the divine in all things and living on the earth according to divine law\n but this is not the only world in which we can find ourself as we move through a cycle of continuous birth and death birth into one world after having died out of another or another birth into the world where we were just living\n when we speak of birth we usually think only of physical embodiment on this earth\n but when we die in this world we are born into an astral world where we remain for some time and then die to that world and become born back into this world\n alyough this world remains virtually the same despite the fact that every generation thinks it is a great advance over previous eras we can spend time in a vast array of astral worlds positive and negative pleasant and unpleasant\n the earth becomes a kind of stable place of return for us\n or is it many births many worlds alyough the earth accommodates a wide range of spiritual and psychological evolution the astral worlds are more specialized\n there is an astral world for every degree of consciousness\n these worlds can be classified just as sentient beings are classified\n that does not say much since each person can have a different set of criteria for such classification\n but the masters of wisdom have generally agreed there are two basic kinds of people suras and asuras those who dwell in the light and those who live in the dark\n divine and demonic are commonly used to translate sura or deva and asura\n a sura deva is in the light an asura is not\n sometimes a person dwells in the dark by choice but most often it is a state of ignorance rather than negative volition\n because of this we need to avoid a deva is good asura is bad reaction in all cases yough there are instances when this is accurate and to repress it would be foolish and asuric the sixteenth chapter of the bhagavad gita practically speaking however that is looking at the result of manifesting those natures it is just that simple\n an entire chapter of the bhagavad gita is directed to this manner of divine devic and demonic asuric nature as it manifests in human beings\n i know it is pretty lengyour but it is so insightful and complete that it merits inclusion here\n sri krishna speaks a man who is born with tendencies toward the divine is fearless and pure in heart\n he perseveres in that path to union with brahman which the scriptures and his teacher have taught him\n he can control his passions\n he studies the scriptures regularly and obeys their directions\n he practices spiritual disciplines\n he is straightforward truthful and of an even temper\n he harms no one\n he renounces the things of this world\n he has a tranquil mind and an unmalicious tongue\n he is compassionate toward all\n he is not greedy\n he is gentle and modest\n he abstains from useless activity\n he has faith in the strength of his higher nature\n he can forgive and endure\n he is clean in yought and act\n he is free from hatred and from pride\n such qualities are his birthright\n when a man is born with demonic tendencies his birthright is hypocrisy arrogance conceit anger cruelty and ignorance\n the birthright of the divine nature leads to liberation\n the birthright of the demonic nature leads to greater bondage\n but you need not fear arjuna your birthright is divine\n in this world there are two kinds of beings those whose nature tends toward the divine and those who have the demonic tendencies\n i have already described the divine nature to you in some detail\n now you shall learn more about the demonic nature\n men of demonic nature know neither what they ought to do nor what they should refrain from doing\n there is no truth in them or purity or right conduct\n they maintain that the scriptures are a lie and that the universe is not based upon a moral law but godless conceived in lust and created by copulation wiyout any other cause\n because they believe this in the darkness of their little minds these degraded creatures do horrible deeds attempting to destroy the world\n they are enemies of mankind\n their lust can never be appeased\n they are arrogant and vain and drunk with pride\n they run blindly after what is evil\n the ends they work for are unclean\n they are sure that life has only one purpose gratification of the senses\n and so they are plagued by innumerable cares from which death alone can release them\n anxiety binds them with a hundred chains delivering them over to lust and wrath\n they are ceaselessly busy piling up dishonest gains to sait isfy their cravings\n i wanted this and today i got it\n i want that i shall get it tomorrow\n all these riches are now mine soon i shall have more\n i have killed this enemy\n i will kill all the rest\n i am a ruler of men\n i enjoy the things of this world\n i am successful strong and happy\n who is my equal i am so wealyour and so nobly born\n i will sacrifice to the gods\n i will give alms\n i will make merry\n that is what they say to themselves in the blindness of their ignorance\n they are addicts of sensual pleasure made restless by their many desires and caught in the net of delusion\n they fall into the filyour hell of their own evil minds\n conceited haughty foolishly proud and intoxicated by their wealth they offer sacrifice to god in name only for outward show wiyout following the sacred rituals\n these malignant creatures are full of egoism vanity lust wrath and consciousness of power\n they loathe me and deny my presence both in themselves and in others\n they are enemies of all men and of myself cruel despicable and vile\n i cast them back again and again into the wombs of degraded parents subjecting them to the wheel of birth and death\n and so they are constantly reborn in degradation and delusion\n they do not reach me but sink down to the lowest possible condition of the soul\n am i an asura what are the basic traits that render someone an asura the upanishad has already given them spiritual blindness spiritual darkness spiritual ignorance and engaging in deeds that kill the awareness and the freedom of the eternal immortal divine self\n the first three are what dispose us to the fourth destructive trait\n krishna has already given us quite an exposition of the ways of the asuric personality but it can all be summed up in their effect the negation of consciousness of the individual spirit\n now this point that spiritual ignorance is a matter of unawareness of the individual spirit our own atman is particularly important because many asuras think to hide their status under an externalized cloak of religiosity of supposed belief in and dedication to god\n but this is all nonsense\n saint john the apostle comments that no one can legitimately claim to love god whom they have not seen if they have no love for their fellow human beings whom they have seen\n in the same way it is absurd to pretend that we know or are aware of the infinite spirit when we are not aware of the finite spirit our own self which is right within us\n this is why buddha simply refused to speak about god or gods and insisted that each one must seek for nirvana alone rejecting all other matters as harmful distractions\n another upanishad states that if we learn about water from a single cup of water we can then know about oceans of water\n in the same way if we come to truly comprehend our nature as spirit we will be able to know god the infinite spirit\n thus self knowledge knowledge of our spirit is essential\n shankara says that until we know the self we are all asuras in the absolute sense but if we are seeking to know the self i expect the distinction is not so drastic\n an asura then is one whose life and yought obscure and darken the inner consciousness so the true self remains unknown and buried often even unsuspected as to its existence\n it has nothing to do with what philosophers and theologians say about it the matter is thoroughly pragmatic\n do we or don t we are we or aren t we verbal claims mean nothing here\n state of being alone matters\n the worlds of the asuras because it is their will asuras are born over and over in worlds enveloped in blind darkness at the time of their death earthly or astral\n naturally our youghts go to the ideas of hell so beloved to all religionists east and west whether it is the absurdly simplistic fire pit of christianity or the horrifically complex and lurid hell s of hinduism taoism or buddhism\n but what is this world in which we presently find ourselves a world ravaged with hatred violence disease cruelty and aggressive ignorance and greed the fact that there is also kindness love mercy and toleration in the world makes it even more crazy schizophrenic and schizophrenogenic making us crazy \n no wonder the onion a satirical magazine ran an article entitled god diagnosed with bipolar disorder\n it might seem blasphemous but it is the preposterous religion prevailing in the west that is blasphemous and the satire is just pointing it out\n someone once asked paramhansa yogananda if he believed in hell\n paramhansaji smiled and asked where do you think you are a very good question indeed\n we write our own ticket by the way we think and act\n no amount of rationalization or assurance from others will change this fact\n if we seek darkness we will find darkness if we seek the light we will find the light\n nothing more nothing less\n ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened\n just be aware of the consequences\n the undivided unmoving self the teachings of the upanishads are the supreme expressions of the eternal wisdom the eternal vision of the vedic seers\n consequently yough simple in their mode of expression they can be extremely hard to grasp\n the rishis lived in a state of consciousness almost opposite to that of most of us\n but it is possible of attainment and so the wise cultivate it\n yet we need guidance along the way and need to carefully look into the upanishadic dicta for that guidance\n there are many things that we need not know but the truths embodied in the upanishads and their inspired summary the bhagavad gita must be known by all who would ascend to higher life\n so they merit our intent consideration\n the four levels of understanding during the last week of his earthly life jesus was in jerusalem at the passover season\n at one point while speaking to the crowd he prayed father glorify your name\n then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again\n the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel speak to him\n and of course a third contingency heard nothing\n this is how it is in this world of unreality when reality impinges on it\n according to the level of development so the encountering individual reacts to the impingement\n in indian philosophy there are a lot of numerical divisions but one of the most prevalent is that of four\n to list some there are four ages yugas of human history there are four modes of consciousness waking dreaming dreamless sleep and turiya consciousness itself there are four stages of dharmic life student family semi solitary and monastic and of course there are four castes shudra vaishya kshatriya and brahmain \n all of these relate to the evolutionary development of the individual as krishna says guna and karma and are fundamentally a matter of internal disposition and capacity\n these four levels is it an accident there are four gospels are depicted in this event\n some people heard what was spoken and knew it was the voice of god some heard a voice not the actual words and yought it was an angel speaking some heard an indistinct sound and yought it was thunder and others no doubt the majority heard nothing at all\n it is not an event that matters as much as our comprehension of it\n yes that is everything comprehension\n and that takes place only according to our state of inner development\n krishna spoke of this in the beginning of his instruction to arjuna at kurukshetra saying there are some who have actually looked upon the atman and understood it in all its wonder\n others can only speak of it as wonderful beyond their understanding\n others know of its wonder by hearsay\n and there are others who are told about it and do not understand a word\n here again are the four levels of comprehension\n we pass from one to another in ascending steps only through inner cultivation in other words only through meditation but meditation supported by a entire way of life that facilitates it in other words dharma\n for if there is neither the practice nor the support for the practice little will result in the way of developing consciousness\n and if consciousness is not developed the teachings of the great sages will be little understood by us and perhaps greatly misunderstood or just not understood at all\n sri ramakrishna told about a certain group of yogis who were wont to challenge a person with the words what station are you dwelling in by station they meant the habitual state of the individual s mind\n the next verse of the isha upanishad is not easy to grasp because it speaks of a mode of being far different from our usual condition\n so it will be a real test as to what station of consciousness we are dwelling in as we try to decode it\n here it is the self is one\n unmoving it moves swifter than yought\n the senses do not overtake it for always it goes before\n remaining still it outstrips all that run\n wiyout the self there is no life\n the self is one one has two meanings in eastern yought number and quality\n this a very important point since many controversies have arisen philosophically simply because western thinkers tend to limit one to a numerical value only\n the incredibly bitter and violent controversy over the so called monophysite heresy in early christianity in which tens of yousands of egyptians and syrians were killed by the armies of the byzantine empire took place only because the italian byzantines could not grasp what the heretics meant by the simple word monos when applied to spiritual matters\n both meanings number and quality have significance for us who like the four kumaras are intent on the knowing of the self\n the principle that the self is one should set us to thinking about our own present self concept and perhaps even more important the way we live out our self concept\n many people think one thing intellectually or at least verbally for public consumption and think another instinctively\n for example i knew a minister who was once challenged by a self styled atheist who spent about an hour expounding the truth of atheism and the folly of theism\n when he was finished the minister said there are two points about all that you have just said\n one it is complete nonsense\n two you do not believe a word of it yourself\n the man threw his right hand up in the air and declaimed i swear to god in heaven that i do somewhere i have already mentioned that an eastern christian theological student once remarked to me that the worse thing that had ever happened to western christianity and western philosophy in general was the invention of the pie chart those round diagrams divided into slices that plagued us throughout school in many subjects from mathematics to sociology\n people have come to think that they are conglomerations of pieces that make up a whole rather than a single homogenous being he explained\n how many times do people speak of having several roles in life or of wearing many hats\n fragmentation is a terrible plague destroying our capacity to either see or attain unityintegration of our being\n we think it is all right to be multiple persons\n where this all began with us is buried in the past but the present reality cannot be denied\n drawn out from our center of unity we say i am a businessman a spouse a parent a citizen etc\n rather than i am a single person who functions in the area of business marriage parenthood citizenship etc\n this no small thing and certainly not merely a philosophical nicety\n this is a serious mental and spiritual disorder\n being both fragmented and dispersed in our energies and awareness rather than operating from a central point of order the mirror of our life is shattered into innumerable fragments that cannot convey any coherent image of our face\n the unity that is the true image is defaced effaced and even erased as far as our consciousness is concerned even yough our true nature can never be altered in any manner\n struggling and submerged in the illusion of multiplicity the truth of our unity is far from us\n for we are not just one numerically we are absolutely one in nature\n this is an eternal truth that must be regained by us\n how to do so by the only process that really unifies the consciousness meditation\n unmoving it moves swifter than yought how can the self move swifter than yought and yet be unmoving this is not some koan like platitude meant to faze our mind in relation to self knowledge it is simple fact\n the self the spirit is completely outside of time and space which are illusions anyway yet it can scan time and space moving backward and forward simply because of the fact that it is one\n being one in the truest sense the self is everywhere since there really is no where at all\n the self is truly whole and therefore all embracing\n it moves swifter than yought because a yought requires a time however small to arise or be expressed\n the self in contrast exists only in the now\n the questions where did i come from where am i going what was i in the past and what shall i be in the future are valuable because they set us on the quest to the discovery that we do not come or go nor do we have a past or future only a present\n when sri ramana maharshi was at the end of his physical embodiment he commented they say i am going but where shall i go some years later sri anandamayi ma visited ramanashram\n when the maharshi s disciples asked her to stay there feeling that in her they had refound their guru she simply remarked i neither come nor go\n this is true of us as well\n the senses do not overtake it for always it goes before the self does not move but it is always before the questing senses in the sense that it is always out of their reach\n the mandukya upanishad speaking of the consciousness of the self of turiya describes it as not subjective experience nor objective experience nor experience intermediate between these two nor is it a negative condition which is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness\n it is not the knowledge of the senses nor is it relative knowledge nor yet inferential knowledge\n beyond the senses beyond the understanding beyond all expression it is pure unitary consciousness wherein awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely obliterated\n it is ineffable peace\n it is the supreme good\n it is one wiyout a second\n it is the self\n know it alone who can say any more remaining still it outstrips all that run the self is unmoving as we have been told\n hence any movement is incompatible with it and blots it from our awareness\n that which moves cannot possibly perceive it nor can any process of movement including the labyrinyours ways of so much yoga ever result in touching or seeing it\n rather movement must cease as patanjali points out in the very beginning of the yoga sutras yoga is the cessation of movement in the mind substance\n in other words when we stop running we will rest in our self\n wiyout the self there is no life this is perhaps the hardest lesson for human beings to learn wiyout the self there is no life\n we may engage in frantic activity running here and there and accomplishing tremendous things indulging the senses to the maximum and immersing ourselves in ambitions emotions and relationships but through it all the truth is simply this we are dead mere wraiths feeding desperately on a shadow life that is no life at all not even a poor imitation\n in the self alone do we find life\n how hard this is to learn and how much harder it is to follow through on for it inevitably leads to the total renunciation of all that is not the self in other words to the renunciation of everything we hold dear and identify with as being ours and our self when they are no such thing at all\n this is a bitter insight in the beginning but as our inner eye begins to adjust to the truth of it we find it the source of greatest joy\n who knows the atman knows that happiness born of pure knowledge the joy of sattwa\n deep his delight after strict self schooling sour toil at first but at last what sweetness the end of sorrow\n he knows bliss in the atman and wants nothing else\n cravings torment the heart he renounces cravings\n i call him illumined\n not shaken by adversity not hankering after happiness free from fear free from anger free from the things of desire\n i call him a seer and illumined\n the recollected mind is awake in the knowledge of the atman which is dark night to the ignorant the ignorant are awake in their sense life which they think is daylight to the seer it is darkness\n this is the state of enlightenment in brahman a man does not fall back from it into delusion\n even at the moment of death he is alive in that enlightenment brahman and he are one\n so with his heart serene and fearless firm in the vow of renunciation holding the mind from its restless roaming now let him struggle to reach my oneness ever absorbed his eyes on me always his prize his purpose\n when a man has achieved non attachment self mastery and freedom from desire through renunciation he reaches union with brahman who is beyond all action\n a great deal is involved when we sincerely pray lead me from death to immortality\n the ever present self to the ignorant the self appears to move yet it moves not\n from the ignorant it is far distant yet it is near\n it is within all and it is wiyout all\n the self appears to move yet it moves not we have just covered the fact that being outside of the illusions of time and space the self neither moves nor goes through any type of change whatsoever\n yet it experiences a multiplicity of externalities as the unmoving witness momentarily caught up in the movie and thinking it is inside it and undergoing the changes in the scenario\n just as imagining seeing or doing something is not the same as seeing or doing it so observing the motion picture of countless lives with their attendant joys and sorrows is not the same as actually being born living and dying over and over\n but we are deluded into thinking so and the upanishadic sage is endeavoring to wake us up just as we awaken someone who is having a nightmare and calling out in pain or fear\n we however having become accustomed even addicted to the nightmare are a lot more difficult to awaken\n it is far distant yet it is near since the self is existing in eternity transcending any degree of relativity it could not be further away from the relative realm of experience not existence because the relative does not actually exist at all except as an illusion \n on the other hand since relativity is only a concept the self is the nearest possible because it alone is actually present at the end of the syrian jacobite liturgy the celebrant gives a blessing beginning you who are far and you who are near \n the reference is not to those who are at the back of the church and those who are at the front but to those who are far and near in their minds and hearts\n for those who are immersed in the illusion of relativity nothing could be further away than the transcendent self\n yet since as i have said the self alone is ever present it is nearer than any relative experiencing\n it is as the kena upanishad says the ear of the ear mind of the mind speech of speech\n also breath of the breath and eye of the eye\n it is within all and it is wiyout all nothing can exist apart from the self even an illusion\n a hallucination is a thing even yough it is solely mental\n the self is the substratum upon and within which everything subsists the screen on which the light and shadow play of life is projected\n it is itself the basis of all that is perceived\n from one perspective it can be said that the self consciousness is inside everything\n from another since it is forever separate from all things it can be spoken of as outside alien to all things\n whichever way you say it the idea is the same the self never touches any thing\n the effect of seeing true he who sees all beings in the self and the self in all beings hates none\n here we come to the practical application of what the upanishad is telling us about the self\n this is the inestimable value of the bhagavad gita\n where the upanishads express spiritual mathematics in a usually abstract manner the gita outlines both the upanishadic principles and what the result will be when they are followed or realized defining spiritual realities in practical observable terms\n if we never lose sight of the self then we will be able to perceive what is not the self\n and since what is not the self is not even real why would we hate it conversely how could we hate or be averse to the real self this vision is the foundation of dynamic even mindedness\n it is also the absolute end of all delusion and negative reaction to it for the upanishad concludes to the illumined soul the self is all\n for him who sees everywhere oneness how can there be delusion or grief the all embracing self where one sees nothing but the one hears nothing but the one knows nothing but the one there is the infinite\n where one sees another hears another knows another there is the finite\n the infinite is immortal the finite is mortal\n to the illumined soul the self is all\n for him who sees everywhere oneness how can there be delusion or grief the self is everywhere\n bright is he bodiless wiyout scar of imperfection wiyout bone wiyout flesh pure untouched by evil\n the seer the thinker the one who is above all the self existent he it is that has established perfect order among objects and beings from beginningless time\n the self is everywhere being outside of time and space the self is both everywhere and nowhere depending on one s point of reference\n one thing is definite the self cannot be separated from to any degree and is always present in the fullest measure\n this being so we need not seek the self but only realize it\n we are always seeing touching and living in the self yet we do not recognize it just as fish have no perception of water because of its intimate and integral connection with them\n the self is even more immediate to us than is water to the fish\n the most practical application of this truth is simple we should always we aware of the self and centered in the self\n and that is done by the continual meditation and japa of om\n meditate on om as the self\n the self atman is of the nature of the syllable om\n thus the syllable om is the very self\n he who knows it thus enters the self supreme spirit with his self individual spirit \n directly realize the self by meditating on om\n the syllable om is the self\n earnest seekers who incessantly and with a steady mind repeat om will attain success\n by repetition of the pure om the mind is withdrawn from sense objects and becomes one with the self\n bright is he in the katha upanishad it is said of the self him the sun does not illumine nor the moon nor the stars nor the lightning nor verily fires kindled upon the earth\n he is the one light that gives light to all\n he shining everything shines\n the self is illumined by no external light but rather illumines all itself\n we could shine the brightest of lights into the eyes of a dead man and he would see nothing\n but if the self is present to enliven him then he will\n the self is known seen by the self and therefore it is called swayamprakash self illumined\n hence only those in contact with their self can be said to possess illumination to any degree\n those who under the banner of devotion obsess on external practices and deities can only dwell in the light that is darkness\n we must seek illumination in the self alone keeping in mind that god is the self of the self that to seek one is to seek the other\n sukram the word translated bright also means pure in the sense of being of such perfect clarity that no light is obscured\n for it is from the core of the self that the pure light of god shines forth\n therefore as just pointed out to attain self knowledge is to realize both the atman and the paramatman\n only when we are centered in our self can we see god and only when we are centered in god can we truly know our self\n in a flawless crystal what do we see nothing\n so also in the self there is nothing seen for all things are transcended and pure being alone remains in our consciousness\n wherefore the chandogya upanishad tells us where one sees nothing but the one hears nothing but the one knows nothing but the one there is the infinite\n where one sees another hears another knows another there is the finite\n the infinite is immortal the finite is mortal\n bodiless obviously the self is not material but it is necessary for us to further realize that the self never touches materiality that in never has a body in the sense that it is integrated with a body and either affects it or is affected by it\n this is extremely important for religion and a lot of yoga usually leads us astray by getting us to be involved in a multitude of activities that including intellectual study and conceptualizations are taking place only in the various bodies koshas and therefore have nothing whatsoever to do with the self and hence are usually irrelevant\n it is true that we need to purify and refine the bodies so they will cease to veil or obscure the self but we should understand that the entire process takes place outside the self and never affects the self to any degree\n it is also necessary to comprehend that the self is not really in the body ies at all for by its very nature it cannot be encompassed or contained by anything including the body\n they are contained in me but i am not in them says krishna\n and the same is true of our own self\n to realize the self we must disengage our awareness totally from the bodies alyough in the practice of meditation we use the bodies as stepping stones to approach the self and eventually transcend them altogether\n so we need not reject the bodies simply have the correct perspective regarding them\n wiyout scar of imperfection imperfection can occur only in the level of relativity\n being eternally outside of relative existence it is not possible for the self to ever be marked for either good or bad neither of which even exists for the self\n in yoga sutra patanjali describes the supreme lord saying ishwara is a distinct spirit untouched by troubles actions and their results and latent impressions\n the relevant idea here is that god is beyond all action and therefore incapable of either incurring karma or of being conditioned or affected in any way by action since he never acts\n exactly the same is true of the self\n wiyout bone wiyout flesh obviously the self has no body that has already been said so why this statement about the self being wiyout bone or flesh the idea being presented is that the self has no inner or outer\n it has no essence as a substratum or framework skeleton which can become the ground or basis of another external entity that is an extension of mutation of itself\n the self has neither parts nor appendages upadhis \n it is thoroughly homogenous and absolutely one\n it cannot be more itself or less itself\n there are no gradations or shadings in the self\n pure we have already considered the purity of the self and need only add one more point the self is also pure because there is nothing intervening between the self and anything else including god\n it is absolute and direct wiyout admixture of any kind\n untouched by evil obviously the self is untouched by evil for it is not touched affected by anything at all or at any time\n the seer the unwitnessed witness is the self\n in truth there is no other witness on the individual level because the senses mind and intellect are mere energy constructs that have no consciousness of their own\n the eye never really sees nor does the ear hear\n no more does the brain or intellect\n rather the spirit that is consciousness witnesses their messages therefore the upanishadic seer said the self is ear of the ear mind of the mind speech of speech\n he is also breath of the breath and eye of the eye\n having given up the false identification of the self with the senses and the mind and knowing the self to be brahman the wise on departing this life become immortal\n and of brahman it was said he who knows brahman to be the life of life the eye of the eye the ear of the ear the mind of the mind he indeed comprehends fully the cause of all causes\n regarding the self and the self of the self krishna stated watching over the ear and the eye and presiding there behind touch and taste and smell he is also within the mind he enjoys and suffers the things of the senses\n the thinker not being the brain only its witness and not its possessor the self is here called the thinker only as an attempt to convey the idea that it is the self that both witnesses and knows what it is witnessing\n it is not just a screen on which the motion picture of life is projected nor is it a consciousness of objects alone wiyout cognition of their nature\n an infant or an animal perceives exactly what an adult human being perceives but has no idea what it is perceiving or even that it perceives in many cases\n the self on the other hand does indeed know and comprehend what is presented to its view\n and because of its proximity the will and intellect respond to the stimuli mirroring the consciousness that is the self\n consequently they are often mistaken for the self or wrongly supposed to have a consciousness and intelligence of their own\n the one who is above all there is nothing higher than the self nothing beyond the self\n what about god god and the self being one even god should not be yought of as beyond or above it\n further brahman is not a thing in a hierarchal chain of being that it could possibly be said to be above or below any thing whatsoever\n this statement is extremely practical for it is impossible to conduct a spiritual life wiyout the correct perspective the spirit is supreme\n not only is everything lesser that the spirit in truth everything else is nothing in comparison\n those who do not hold this conviction really have no spiritual life in the truest sense\n this is the only correct perspective\n devotees seek to know him by study by sacrifice by continence by austerity by detachment\n to know him is to become a seer\n desiring to know him and him alone monks renounce the world\n realizing the glory of the self the sages of old craved not sons nor daughters\n what have we to do with sons and daughters they asked we who have known the self we who have achieved the supreme goal of existence no longer desiring progeny nor wealth nor life in other worlds they entered upon the path of complete renunciation\n the self existent the spirit never had a beginning\n again this does not mean that the atman is separate from brahman or in any way independent of brahman\n brahman being self existent and eternal so also is the self\n it is necessary for us to realize that nothing conditions or really affects the self that it is absolutely independent of all objects places or conditions\n otherwise we fall into the labyrinth of confusion and false identities he it is that has established perfect order among objects and beings from beginningless time once again the unity identity of the individual self and the supreme self cause the upanishadic rishi to make a statement that applies to both alyough we are used to thinking only in terms of the absolute self\n really hardly any of us being conditioned by western religion actually believe that there is perfect order among objects and beings from beginningless time or at the present moment\n this reminds me of an incident in the life of sri ma anandamayi\n one of those ever present i am going to make the world a better place types once remarked to her that he wanted to attain realization so he could work to make the world a perfect entity\n mother instantly replied who do you think that it is not perfect right now and of course it is\n it is a mess because we are entities that at the moment need to work our way through a mess when we come to the point where order is what we need we will be transferred to an orderly world\n this one will remain as it is for those students of life who also need to find themselves in the midst of a mess\n the world is a mirror of our mind\n we may like to be pharisees who think we are not as those around us but we are\n everything we see in this world is in our mind to some degree otherwise we would not be here\n if we do not like what we see then we should change ourselves\n there is no other remedy and there certainly is no escape from the necessity for change\n so it is we ourselves that have brought us into this world and provided for ourselves everything we need to evolve through reacting to and solving the problems set before us\n a person who whines and pities himself does not learn and therefore is continually faced with the same situations\n have you ever known the kind of person that perpetually complains about being let down by others or those that have a list of people or situations that hurt or cheated them they are simply slow learners that deserve no pity for they are doing it all to themselves\n every day theravada buddhists monks recite verses of wisdom some of which say i have nothing but my actions i shall never have anything but my actions\n being lazy cowardly and egoit istical we hate these truths\n but they are the truth and until we face them we will keep on whirling and whining blaming god the universe and everybody else but the real culprit ourselves\n note i say ourselves not our selves\n cosmic destiny is determined by each one of us\n god simply has nothing to do with it except for providing us the environment in which we can work out our will\n we can see from this that a lot of petitionary prayer and surrender to the divine will is idiotic and gets us nowhere\n the day we start taking full and exclusive responsibility for our past present and future is the day we will begin moving toward real perfection\n perspective on life the full purna picture to darkness are they doomed who devote themselves only to life in the world and to a greater darkness they who devote themselves only to meditation\n life in the world alone leads to one result meditation alone leads to another\n so have we heard from the wise\n they who devote themselves both to life in the world and to meditation by life in the world overcome death and by meditation achieve immortality\n wise teachers have pointed out that even yough non duality is the actual state of things in our present condition of being netted in maya we need to know that all is one but live as yough duality is also real\n the world may not be ultimately real but we need to work through the puzzles presented to us by relative experience\n two serious errors can be committed by the youghtful aspirant the conclusion that since none of it is real nothing really matters and there is no need for spiritual endeavor and the conclusion that since only the spiritual is real we should ignore the external and the material aspects of life and put all our attention on the inner spiritual side of life\n but right there the error is uncovered for the spiritual is only a side of life as is the material and together they make the two sided whole\n or we can look at it in an even better and truer way the material is the spiritual and therefore demands and deserves our full attention as well as the obviously spiritual aspects of life\n this is the meaning of the vedic verse beginning purnamadah purnamidam that is the full this is the full\n the full has come out of the full\n if we take the full from the full it is the full that yet remains\n the two are really and always the one\n to reject or turn from one is to reject and turn from the all\n it cannot be wiyout meaning that the bases of sanatana dharma the vedas the upanishads and the brahma sutras were written by sages who lived fully in the world with families and their attendant responsibilities including that of making a livelihood\n of course it was the satya yuga then and earthly life was very different from life in our present age\n nevertheless those who like to excuse themselves from striving for self realization by citing their involvement in the world and worldly responsibilities should consider the historical facts\n and anyway where exactly do they think the monastics are living from darkness to greater darkness to darkness are they doomed who devote themselves only to life in the world and to a greater darkness they who devote themselves only to meditation\n the purna the full it also means the complete is one yet it is dual\n this makes no sense but considering the limitation of our intellects that should be no surprise\n it is our intuition that must come into function when we begin dealing with these higher spheres of reality\n we too are dual being image replicas of the divine archetype\n just as god is both relative and absolute both immanent and transcendent so are we on a miniature scale\n we too then must learn to function fully in both spheres for since they are essentially one if we do not so function we will be partial incomplete and therefore faulty rather than perfect which originally meant to be complete rather than wiyout fault\n be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect\n one of the fundamental errors of dualistic religion christianity in particular is its setting of the material against the spiritual and thereby insisting that the material must be rejected and the spiritual alone embraced\n this produces deep spiritual psychosis for it is simply impossible to do and also involves a rejection of an eternal part of ourselves and god \n sanatana dharma in contrast makes it clear that the two are really one and must both be cultivated according to the principles of dharma of course for us to attain the consciousness of perfect unity in ourselves and in god\n those who devote themselves only to life in the world become sunk in the limitations of materiality and addicted to its vagaries\n egoism and intense selfishness and exploitation of both the world and those living in it with us can be the sole result of such a limited focus\n having only a perspective of mortality the higher nature of the individual is suppressed to give free rein to the dog eat dog everyman for himself attitude that must arise from preoccupation with external existence\n having no idea of the true nature of either the world ourselves or our fellow human beings only chaos and destruction can come to us\n on the other hand those who devote themselves only to meditation or abstract philosophizing to the exclusion of material considerations and practical living come to a worse result complete psychological disintegration literally and alienation from any form of reality\n hypocrisy also results because to even eat and drink is to admit the necessity of physicality and that food must come from somewhere so dependence on the ignorant and astray becomes necessary\n it reminds me of a cartoon i saw years ago in an emigre russian newspaper just after the united states had supplied the soviet union with incredibly huge amounts of grain and saved their economy and the life of millions\n two old ladies were sweeping the street in red square\n one was saying to the other it is good we did not kill all the capitalists otherwise we would have starved to death\n how can a person justify living off those whose earthly involvement they despise and condemn the bhagavad gita discusses this matter thoroughly and points out the folly of the spirituals who pretend to have transcended worldly concerns\n we must function in both matter and spirit\n both elements must be integrated through the following of dharma to complete the picture and solve the evolutionary puzzle\n the material must be spiritualized and the spiritual must be materialized in the sense of making both practical and beneficial to one another\n in this endeavor the teachings of the bhagavad gita are indispensable for life in the world alone leads to one result meditation alone leads to another\n so have we heard from the wise\n from death to immortality they who devote themselves both to life in the world and to meditation by life in the world overcome death and by meditation achieve immortality\n life is not just some maze to be somehow gotten through or a monopoly board with random advances and regressions and there is certainly no get out of jail free rather life demands the fullest exercise of the two faculties that mark human beings out from the rest of earthly life forms developed reason and intuition\n intelligence of the highest order is necessary\n this does not mean that the aspirant needs to be an intellectual but he must be intelligent\n stupid people simply do not make it mostly because stupid people never seek it\n nor can the seeker s intelligence be kept on the shelf for only occasional use and amusement\n at all times the yogi must be keenly aware of what is going on in his life sphere and ever seeking to understand and work out the mystery\n as already said he needs highly developed intuition as well\n both these are only produced by meditation\n this is because both intelligence and intuition direct knowledge are divine attributes\n in the bhagavad gita krishna declares himself to be intelligence and the knowledge of the mystic \n in the katha upanishad brahman is said to be the intelligence of the intelligent and in the brihadaranyaka upanishad the sage gargya says the being who dwells in the heart as intelligence him i meditate upon as brahman\n i am not speaking of cunning or cleverness or savvy many stupid and most evil people possess them\n i am speaking of the intelligence which only arises in those who are of highly evolved consciousness\n it is those who possess right intelligence and right intuition that can live both the inner and outer lives simultaneously not first one and then the other in alternating cycles in a spiritually productive i\n by doing so they will accomplish two things\n one they will come to understand the real meaning and purpose of all they experience and do and thereby learn the lessons for which they came into relative existence\n two they will come to experience not just intellectually think that the two are really one manifestations of the one\n having seen the one in all they have attained immortality even in this mortal life\n notice that the upanishadic sage speak of being devoted to the outer and inner lives\n this means steadiness and regularity in practice as well as adamant adherence to the required disciplines such as yama and niyama\n but most important it means wanting even loving to lead the outer and inner lives according to the precepts of dharma\n there is no place here for grudging admittance of necessity of stingy eking out of the barest minimum that is required grumbling and resenting and wishing it need not be so\n such persons should not even try\n they are not just losers they are losses\n see the perspective of a christ crucifixion was the most horrible of deaths yet according to saint paul jesus for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame\n what a different perspective from the morbid and sentimental carryings on over the passion of jesus that christians engage in\n loving the world and the body that links them to the world nothing seems to them more painful or tragic than the torture and death of that idol\n but jesus hastened to the mockery the scourging and the crucifixion for the joy that was set before him\n not wonder he has been misunderstood and rejected through the ages by those who bear his name\n reinforcing the idea to darkness are they doomed who worship only the body and to greater darkness they who worship only the spirit\n worship of the body alone leads to one result worship of the spirit leads to another\n so have we heard from the wise\n they who worship both the body and the spirit by the body overcome death and by the spirit achieve immortality\n the basic idea of these verses has already been covered but we should notice the use of the word worship\n we are used to thinking of worship only in relation to god but it comes from an older form worthship which meant to acknowledge the value and significance of something\n therefore swami prabhavananda was wise in selecting this word for his translation\n the lesson here is the need to value both body and spirit\n i know that jesus said no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other but we are striving to be not men but gods so we are going to have to manage it\n and anyhow we are not interesting in serving the body or the spirit but in mastering them\n the body is the instrument of evolution so to despise and neglect it under the guise of spirituality is foolish\n any machine that malfunctions should be repaired not despised and tossed away the body included\n also hidden within the body are many doorways to higher consciousness\n therefore the body must be worked on to become the evolutionary device it is intended to be\n the first step is purification and that includes two major factors celibacy and vegetarian diet\n there is no getting around it\n just take a look at those who are not purifying themselves in these two ways and you will have proof enough\n all the rationalizing and mind gaming in the world cannot contravene the truth brahmaacharya continence and ahimsa non killing are absolute essentials for those who seek higher consciousness\n let us take a look at what the chandogya upanishad tells us about food\n food when eaten becomes threefold\n what is coarsest in it becomes faeces what is medium becomes flesh and what is subtlest becomes mind\n water when drunk becomes threefold\n what is coarsest in it becomes urine what is medium becomes blood and what is subtlest becomes prana\n the mind my dear consists of food the prana of water\n that my dear which is the subtlest part of curds rises when they are churned and becomes butter\n in the same manner my dear that which is the subtlest part of the food that is eaten rises and becomes mind\n the subtlest part of the water that is drunk rises and becomes prana\n thus my dear the mind consists of food the prana consists of water\n body and mind come from the food we eat\n thus our food must be both as pure as possible and also blessed by being offered to god\n and the conduct of the body must be as pure as possible and its deeds woryour of being offered to god\n action and yought determine the quality of body and mind\n ethics and good youghts are also essential but purity of body and mind is the crown jewel\n through these means both body and spirit are truly worshipped and immortality is gained\n seeing beyond the sun upanishadic tradition the final four verses of the isha upanishad are recited at the cremation of bodies in india and are a prayer for ascension to the higher realms that are beyond the compulsion of rebirth in this world\n these deal mainly with the sun\n throughout history and throughout the world the sun has been worshipped or considered a symbol of divinity\n the full comprehension of the spiritual nature of the sun was discovered in india untold ages ago and embodied in the upanishads\n light beyond the light the face of truth is hidden by your golden orb o sun\n that do you remove in order that i who am devoted to truth may behold its glory\n the sun illumines us and shows us what we assume to be reality\n but actually that seeing veils the truth reality behind that veil\n therefore we seek to pierce beyond it\n however the sun actually is that reality and we must approach it and petition for the removal of its outer light in order that we may behold its inner light\n more on this later\n the golden orb the golden orb has more than one meaning all of which are significant\n the most obvious meaning of the golden orb is the sun itself\n all plant animal and human life on this planet depend upon the sun\n it is the subtle powers of sunlight which stimulate growth and evolution\n sunlight particularly stimulates the activity of the higher centers in the brain especially that of the pineal gland\n even in the depths of the earth a sensitive man can tell when the sun rises and sets above him\n the sun appears to illuminate us but it is a light that covers the light in order to lead us to the light\n we must use it to go beyond it\n all things have an inner and outer life and that includes the sun\n we may say that there is the outer sun of the material universe and there is also the metaphysical sun of the psychic universe\n they operate simultaneously being the same thing\n the sun truly awakens us in the deepest sense\n as the germinating seed struggles upward toward the sun and out into its life giving rays so all higher forms of life reach out for the sun which acts as a metaphysical magnet drawing them upward and outward toward ever expanding consciousness\n the chandogya upanishad discusses it in this way even as a great extending highway runs between two villages this one and that yonder even so the rays of the sun go to both these worlds this one and that yonder\n they start from the yonder sun and enter into the nadis\n they start from the nadis and enter into the yonder sun\n when a man departs from this body then he goes upwards by these very rays or he goes up with the yought of om\n as his mind is failing he goes to the sun\n that verily is the gateway of the world an entering in for the knowers a shutting out for the non knowers\n the solar rays do not just flow into this world they also draw upward through the sun and beyond\n in the human body the process of exhalation and inhalation is related to solar energy and much of the solar power on which we subsist is drawn into the body through our breathing\n the solar rays do not just strike the surface of our body but actually penetrate into the physical nerves nadis \n the nadis are also the channels in the astral body that correspond to the physical nerves\n just as the electrical impulses flow through the physical nerves the subtle life force or prana flows through the subtle nadis and keeps us alive and functioning\n the prana then is a vehicle for the solar energies that produce evolution\n when the individual comes into manifestation on this earth he passes from the astral world into the material plane by means of the sun which is a mass of exploding astral energies not mere flaming gases\n and when the individual has completed his course of evolution within this plane upon the death of his body he rises upward in his subtle body and passes through the sun into the higher worlds there to evolve even higher or to pass directly into the depths of the transcendent brahman\n the golden orb is also the entire creation the means by which through experience the individual spirits can evolve to perfect conscious union with god\n wiyout it we would be unable to attain that union\n yet just as we use a ladder or stair to ascend and then step beyond it in the same way the creation is meant to be eventually transcended\n we must therefore keep both these aspects in mind while living in this world\n the golden orb is also our own mind that which perceives the world around us and the intelligence which comprehends what is going on and directs our lives accordingly\n potential is not enough there must be actualization\n it is our mind alone that can lead us beyond the mind our intelligence alone that can lead us onward to intuition\n at all stages the mind and intelligence are golden but if we allow ourselves to become stagnated at any point they rapidly tarnish and turn from beneficial to harmful\n immersed in this creation we are like the fish that must keep perpetually moving for they will die of suffocation if they come to a standstill\n if we do not move forward we shall move backward and often mistake it for progress\n we must get on and get beyond\n our own self atman is also the golden orb\n we must come to know our self our true self and delight in the self and wonder at its nature\n but that is not enough\n we must then pass onward to experience the self of our self the paramatman\n in a sense we transcend the self but of course we do not since the supreme self and our individual self are one\n this transcendence must ever be kept in mind for out of ignorance and even laziness a lot of people like the idea that we need only enter into the experience of our self and that is the end\n the same wrong headed view abrogates the need for our evolution and assumes that if we must smash the machine we will get the picture or even worse that there is no picture to see or even a seer to see it\n however cleverly this view may be worded or how sophisticated it appears it is nihilism of the deadliest sort a ruinous pitfall\n the golden orb is also the evolutionary impulse within all things which yough life itself to the evolving spirit yet urges us to continual transcendence of its various stages until we transcend it as well\n it is a golden stair that urges us onward to the heights where it cannot come\n the supreme sun the ultimate golden orb is the supreme self\n that is what we are striving toward by the five means just cited\n being transcendent how shall we reach it by means of its immanence within the world in the form of the sacred syllable om the pranava the life giver\n that which glows i\n the sun is om says the ancient aitareya brahmana \n the lifeproducing energies of the sun are the energies of om\n om is the sun of body mind and spirit the lifegiver of all\n all plant animal and human life on this planet depends upon the sun\n it is the subtle powers of sunlight which stimulate growth and evolution awakening us in the deepest sense\n sunlight is the radiant form of om\n the sun initiates the entire solar system into om\n human beings are solar creatures therefore to intone om is the most natural thing they can do\n now verily what is the udgitha is the om\n what is om is the udgitha\n and so verily the udgitha is the yonder sun and the om for the sun is continually sounding om\n the most significant part of this verse is the statement that the sun is continually sounding om indicating that the evolutionary energy of the sun is a manifestation of om\n our life depends on the light of the sun thus our life is also a manifestation of the power of om\n the japa and meditation of om aligns us with the solar powers that are om and thereby greatly increase our life force and the evolution of all the levels of our being\n even as a great extending highway runs between two villages this one and that yonder even so the rays of the sun go to both these worlds this one and that yonder\n they start from the yonder sun and enter into the nadis astral nerves \n they start from the nadis and enter into the yonder sun\n when a man departs from this body then he goes upwards by these very rays or he goes up with the yought of om\n as his mind is failing he goes to the sun\n that verily is the gateway of the world an entering in for the knowers a shutting out for the non knowers\n we have already cited this but there are more meanings for us to explore\n the prana the breath is a vehicle for the solar energies that produce evolution and so we join om to our breathing and merge it into the pranic flow\n this practice conditions our subtle levels so that at the time of death we will be oriented toward the solar powers and can ascend upon them especially if we continue our intonations of om even after the body has been dropped\n those intonations will guarantee our ascent into the solar world\n those who have imbued themselves with the pranavic vibrations will enter through the solar gate whereas those who have not done so will be shut out by it and compelled to return to earthly rebirth\n by means of om he the meditating yogi sees the way the way along which his prana goes therefore one should always repeat it so that he goes along the right way through the heart gate the air gate the gate which leads upward and the opening of the gate of liberation which is known as the open orb the sun\n those who continually invoke and meditate upon om during their lifetime will remember om at the time of death and by means of om will ascend to the sun and beyond into the real beyond\n it is said indeed the sun is this om therefore one should meditate and make himself ready to unite himself with it\n sunlight is the radiant form of om\n the sun initiates the entire solar system into om\n human beings are solar creatures therefore to intone om is the most natural things they can do\n at the time of departure from this world remember om the lord the protector says the yajur veda\n krishna states in the bhagavad gita at the hour of death when a man leaves his body he must depart with his consciousness absorbed in me\n then he will be united with me\n be certain of that\n whatever a man remembers at the last when he is leaving the body will be realized by him in the hereafter because that will be what his mind has most constantly dwelt on during this life\n therefore you must remember me at all times and do your duty\n if your mind and heart are set upon me constantly you will come to me\n make a habit of practicing meditation and do not let your mind be distracted\n in this way you will come finally to the lord who is the light giver the highest of the high\n whatever we think of most during life we will think of at the time of our death and that will determine our subsequent state\n those who continually invoke and meditate upon om during their lifetime will remember om at the time of death and by means of om will ascend to the sun and beyond into the real beyond\n qualified seers simply wanting a thing does not make it happen or come to us\n in the same way spiritual daydreaming is fruitless\n therefore he who petitions for the removal of the golden orb describes himself as i who am devoted to truth\n he is one who wishes to pass from the unreal to the real to no longer live in the magic of maya but to move onward to the reality behind all appearance\n and he does not just seek truth or think about it he is devoted to truth\n only those may behold its glory\n stop so i may go o nourisher only seer controller of all o illumining sun fountain of life for all creatures withhold your light gather together your rays\n may i behold through your grace your most blessed form\n the being that dwells therein even that being am i\n in indian philosophy god is often yought of as mother\n this verse bears that out speaking of the divine as the nourisher of all beings the fountain of life\n god the mother is frequently addressed in sanskrit hymns as jagata janani jagata palani the birthgiver and nourisher of the world jagat \n in eastern christianity one title given to the virgin mother mary is life giving spring\n god is also the seer of all the ruler of all as this verse indicates\n the petitioner then makes an interesting request withhold your light gather together your rays\n how is this why does he not ask that the light should flood down upon him because the light he is speaking of is not the absolute light but the light of relative existence which by its nature veils that ultimate light\n he asks then that god withdraw the light of temporality in order that he might behold and enter into the light of eternity\n this has a yogic aspect as well\n we must withdraw all the scattered rays of our energies and awareness and unite them to our inmost consciousness\n we must gather up that which is dispersed and fragmented and restore our original state of unity\n meditation is the only way this can be accomplished\n the vision may i behold through your grace your most blessed form\n two questions arise or should arise at these words\n what is the grace of god what is the form of god the grace of god is not some kind of favor or goodie dropped into our lap by god\n nor is grace something occasionally dispensed by god as a special token to the chosen\n all that exists either relatively or absolutely is the grace of god\n there is nothing that is not the grace of god\n if we like we may say that the grace of god is the divine plan for our liberation\n and the creation gross and subtle is the means for the realization of that plan and is itself grace divine\n so to petition god for grace is as silly as fish in the ocean praying for water\n it is inseparable from us the grace through which we behold god is the great onward movement initiated by god at the inception of the cosmos\n the form of god is not a form such as that experienced in relative existence but is the substance the light from which all forms arise\n it can be said to be formless and yet all forms exist within it eternally\n as sri ma anandamayi frequently said nothing is lost there\n the form of god is god\n when we see god we also see ourselves in god and can then declare the being that dwells therein even that being am i\n then satyakama son of shibi asked him the rishi pippalada venerable sir what world does he who meditates on om until the end of his life win by that to him he said that which is the sound om o satyakama is verily the higher and the lower brahman\n therefore with this support alone does the wise man reach the one or the other\n if he meditates on the supreme being parampurusha with the syllable om he becomes one with the light the sun\n he is led to the world of brahman\n he sees the person that dwells in the body who is higher than the highest life\n that the wise one attains even by the mere sound om as support that which is tranquil unaging immortal fearless and supreme\n the final aspiration the poet browning wrote of the end of life for which the first was made\n that is a lovely expression but very few really believe it and therefore rarely think of their life s end\n those of us who seek liberation must from the very beginning be looking toward the end we desire\n in the next to the last verse at the close of the isha upanishad we are given the perspective we should be living with every moment of our life if we would truly come to a good end\n now let my life now merge in the all pervading life\n ashes are my body s end\no mind remember brahman\n o mind remember your past deeds\n remember your past deeds\n emily dickenson wrote while others hope to go to heaven at last i am going all along this is the only way for those who would succeed in spiritual life\n nothing should be delayed for the future it is all now or not at all\n behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation there are many partially awakened people who know that god is the only real goal\n yet they delay their endeavor\n after i get this they say then i will really dig in and seek god\n but they never do for as soon as one little short term goal is reached another arises that seems even more demanding\n i know a woman that claimed she would intensely seek god the day after her only child graduated from high school\n but then it became after his graduating from college\n then after he was married and really settled down\n death found her anticipating still another after which but it was all over\n and by her foolishness she had created in her mind the habit of postponing spiritual life a habit that will surely carry over into the next life and perhaps into others\n how often do we think that the vision of god will somehow interfere with our life when in reality we have no life outside that vision\n silly children we dawdle and dally until the night falls that night in which no man can work which jesus warned us about\n now or never happens to be the simple truth\n merging in life many people want to embrace life so they can egocentrically possess it and exploit it to the full\n but they have no idea what life is\n just the opposite for what they think is life is really death\n the allpervading life is the only life for that is god\n and the necessity is not to find or see god as an object again to possess but to merge with god in complete unity identity\n that is our consciousness must be completely merged in the infinite consciousness and irrevocably so\n just as a cup of water poured into the ocean cannot be drawn back out of the ocean so we need to attain that state of unity which can never be reversed\n many yogis paddle their feet or go for a quick dip in the ocean of satchidananda but the goal is to unite with that ocean to merge in it and become totally one with it\n consequently at ever moment of our life we must be holding in mind and living out the sankalpa let my life now merge in the all pervading life\n those who are unfit for union with god become all anxious and even fearful when they hear about merging with the divine\n o will i go out of existence they quaver\n what will happen to me over and over again they plunge headlong into the sea of rebirth never raising such questions about relative existence but going for it heedlessly\n only when confronted with god do they develop prudence and caution\n jesus has assured us yough whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it\n this is because we are truly negative that is we are absolutely backwards one hundred and eighty degrees\n consequently what we think will annihilate us will immortalize us whereas what we think will make us live will destroy us\n like the great master yogananda we must pray let me drown in thine ocean and live understanding the destiny of the body it is not a simple thing to rid ourselves of the conditionings of billions of lives wherein we identified completely with the body\n even when we have evolved enough to identify more with the mind and the spirit still the body claims the majority of our attention and attachment\n it is completely reflexive with us overriding any emotional or intellectual factors to the contrary\n therefore we must continually affirm in word attitude and act ashes are my body s end\n this will only seem painful or pessimistic if we are still identifying with the body\n but if not it will be as happy a statement as an affirmation that our prison is going to evaporate into dust\n we have died many times or yought we did but that did not free us at all\n and in many lives we were no doubt cremated\n still that accomplished nothing\n evidently there is a deeper meaning to the ashes that are the body s end\n it is the fire of wisdom that turns our bodies into ashes\n let us then be busy stoking the fires of yoga and getting on with the burning\n sadhus wear gerua orange red color to remind them of the fire of discrimination and spirit knowledge that must be perpetually burning in order to reduce all that impels us into embodiment to the ashes of freedom\n flying from fear from lust and anger he hides in me his refuge his safety burnt clean in the blaze of my being in me many find home\n the blazing fire turns wood to ashes the fire of knowledge turns all karmas to ashes\n when the bridges of all bodies subtle and gross have been burned in the holy fires then we will pass on into the kingdom of infinity that is our eternal birthright\n remember how to kindle the ignorance consuming fire the upanishadic sage continues o mind remember brahman\n o mind remember your past deeds\n remember your past deeds\n remember brahman is extremely easy to say but how is it done the upanishads do not waste our time but go straight to the mark saying i will tell you briefly of that goal which all the vedas with one voice propound which all the austerities speak of and wishing for which people practice discipline it is om\n om is the supreme brahman\n god is the syllable om\n om is brahman the primeval being\n that om is the quintessence of the essences the supreme the highest\n after the battle of kurukshetra before which he had spoken the bhagavad gita krishna again spoke to arjuna at length\n in that conversation he told him the gods rishis and the nagas and the asuras approaching prajapati the creator said to him tell us the highest good\n to them who were inquiring about the highest good the venerable one said om which is brahman in a single syllable\n the monosyllable om is the highest brahman said the sage manu and patanjali summed it all up by simply saying its repetition and meditation is the way\n to remember brahman we engage in the japa and meditation of om simple and direct\n one should meditate on this syllable om \n this om is the best means of attainment and realization this means is the higher and lesser brahman\n meditating on om one becomes woryour of worship in the world of brahman\n the self atman is of the nature of the syllable om\n thus the syllable om is the very self\n he who knows it thus enters the self supreme spirit with his self individual spirit \n taking as the bow the great weapon of the upanishads om one should place in it the arrow sharpened by meditation\n drawing it with a mind engaged in the contemplation of that brahman o beloved know that imperishable brahman as the target\n the syllable om is the bow one s self indeed is the arrow\n brahman is spoken of as the target of that\n it is to be hit wiyout making a mistake\n thus one becomes united with it brahman as the arrow becomes one with the target\n he in whom the sky the earth and the interspace are woven as also the mind along with all the pranas know him alone as the one self\n this om is the bridge to immortality\n meditate on om as the self\n may you be successful in crossing over to the farther shore of darkness\n then satyakama son of shibi asked him the rishi pippalada venerable sir what world does he who meditates on om until the end of his life win by that to him he said if he meditates on the supreme being parampurusha with the syllable om he becomes one with the light the sun\n he is led to the world of brahman\n he sees the person that dwells in the body who is higher than the highest life\n that the wise one attains even by the mere sound om as support that which is tranquil unaging immortal fearless and supreme\n the knower of the real nature of brahman that is identical with the pranava should cross all the formidable streams of samsara with the ferryboat of the pranava\n he who utters om with the intention i shall attain brahman does verily attain brahman\n alternating remembrance the thorough practicality and good sense of dharma is one of its most striking features it works\n and it works very well\n so it is meaningful that the upanishad tells us to remember brahman then remember our own past deeds then remember brahman and then remember our own past deeds in a kind of alternating current\n this is to keep us from falling into two serious errors being so focused on the spiritual that we do not pay attention to what is really going on with us and becoming so obsessed with ourselves that we utterly leave god out of the picture\n patanjali lists swadhyaya introspective selfstudy as an essential ingredient of yoga practice\n yet this self study must be done in the greater context of divine consciousness in your light shall we see light\n only in the divine light can we see things as they really are\n so we should meditate on brahman through om and outside of meditation we should look at our past comparing our past deeds and our past states of mind with our present deeds and mental condition\n this will reveal to us whether we are truly progressing or not\n i knew a woman who sincerely believed that god was appearing to her in meditation and talking to her so sweetly making her feel so holy and pure\n then she would come out of meditation and be unspeakably cruel to her daughter both physically and mentally\n in meditation she was an angel but outside of meditation she was a devil\n wrong meditation gives us a wrong image of ourselves but right meditation shows us the truth about both god and ourselves\n of course we have to have a correct memory of our past\n many people are so blinded to the truth about themselves that when they learn to meditate they start saying my mind used to be calm but it has gotten so restless or i used to be a nice person but now i am just a wreck and falling apart\n the reality is that their mind was always restless but not being introspective they did not realize it\n they were also a complete ruin mentally and spiritually but they had no eyes with which to see it\n now they do and they foolishly blame meditation\n on the other hand people who are practicing a wrong form of meditation or a right form wrongly do become increasingly restless and increasingly negative\n i know of several kinds of meditation that really do bring about the mental and spiritual disintegration of those who practice them and often the physical degeneration as well\n but those who meditate according to the teachings of the upanishads will have no problem",

t know how to impart instruction about it \n distinct indeed is that from the known and distinct from the unknown\n thus have we heard from the ancients who expounded it to us\n that which is not uttered by speech that by which the word is expressed know that alone to be brahman and not this non brahman which is being worshiped\n that which one does not think with the mind that by which they say the mind is yought know that alone to be brahman and not this non brahman which is being worshiped\n that which man does not see with the eye that by which man sees the activities of the eye know

ruin\n having realized brahman in all beings and having withdrawn from this world the wise become immortal\n it is well known that brahman indeed achieved victory for the gods\n but in that victory which was brahman s the gods reveled in joy\n they yought ours alone is this victory ours alone is this glory \n brahman knew this their pride and appeared before them but they knew not who this yaksha worshipful being was\n they said to agni o jataveda know you this as to who this yaksha is \n he said so be it\n it asked him who art you he replied i am agni or i am jataveda \n it said what is the power in you such as you art agni said i can burn all this that is upon the earth\n for him it placed there a blade of grass and said burn this \n agni went near it in all haste but he could not burn it\n he returned from there and said i am unable to understand who that yaksha is \n then the gods said to vayu o vayu know you this as to who this yaksha is \n he said so be it \n it said to him who art you he replied i am vayu or i am matarsiva \n it said what is the power in you such as you art vayu said i can take hold of all this that is upon the earth \n for him it placed there a blade of grass and said take this up \n vayu went near it in all haste but he could not take it up\n he returned from there and said i am unable to understand who that yaksha is \n then the gods said to indra o maghava know you this as to who this yaksha is \n he said so be it \n he approached it but it disappeared from him\n in that space itself where the yaksha had disappeared indra approached an exceedingly charming woman\n to that uma decked in gold or to the daughter of the himalayas he said who is this yaksha she said it was brahman\n in the victory that was brahman s you were reveling in joy \n then alone did indra know for certain that it was brahman\n therefore these gods viz\n agni vayu and indra excelled other gods for they touched brahman who stood very close and indeed knew first that it was brahman\n therefore is indra more excellent than the other gods for he touched brahman who stood very close and indeed knew first that it was brahman\n its instruction regarding meditation is this\n it is similar to that which is like a flash of lightning or like the winkling of the eye\n this is the analogy of brahman in the divine aspect\n then follows the instruction through analogy on the aspect of the individual self\n it is wellknown that the mind seems to attain to it that it is continually remembered by the mind and that the mind possesses the yought regarding it \n that brahman is known indeed as tadvana worshipful or adorable to all beings that is to be worshiped as tadvana\n to him who knows it thus verily all beings pray\n i have spoken

no infidelity from my side\n may all the dharmas extolled by the upanishads shine in me who am intent on knowing the self\n may they shine in me om peace peace peace here ends the kenapanishad as contained in the sama veda\n commentary on the kena upanishad by swami nirmalananda giri the mover of the moved in the world we see a prime duality cause and effect\n yet we see no cause for the world itself\n inquiry into its cause naturally arises\n the lazy and the cowardly insist there is no cause and pursue their exploitation of the world and its inhabitants\n the woryour and the bold however seek to know\n many are the theories set forth by profound thinkers\n but those who have gone beyond yought into pure knowing have unanimously told us of the cause and in that insight have also come to perfectly understand the effect the world and all within it\n the question the kena upanishad opens with a question that is answered in the rest of the upanishad\n at whose behest does the mind think who bids the body live who makes the tongue speak who is that effulgent being that directs the eye to form and color and the ear to sound this is one of the few philosophical questions that really matter for if we come to the wrong conclusion it will cloud or even distort our understanding of life\n for example if we say god or nature or happenstance we will in essence be saying that we have nothing to do with our existence that a force far beyond us is making all this occur to us that we are like seaweed being carried along on the wave of the sea able to yearn for situations and things but unable to bring anything about\n if we are theists we believe that if we somehow do the needful in response god will give us what we want but still it will be his doing and beyond our capacity to accomplish or even hold on to once we have it\n this view of ourselves as utterly helpless and therefore utterly insignificant in the vast universe will cripple and frustrate us distorting us profoundly\n you are nothing becomes the watchword of our life a life which bears that maxim out\n hopeless and helpless we drift along controlled by everything that is other than us\n this is truly a living hell\n into this darkness shines the realization embodied in the upanishads a realization that we will somehow recognize from deep within us for that realization is ours on the inmost level of our existence\n we do not learn the truth we recognize it\n all right then who makes the mind think the body live the faculty of speech to manifest and causes the senses to operate the answer the self is ear of the ear mind of the mind speech of speech\n he is also breath of the breath and eye of the eye\n having given up the false identification of the self with the senses and the mind and knowing the self to be brahman the wise on departing this life become immortal\n the ear mind speech breath and eye are only instruments only messengers\n the one who causes them to function the hearer of hearing the witness of the mind and yought the understander of speech the source of the breath and the seer of seeing is the atman the self\n external experience may be illusory but if we trace the illusion back and back to the perceiver of perception we will find the reality that is the self\n in a motion picture we see so many images so many illusions but when the picture stops we see the pure white screen that was behind it all the time wiyout which no picture would have been possible\n such is the self\n knowing the self to be none other than brahman the absolute rebirth is no more\n swami prabhavananda has translated the word dhira as the wise but in actuality dhira means those who are steadfast in this instance those who are firmly established in the practice of yoga and in the realization arising from yoga\n brahman the inexpressible brahman is beyond all sensory perception or intellectual comprehension\n yet we can infer the existence of brahman by that which it causes to occur by the consciousness that does perceive and comprehend\n so in conclusion the upanishad says this which really needs little comment him the eye does not see nor the tongue express nor the mind grasp\n him we neither know nor are able to teach\n different is he from the known and different is he from the unknown\n so have we heard from the wise\n that which cannot be expressed in words but by which the tongue speaks know that to be brahman\n brahman is not the being who is worshiped of men\n that which is not comprehended by the mind but by which the mind comprehends know that to be brahman\n brahman is not the being who is worshiped of men\n that which is not seen by the eye but by which the eye sees know that to be brahman\n brahman is not the being who is worshiped of men\n that which is not heard by the ear but by which the ear hears know that to be brahman\n brahman is not the being who is worshiped of men\n that which is not drawn by the breath but by which the breath is drawn know that to be brahman\n brahman is not the being who is worshiped of men\n when the upanishad says that we do not know brahman it refers to intellectual knowledge\n therefore as it continues we cannot teach brahman as an intellectual subject\n when it says that brahman is different from the unknown it is not speaking of brahman s unknowability but rather that brahman is not an unknown object that in time the intellect will come to know\n the most striking part of this passage is the statement that brahman is not the being who is worshiped of men\n this presents two significant points\n first that brahman is not an object but the eternal subject and consequently cannot be worshiped as an object\n second men cannot relate to brahman at all but those that have passed beyond all relative identity can experience brahman as their own self\n knowing that is ignorance and unknowing that is knowing at the beginning all classical commentators say that in this second part of the kena upanishad the first two verses are a dialogue between a teacher and a student and the remaining three verses are an exposition of the discussion\n first the teacher says to the student if you think that you know well the truth of brahman know that you know little\n what you think to be brahman in your self or what you think to be brahman in the gods that is not brahman\n what is indeed the truth of brahman you must therefore learn\n the student responds i cannot say that i know brahman fully\n nor can i say that i know him not\n he among us knows him best who understands the spirit of the words nor do i know that i know him not\n to help us in this here is the translation of swami gambhirananda teacher if you think i have known brahman well enough then you have known only the very little expression that it has in the human body and the little expression that it has among the gods\n therefore brahman is still to be deliberated on by you\n student i think brahman is known\n i do not think i know brahman well enough i\n i consider not that i do not know i know and i do not know as well\n he among us who understands that utterance not that i do not know\n i know and i do not know as well knows that brahman \n that may have only compounded the bewilderment but we can untangle it with patience\n these verses are excellent examples of the difficulty we have when we try to speak the unspeakable and explain the unexplainable\n an easy mistake brahman is not only everywhere but actually is all things\n this too we cannot exactly comprehend and to express it simplistically is to make things much worse\n because of this it is easy for those who have experienced only a hint of brahman even a hint of which is tremendous to say now i know brahman\n but that would be like someone who has seen a cup of seawater saying now i have seen the sea\n if we do not know brahman fully we cannot truly say that we know brahman at all\n yet there is a knowing that is beyond the intellect and is both knowing and unknowing in an experiential sense\n this is why a medieval mystical english text on the knowledge of god is called the cloud of unknowing\n when we know brahman we know that it cannot known in the human sense of knowing\n the same concept is held in eastern christianity where it is said that god cannot be seen but you must see god to realize that he cannot be seen\n is all this said to confuse and mystify us no but it does have the purpose of our giving up the hopeless attempt to comprehend brahman intellectually\n so the teacher says that to think we know brahman when we have just glimpsed a hint of its existence is a mistake\n the clever student however points out that we can dimly know something of brahman\n he then points out that when come to truly know brahman we will understand that we both know and do not know brahman that it is foolish to say either i know brahman or i do not know brahman\n in wisdom the two go together\n if you still do not get the idea do not worry\n the upanishadic author assumed we might not so he gives us this verse to clear things up he truly knows brahman who knows him as beyond knowledge he who thinks that he knows knows not\n the ignorant think that brahman is known but the wise know him to be beyond knowledge\n practical experience the knowledge of brahman is not an intellectual matter and neither is it incapacitating despite the common misconception that mystical vision renders us unfit for practical life\n so the next verse tells us he who realizes the existence of brahman behind every activity of his being whether sensing perceiving or thinking he alone gains immortality\n through knowledge of brahman comes power\n through knowledge of brahman comes victory over death\n to live in unbroken consciousness of god is liberation\n liberation is possible even here in this world while living in the body\n for the upanishad continues blessed is the man who while he yet lives realizes brahman\n the man who realizes him not suffers his greatest loss\n when they depart this life the wise who have realized brahman as the self in all beings become immortal\n the blessed blessed is the man who while he yet lives realizes brahman\n the man who realizes him not suffers his greatest loss\n when they depart this life the wise who have realized brahman as the self in all beings become immortal\n swami nikhilananda renders this verse if a man knows atman here he then attains the true goal of life\n if he does not know it here a great destruction awaits him\n having realized the self in every being the wise relinquish the world and become immortal\n here and now it is affirmed over and over in the upanishads and the bhagavad gita that perfect realization and liberation is possible even here in the world\n this is one of the glories of sanatana dharma\n it does not hold out some vague bye and bye hope to be realized only after death a sure trait of fraudulent religion\n the truth of the eternal religion including yoga can be proven at every moment of our life just as advances in science especially in physics and astronomy reveal the truths intuited by the sages of india yousands of years ago\n we need to hold firmly to the fact that we can overcome ignorance and bondage in this very lifetime that we need not think it will take many incarnations to come to enlightenment\n the bhagavad gita particularly emphasizes the immediacy of our spiritual potential\n faith another trait of false religion is not needed either\n our practice of yoga and the resulting maturation of consciousness will enable us to see experience and demonstrate the great truths of the upanishads\n what about doubts they mean nothing any more than blind beliefs\n in some instances a negative rejection of truth on the subconscious level masquerades as doubts and can hinder our progress\n but honest doubts cannot\n i could cite for you many instances in which i not only doubted something i denied its possibility but still i came to see for myself the truth of what i had not believed\n my practice of yoga kept pushing the frontiers of my insight into areas that i had ignorantly yought were superstition or silly\n and my doubt and denial did not delay even for a moment my coming to understand the truth i had disbelieved\n this is why no scripture of india is considered to be the word of god the supreme and final authority\n scriptures like spiritual teachers can only point the way but they cannot definitively state the truth\n yet through interior development there is nothing that can elude the yogi in his quest for reality\n this is why krishna speaks of abhyasa yoga the yoga of practice as the foundation for those who wish to really know\n the great loss those who do not realize god suffer the greatest loss for they lose themselves and god\n what then is left for them nothing\n desolate they wander in the desert of their own barren minds and hearts\n shankara says that the mahati vinashtih the great destruction is interminable birth and death in the material world with all is attendant pains sorrows and fears\n the great gain on the other hand the wise whose consciousness is steadfastly fixed in god turn away from the world or more exactly from the bonds and blandishments of the world and become immortal amritam bhavanti by entering forever into immortal brahman\n blessed are those who live their lives in the perspective of this single verse\n realization and attainment shall be theirs\n for them immortality shall be their assured and eternal future\n approaching brahman the kena upanishad is quite brief and now concludes with a story and a short reflection on the story\n here is the story the victory of the gods once the gods won a victory over the demons and yough they had done so only through the power of brahman they were exceedingly vain\n they yought to themselves it was we who beat our enemies and the glory is ours\n brahman saw their vanity and appeared before them\n but they did not recognize him\n then the other gods said to the god of fire fire find out for us who this mysterious spirit is\n yes said the god of fire and approached the spirit\n the spirit said to him who are you i am the god of fire\n as a matter of fact i am very widely known\n and what power do you wield i can burn anything on earth\n burn this said the spirit placing a straw before him\n the god of fire fell upon it with all his might but could not consume it\n so he ran back to the other gods and said i cannot discover who this mysterious spirit is\n then said the other gods to the god of wind wind do you find out for us who he is\n yes said the god of wind and approached the spirit\n the spirit said to him who are you i am the god of wind\n as a matter of fact i am very widely known\n i fly swiftly through the heavens\n and what power do you wield i can blow away anything on earth\n blow this away said the spirit placing a straw before him\n the god of wind fell upon it with all his might but was unable to move it\n so he ran back to the other gods and said i cannot discover who this mysterious spirit is\n then said the other gods to indra greatest of them all o respected one find out for us we pray you who he is\n yes said indra and drew nigh to the spirit\n but the spirit vanished and in his place stood uma god the mother well adorned and of exceeding beauty\n beholding her indra asked who was the spirit that appeared to us that answered uma was brahman\n through him it was not of yourselves that you attained your victory and your glory\n thus did indra and the god of fire and the god of wind come to recognize brahman\n the divine power this is a very straightforward account\n the gods are mostly the intelligent faculties of the individual human being\n the doctrinal element is very simple the senses and mind cannot comprehend brahman but its truth can be revealed by the divine feminine aspect of god mahashakti or adishakti the great primal power that is the dynamic aspect of brahman the prakriti divine creative energy that is inseparable from purusha the supreme spirit\n god the father is unmoving consciousness whereas god the mother is moving consciousness\n the entire field of creation is mother the father being the transcendental witness of her manifestations\n the mother is the divine ladder which we ascend to the bosom of the father\n prakriti proceeds from purusha the holy spirit proceeds from the father\n the fundamental idea of the dance of the creative energy before the face of the supreme spirit is found in the book of proverbs where she speaks of herself saying the lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways before he made any thing from the beginning\n i was set up from eternity and of old before the earth was made\n the depths were not as yet and i was already conceived\n neither had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out the mountains with their huge bulk had not as yet been established before the hills i was brought forth he had not yet made the earth nor the rivers nor the poles of the world\n when he prepared the heavens i was present when with a certain law and compass he enclosed the depths when he established the sky above and poised the fountains of waters when he compassed the sea with its bounds and set a law to the waters that they should not pass their limits when be balanced the foundations of the earth i was with him forming all things and was delighted every day playing before him at all times playing in the world\n the divine mother dances the dance of creation before the witnessing lord\n alyough prabhavananda used the expression uma god the mother the sanskrit phrase is uma haimavatim\n uma in indian history was the daughter of king himalaya and so was called himavati\n she was considered a manifestion avatara of the divine mother aspect of god\n uma is a name often given the divine power\n but shankara has a different and interesting interpretation of haimavatim\n he say it means one who was as yough attired in dress of gold\n this is most intriguing because in the bible we have similar imagery of the divine mother the queen sometimes called the king s daughter because she emanates from the king being dressed in gold\n david wrote upon your right hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir\n and a few verses later the king s daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of wrought gold\n in the book of revelation we find there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun\n in this instance the gold is the light of the sun\n the elements the god of fire the god of wind and indra these excelled the other gods for they approached nearest to brahman and were the first to recognize him\n as said above in this upanishadic story the gods are mostly the intelligent faculties of the individual human being\n however agni vayu and indra are representative of the primeval elements fire air and ether\n these are closer to the self to brahman than are the earth and water elements whose faculties are smell and taste\n the faculties of fire air and ether respectively are sight touch and sound\n in meditation we see light of various colors experience sensations that are the inner modes of touch and in our silent japa of om hear the inner mental sound\n these are three revealers of the presence of the self brahman\n however but of all gods indra is supreme for he approached nearest of the three to brahman and was the first of the three to recognize him\n the etheric body is the nearest to the self and its faculty of sound is that which unites our consciousness with brahman\n thus etheric sound is the supreme god by which we recognize perceive spirit\n brahman in all brahman and shakti power are in reality one\n sri ramakrishna often used the simile of fire and its power to burn\n fire is the purusha and the burning power is the prakriti\n it is not amiss to say that prakriti is the effect of the presence of brahman is brahman itself\n the upanishad recapitulates this saying this is the truth of brahman in relation to nature whether in the flash of the lightning or in the wink of the eyes the power that is shown is the power of brahman\n this is the truth of brahman in relation to man in the motions of the mind the power that is shown is the power of brahman\n for this reason should a man meditate upon brahman by day and by night\n wherefore brahman is the adorable being in all beings\n meditate upon him as such\n he who meditates upon him as such is honored by all other beings\n it is the presence of brahman which draws us to seek after or value an object\n as the brihadaranyaka upanishad says it is not for the sake of the husband my beloved that the husband is dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the wife my beloved that the wife is dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the children my beloved that the children are dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of wealth my beloved that wealth is dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the brahmins my beloved that the brahmins are held in reverence but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the kshatriyas my beloved that the kshatriyas are held in honor but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the higher worlds my beloved that the higher worlds are desired but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the gods my beloved that the gods are worshiped but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the creatures my beloved that the creatures are prized but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of itself my beloved that anything whatever is esteemed but for the sake of the self\n the proof of this is the fact that when we successfully meditate on brahman other sentient beings will sense the presence of brahman in us and value us accordingly\n it is now up to us the teaching is wonderful but it is not enough\n the student of the upanishadic sage intuits this but comes to a wrong conclusion asking sir teach me more of the knowledge of brahman\n but the teacher responds i have told you the secret knowledge\n naturally the student will assume as would we that the secret knowledge is the philosophy about brahman etc\n therefore the teacher continues austerity self control performance of duty wiyout attachment these are the body of that knowledge\n the vedas are its limbs\n truth is its very soul\n the importance of this perspective simply cannot be exaggerated\n the secret knowledge is not philosophic formulations it is practice what krishna calls abhyasa yoga the yoga of practice\n the vedas are only its adjuncts\n truth is at its heart to be realized by the practitioners\n tapasya selfmastery and karma yoga form the body of the secret knowledge\n there are no effects wiyout a cause\n these three cause the knowing of brahman\n about which the sage concludes he who attains to knowledge of brahman being freed from all evil finds the eternal the supreme",
    "Katha": "translaetd by vidyavachaspati v\n panoli om may he protect us both together by illumining the nature of knowledge \n may he sustain us both by ensuring the fruits of knowledge \n may we attain the vigour of knowledge together\n let what we learn enlighten us\n let us not hate each other\n om peace peace peace out of desire so goes the story the son of vajasrava gave away all his wealth\n he had a son named nachiketas\n though young faith possessed him as presents were being brought he yought water has been drunk for the last time by these cows grass has been eaten for the last time they have yielded all their milk and are devoid of the power of the organs\n those worlds are indeed joyless where he goes who offers these\n he then said to his parent father to whom wilt you give me a second time and a third time he said it \n to him he the father said to death i give you\n of many i go the first of many i go the middle most\n what purpose of yama could there be which my father will get accomplished today through me think how your ancestors behaved behold how others now behave\n like corn man decays and like corn he is born again\n like vaisvanara fire a brahmana guest enters the houses\n men offer this to propitiate him\n o vaivasvata yama fetch water for him \n hope expectation association with the effects of these two pleasant discourse sacrifice acts of pious liberality sons and cattle all these are destroyed in the case of the man of little intellect in whose house a brahmana dwells wiyout food\n o brahmana since you a worshipful guest hast dwelt in my house for three nights wiyout food let me make salutation to you\n o brahmana may peace be with me\n therefore ask for three boons in return\n o death let gautama my father be relieved of the anxiety let him become calm in mind and free from anger towards me and let him recognise me and talk to me when liberated by you\n of the three boons this is the first i choose\n ouddalaki the son of aruna will recognise you as before and will with my permission sleep peacefully during nights and on seeing you released from the jaws of death he will be free from anger\n there is no fear in heaven nor art you there nor is there any fear from old age\n transcending both hunger and thirst and rising above grief man rejoices in heaven\n o death you knowest the fire that leads to heaven\n instruct me who am endowed with faith about that fire by which those who dwell in heaven attain immortality\n this i choose for my second boon\n i will teach you well listen to me and understand o nachiketas i know the fire that leads to heaven\n know that fire which is the means for the attainment of heaven and which is the support of the universe and located in the cavity\n death told him of the fire the source of the worlds the sort of bricks for raising the sacrificial altar how many and how to kindle the fire and he nachiketas too repeated it as it was told\n then death becoming delighted over it said again the exalted one being pleased said to him i grant you again another boon now\n by your name itself shall this fire be known and accept you this necklace of manifold forms \n whoso kindles the nachiketas fire thrice and becomes united with the three and does the threefold karma transcends birth and death\n knowing the omniscient one born of brahma bright and adorable and realizing it he attains to surpassing peace\n he who knowing the three form of brick etc\n piles up the nachiketa fire with this knowledge throws off the chains of death even before the body falls off and rising over grief rejoices in heaven\n this is the fire o nachiketas which leads to heaven and which you hast chosen for the second boon\n of this fire people will speak as yours indeed\n o nachiketas choose the third boon\n this doubt as to what happens to a man after death some say he is and some others say he is not i shall know being taught by you\n of the boons this is the third boon\n even by the gods this doubt was entertained in days of yore\n this topic being subtle is not easy to comprehend\n ask for some other boon o nachiketas\n don t press me give up this boon for me\n nachiketas said since even by the gods was doubt entertained in this regard and since you sayest o death that this is not easily comprehended no other preceptor like you can be had to instruct on this nor is there any other boon equal to this\n ask for sons and grandsons who will live a hundred years\n ask for herds of cattle elephants gold and horses as also for a vast extent of earth and yourself live for as many autumns as you desirest\n if you thinkest any other boon to be equal to this ask for wealth and longevity\n be you the ruler over a vast country o nachiketas i shall make you enjoy all your longings\n what all things there are in the human world which are desirable but hard to win pray for all those desirable things according to your pleasure\n here are these damsels with the chariots and lutes the like of whom can never be had by men\n by them given by me get your services rendered o nachiketas do not ask about death\n these o death are ephemeral and they tend to wear out the vigour of all the senses of man\n even the whole life is short indeed\n be yours alone the chariots be yours the dance and music\n man cannot be sait isfied with wealth\n if we need wealth we shall get it if we only see you\n we shall live until such time as you wilt rule\n but the boon to be asked for by me is that alone\n having gained contact with the undecaying and the immortal what decaying mortal dwelling on the earth below who knows the higher goal will delight in long life after becoming aware of the transitoriness of beauty varian and sport rati and the joy pramoda thereof\n o death tell us of that of the great beyond about which man entertain doubt\n nachiketas does not pray for any other boon than this which enters into the secret that is hidden\n different is that which is preferable and different indeed is the pleasurable\n these two serving different purposes blind man\n good accrues to him who of these two chooses the preferable\n he who chooses the pleasurable falls from the goal\n the preferable and the pleasurable approach man\n the intelligent one examines both and separates them\n yea the intelligent one prefers the preferable to the pleasurable whereas the ignorant one selects the pleasurable for the sake of yoga attainment of that which is not already possessed and kshema the preservation of that which is already in possession \n thou hast relinquished o nachiketas all objects of desire dear and of covetable nature pondering over their worthlessness\n thou hast not accepted the path of wealth in which perish many a mortal\n what is known as ignorance and what is known as knowledge are highly opposed to each other and lead to different ways\n i consider nachiketas to be aspiring after knowledge for desires numerous yough they be did not tear you away\n living in the midst of ignorance and deeming themselves intelligent and enlightened the ignorant go round and round staggering in crooked paths like the blind led by the blind\n the means of attaining the other world does not become revealed to the non discriminating one who deluded by wealth has become negligent\n he who thinks this world alone is and none else comes to my thraldom again and again\n of the self many are not even able to hear him many yough they hear do not comprehend\n wonderful is the expounder of the self and attainer proficient\n the knower of the self taught by an able preceptor is wonderful\n this self if taught by an inferior person is not easily comprehended for it is variously yought of\n unless taught by another who is a perceiver of non difference there is no way of comprehending it for it is not arguable and is subtler than subtlety\n this knowledge of the self attained by you cannot be had through argumentation\n o dearest this doctrine only if taught by some teacher other than a logician leads to right knowledge\n o you art rooted in truth\n may a questioner be ever like you o nachiketas\n i know that the treasure is impermanent for that which is constant cannot be reached by things which are not constant\n therefore has the nachiketa fire been kindled by me with impermanent things and i have attained the eternal\n the fulfilment of all desires the support of the universe the endless fruits of sacrifice the other shore of fearlessness the extensive path which is praiseworyour and great as also your own exalted state seeing all these you hast intelligent as you art boldly rejected them \n the intelligent one knowing through concentration of mind the self that is hard to perceive lodged in the innermost recess located in intelligence seated amidst misery and ancient abandons joy and grief\n having heard this and grasped it well the mortal separating the virtuous being from the body etc\n and attaining this subtle self rejoices having obtained that which causes joy\n the abode of brahman i think is wide open unto nachiketas\n tell me of that which you seest as distinct from virtue distinct from vice distinct from effect and cause distinct from the past and the future\n the goal which all the vedas expound which all austerities declare and desiring which aspirants resort to brahmacharya that goal i tell you briefly it is this om\n this syllable om indeed is the lower brahman this syllable indeed is the higher brahman whosoever knows this syllable indeed attains whatsoever he desires\n this support is the best this support is the supreme\n knowing this support one is magnified in the world of brahman\n the intelligent self is not born nor does it die\n it did not come from anywhere nor did anything come from it\n it is unborn eternal everlasting and ancient and is not slain even when the body is slain\n if the slayer thinks that he slays it and if the slain thinks of it as slain both these do not know for it does not slay nor is it slain\n the self that is subtler than the subtle and greater than the great is seated in the heart of every creature\n one who is free from desire sees the glory of the self through the tranquility of the mind and senses and becomes absolved from grief\n while sitting it goes far while lying it goes everywhere\n who other than me can know that deity who is joyful and joyless\n the intelligent one having known the self to be bodiless in all bodies to be firmly seated in things that are perishable and to be great and all pervading does not grieve\n the self cannot be attained by the study of the vedas not by intelligence nor by much hearing\n only by him who seeks to know the self can it be attained\n to him the self reveals its own nature\n none who has not refrained from bad conduct whose senses are not under restraint whose mind is not collected or who does not preserve a tranquil mind can attain this self through knowledge\n the self to which both the brahmana and the kshatriya are food as it were and death a soup how can one know thus where it is\n the knowers of brahman and those who kindle the five fires and propitiate the nachiketa fire thrice speak of as light and shade the two that enjoy the results of righteous deeds entering within the body into the innermost cavity of the heart the supreme abode of brahman \n may we be able to know the nachiketa fire which is the bridge for the sacrificers as also the imperishable brahman fearless as well as the other shore for those who are desirous of crossing the ocean of samsara \n know the self to be the master of the chariot and the body to be the chariot\n know the intellect to be the charioteer and the mind to be the reins\n the senses they speak of as the horses the objects within their view the way\n when the self is yoked with the mind and the senses the wise call it the enjoyer\n but whoso is devoid of discrimination and is possessed of a mind ever uncollected his senses are uncontrollable like the vicious horses of a driver\n but whoso is discriminative and possessed of a mind ever collected his senses are controllable like the good horses of a driver\n but whoso is devoid of a discriminating intellect possessed of an unrestrained mind and is ever impure does not attain that goal but goes to samsara\n but whoso is possessed of a discriminating intellect and a restrained mind and is ever pure attains that goal from which he is not born again\n but the man who has a discriminating intellect as his driver and a controlled mind as the reins reaches the end of the path that supreme state of vishnu\n the sensory objects are subtler than the senses and subtler than the sensory objects is mind\n but intellect is subtler than mind and subtler than intellect is mahat the hiranyagarbha \n the unmanifested avyakta is subtler than mahat hiranyagarbha and subtler than the unmanifested is purusha\n there is nothing subtler than purusha\n that is the end that is the supreme goal\n this self hidden in all beings does not shine\n but by seers of subtle and pointed intellect capable of perceiving subtle objects it is seen\n let the wise man merge speech in his mind merge that mind into the intelligent self and the intelligent self into the mahat\n let him then merge the mahat into the peaceful self\n arise awake and learn by approaching the exalted ones for that path is sharp as a razor s edge impassable and hard to go by say the wise\n by knowing that which is soundless touchless formless undecaying so also tasteless eternal odorless beginningless endless subtler than mahat and constant man is liberated from the jaws of death\n narrating and hearing this eternal story of nachiketas told by death the intelligent man attains glory in the world of brahman\n whoso becoming pure causes this supreme secret to be recited before am assembly of the brahmanas or at the time of sraddha that ceremony secures for him infinite results secures infinite results\n the self existent damned the out going senses\n therefore one sees externally and not the internal self\n someone who is intelligent with his eyes turned away desirous of immortality sees the inner self\n the unintelligent go after outward pleasures they fall into the meshes of wide spread death\n but the intelligent having known immortality to be constant never covet here objects that are inconstant\n by the self a man knows form taste odor sound touch and the sexual joy\n what remains here unknowable to the self this verily is that you seekest \n knowing that great and all pervading self by which one sees the objects both in the sleep and the waking states the intelligent man grieves no more\n whoso knows the self closely the honey eater the supporter of the vital airs and the lord of the past and the future will not henceforward protect himself\n this verily is that you seekest \n he who perceives the first born that came into being from tapas brahman before the waters and that entering into the cavity of the heart is seated there he perceives that very brahman\n this verily is that you seekest \n he who perceives this aditi that comes into being as the prana comprising all the gods that is manifested along with the elements and that entering into the cavity of the heart is seated there he perceives that very brahman\n this verily is that you seekest \n the sacrificial fire lodged in the two aranis even as the foetus is carefully borne by the pregnant woman is fit to be worshipped every day by men who are wakeful and possessed of oblation\n this verily is that you seekest \n on that from which the sun rises and in which it sets are fixed all the gods\n none ever goes beyond that\n this verily is that you seekest \n what indeed is here is there what is there is here again\n whoso here sees as yough different passes from death to death\n by mind alone is this attainable there is no difference here whatsoever\n whoso here sees as yough different passes from death to death\n the purusha of the size of a thumb dwells in the body\n realizing him as the lord of the past and the future one does not henceforward want to protect oneself\n this verily is that you seekest \n the purusha of the size of a thumb is like a smokeless flame and is the lord of the past and the future\n he certainly exists now and shall certainly exist tomorrow\n this verily is that you seekest \n as rain water fallen on a mountain ridge runs down the rocks so does one seeing the selves differently run after them alone\n as pure water poured into pure water remains the same only so does the self of the thinker who knows thus become o gautama\n the city of the unborn whose knowledge is like the light of the sun consists of eleven gates\n meditating on him one does not grieve and becoming free from bondage one becomes liberated\n this verily is that you seekest \n as mover sun he dwells in heaven as air he pervades everything and dwells in inter space as fire on the earth as guest in the houses he dwells in men dwells in the gods dwells in truth and dwells in space\n he is all that is born in water all that is born on earth all that is born in sacrifices and all that is born on the mountains he is unchanging and great\n he raises the prana upward and casts the apana downward\n all the gods worship him who is adorable and seated in the middle\n when this self seated in the body is torn away and freed from the body what remains here this verily is that you seekest \n not by prana not by apana does a mortal live but all live by something else on which these two depend\n i will describe to you o gautama this secret ancient brahman and also what becomes of the self after death\n some jivas enter the womb for assuming bodies others go into the unmoving in accordance with their karma and with their knowledge\n this purusha who is awake when all are asleep creating all things cherished is certainly pure that is brahman that is called the immortal\n all worlds are strung on that none passes beyond that\n this verily is that you seekest \n just as fire yough one having entered the world assumes a separate form in respect of every form so does the in dwelling self of all beings yough one assume a form in respect of every form and is outside it\n just as wind yough one having entered the world assumes a separate form in respect of each form so does the in dwelling self of all beings yough one assumes a form in respect of every form and is outside it\n just as the sun which is the eye of the entire world is not tainted by the external impurities seen by the eyes so also the in dwelling self of all beings yough one is not tainted by the sorrows of the world it being external\n eternal happiness belongs to the intelligent not to others who realize in their hearts him who is one the controller and the in dwelling self of all beings and who makes the one form manifold\n whoso among the intelligent realize the self in the inner space of the heart as the eternal among the ephemeral the consciousness among the conscious who yough one dispenses the desired objects to many to them belongs eternal peace not to others\n how shall i know that indescribable and supreme bliss which they think of as this is it selfluminous or does it shine distinctly making itself perceptible to the intellect or does it not there the sun shines not nor do the moon and the stars nor do these lightnings\n how then can this fire shine everything shines after him that shines\n by his light shines all this\n this peepul tree with root above and branches down is eternal\n that which is its source is certainly pure that is brahman and that is called immortal\n on that are strung all the worlds none passes beyond that\n this verily is that you seekest \n all this universe evolved from brahman moves in prana in brahman the most frightful like an uplifted thunderbolt\n those who know this become immortal\n for fear of him fire burns for fear of him shines the sun for fear of him indra and vayu function for fear of him death the fifth stalks on the earth\n if one could know here prior to the falling of the body one becomes liberated if not one becomes fit to be embodied in the worlds of creatures\n as in a mirror so in one s intellect as in a dream so in the world of manes as seen in water so in the world of the gandharvas as in the case of shade and light so in the world of brahma\n the intelligent man having known the different nature of the senses originating separately from their causes as also their rising and setting does not grieve\n the mind is subtler than the senses subtler than the mind is the intellect mahat hiranyagarbha is subtler than the intellect subtler than mahat is avyakta unmanifested \n but subtler than avyakta is purusha all pervading and wiyout a linga distinguishing mark indeed knowing whom a mortal becomes freed and attains immortality\n his form does not stand within the scope of vision none beholds him with the eye\n by the intellect restraining the mind and through meditation is he revealed\n those who know this become immortal\n when the five senses of knowledge are at rest together with the mind and the intellect is not active that state they call the highest\n that steady restraint over the senses they regard as yoga\n then one becomes vigilant for yoga can indeed originate in one and can be lost as well \n not by speech not by mind not by the eye can it be attained\n except in the case of one who says it exists how can it be known to anyone else the self should be apprehended as existing and also as it really is\n of these two aspects to him who knows it to exist its true nature is revealed\n when all longings that are in the heart vanish then a mortal becomes immortal and attains brahman here\n when all the knots of the heart are cut asunder here then a mortal becomes immortal\n only this much is the instruction\n there are a hundred and one nerves of the heart\n of then one goes out piercing the head\n going up through that one attains immortality the others serve for departing in different ways\n purusha of the size of a thumb the inner self is ever seated in the heart of all living beings\n one should with steadiness separate him from one s own body as stalk from the munja grass\n one should know him as pure and immortal one should know him as pure and immortal\n nachiketas then having acquired this knowledge imparted by death as also the instructions on yoga in entirety attained brahman having become dispassionate and deathless\n so does become any one else also who knows the inner self thus\n om may he protect us both together by illumining the nature of knowledge \n may he sustain us both by ensuring the fruits of knowledge \n may we attain the vigour of knowledge together\n let what we learn enlighten us\n let us not hate each other\n om peace peace peace here ends the kathopanishad as contained in the krishna yajur veda\n commentary on the katha upanishad by swami nirmalananda giri the past is the future in very ancient times a man named vajrabasa decided to perform a rite intended to give the performer great merit\n the rite entailed the giving away of all the performer s possessions\n however he had no such intention and instead was going to give away only his cattle and of them only the useless ones the old the barren the blind and the lame\n his son nachiketa observing this came to his father and said father do not repent your vow consider how it has been with those that have gone before and how it will be with those that now live\n like corn a man ripens and falls to the ground like corn he springs up again in his season\n there is no use denying it we all follow in the path of vajrabasa on occasion yough some do it more exuberantly\n this is especially deadly in the realm of spiritual life\n i well remember when two newly made indian friends from south india asked me wonderingly what is an indian giver when i said it meant someone who promised but did not deliver or who gave and then took back they were really bewildered\n but when i explained that it was not the indians who were the givers but the deceitful white men they understood and to my confusion yought it was very funny\n when i told them about honest injun and the only good indian is a dead indian they laughed till they cried and thereafter frequently asked honest injun when i told them something\n it is not funny when we are indian givers in spiritual life just as double tongued and devious with god and our own spirit as the politicians were with the native americans\n one of the funniest and most typical examples is found in the comic motion picture the end\n in one scene burt reynolds is swimming in the ocean about to drown\n he starts shouting out to god how much of his income he vows to give if he survives\n the percentage goes up and up to the total amount\n but then he sees that there is a chance he may make it back to shore\n so the percentage starts dropping in proportion to how near he gets to the land finally he is telling god that he will be giving nothing and if god does not like it that is just too bad\n we are very much often exactly like that ourselves\n when we think we are not going to have something or will have no use for it we generously offer it to god or renounce it\n but the moment we see a need or a use for it then we announce to ourselves that god would not expect us to hand it over or renounce it\n many people start out spiritual life with great enthusiasm ready to dedicate and sacrifice in order to attain liberation\n but as time goes by the sands in the hourglass of will and interest grow less and less shifting back to the bottom level of ego and the material life until what remains is so feeble and negligible it would be better if it too were eliminated in honesty\n the principle that we reap only and exactly what we sow is an absolute in spiritual life\n here are saint paul s words on the subject be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap\n for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting\n and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not\n fainting is a very real possibility for all of us and that is why these warning words of nachiketa were written in the upanishad father do not repent your vow consider how it has been with those that have gone before and how it will be with those that now live\n like corn a man ripens and falls to the ground like corn he springs up again in his season\n the law of reaping what has been sown and conversely not reaping what has not been sown is to be taken most seriously in all aspects of life but especially in spiritual matters\n solomon cautions us when you vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it for better is it that you shouldest not vow than that you shouldest vow and not pay\n the question here is not that of god being angry or sad at our non payment but the negative effect our own perfidy will have on us directly\n it is not god that rewards and punishes but our own self and its justice is inexorable\n so asking god to release us or forgive us means positively nothing it is our own self we are dealing with and it cannot be gotten around in any degree whatsoever\n sad to say there are many examples of those that have gone before who foolishly reneged on their own selves and suffered the consequences from simple unhappiness to abject and long lasting misery and even death\n this latter is no exaggeration i know of examples myself\n if you will excuse me i will not cite any examples at all for it is simply too bleak\n just do not be one yourself but i will tell you the principle i have seen demonstrated over and over again whatever a person abandons his spiritual life to keep or to gain will be usually abruptly or even violently taken away from him and he will never regain or restart his spiritual life in this incarnation\n i have never seen an exception\n i am however not speaking of merely risking or retarding the personal spiritual life we all do that just from making mistakes or from silly foibles but of the actual giving up and turning from even rejecting of one s spiritual life and obligations\n at every step of our spiritual life we must keep in mind the law of cause and effect and consider how it has been with those that have gone before and how it will be with those that now live\n and lest we think that if we escape the karmic reaction in this life we are home free nachiketa added like corn a man ripens and falls to the ground like corn he springs up again in his season\n so there are future lives in which our neglect can come to fruition in many forms all inimical to our further progress\n of course the words of nachiketa only have meaning to the wise\n as krishna told arjuna even a wise man acts according to the tendencies of his own nature\n all living creatures follow their tendencies\n what use is any external restraint if a man keeps following my teaching with faith in his heart and does not make mental reservations he will be released from the bondage of his karma\n but those who scorn my teaching and do not follow it are lost\n they are wiyout spiritual discrimination\n all their knowledge is a delusion\n seeing death seeing life visiting death long ago a man named vajrabasa undertook a ritual to gain divine favor but deliberately performed it in such a way that only misfortune could accrue to him rather than good\n his virtuous son nachiketa tried to reason with him but in response he uttered the curse thee i give to death nachiketa was no ordinary son\n he was an accomplished yogi one who could penetrate into the unseen worlds and in keeping with his unjust father s unjust words he went to the realm presided over by yamaraja the king of death\n yama welcomed him with great respect and told nachiketa to ask three favors from him\n being a woryour son of an unworyour father his first request was that his father should suffer no anxiety about his fate but that his anger should be appeased so that when nachiketa returned home his father would acknowledge and welcome him\n next nachiketa asked to learn the sacrificial rite that leads to heaven\n yama agreed to that also and taught him\n then yama asked him to make his third request\n the upanishadic text continues and then nachiketa considered within himself and said when a man dies there is this doubt some say he is others say he is not\n taught by you i would know the truth\n this is my third wish\n nay replied death even the gods were once puzzled by this mystery\n subtle indeed is the truth regarding it not easy to understand\n choose you some other boon o nachiketa\n but nachiketa would not be denied\n thou sayest o death that even the gods were once puzzled by this mystery and that it is not easy to understand\n surely there is no teacher better able to explain it than you and there is no other boon equal to this\n to which trying nachiketa again the god replied ask for sons and grandsons who shall live a hundred years\n ask for cattle elephants horses gold\n choose for yourself a mighty kingdom\n or if you canst imagine aught better ask for that not for sweet pleasures only but for the power beyond all yought to taste their sweetness\n yea verily the supreme enjoyer will i make you of every good thing\n celestial maidens beautiful to behold such indeed as were not meant for mortals even these together with their bright chariots and their musical instruments will i give unto you to serve you\n but for the secret of death o nachiketa do not ask but nachiketa stood fast and said these things endure only till the morrow o destroyer of life and the pleasures they give wear out the senses\n keep you therefore horses and chariots keep dance and song for yourself\n how shall he desire wealth o death who once has seen your face nay only the boon that i have chosen that only do i ask\n having found out the society of the imperishable and the immortal as in knowing you i have done how shall i subject to decay and death and knowing well the vanity of the flesh how shall i wish for long life tell me o king the supreme secret regarding which men doubt\n no other boon will i ask\n whereupon the king of death well pleased at heart began to teach nachiketa the secret of immortality\n the mystery as yama told nachiketa even those powerful beings that control the forces of the cosmos have been puzzled by the mystery of whether those who have gone beyond death can be said to exist or not to exist\n reflective human beings have agonized over the same problem\n when they came to buddha with the question he refused to give any answer saying that whichever he told them they would misunderstand and distort his words\n so he said nothing\n consequently to say that buddha taught the non existence of an immortal self and individual immortality is perhaps an even worse distortion than that which he sought to avoid through silence\n yama however was not talking to word juggling ignoramuses but to an eminently qualified inquirer\n yet testing the strength of nachiketa s interest in such a profound matter he attempted to dissuade him from pressing the question\n when that failed he resorted to that which has effectively deflected seekers through the history of humanity\n he offered him long lived and prosperous progeny vast material wealth and possessions unlimited pleasure and unlimited power and finally dominion over even the subtle worlds and all that is therein\n throughout countless ages the mere promise or prospect of such acquisitions have turned awakening consciousnesses from the path of immortality and led them further into the morass of mortal life\n but nachiketa could not be moved from his original resolve to learn the truth regarding immortality\n the katha upanishad cannot have been unknown to jesus when he lived and studied in india and it can be speculated that it was in the context of the teachings of this upanishad that he asked his disciples what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul i have to admit that when as a primary grade schooler i first heard this verse read out in church i immediately yought no\n the real question is what will a man take in exchange for his soul through the years i kept questioning as to whether things were a blessing for life or a bribe to embrace inner death\n this too we see so often\n from those early years and even till now i have seen so many bribes offered and taken all of them cheap and paltry compared to what the seekers would have gained if they had turned away from the offers\n and as i have pointed out in every instance the promise was withdrawn unfulfilled or the gain was ruthlessly wrested from their grasp and they were left broken and empty\n people do not need to die to become lost souls\n the suffering may not be eternal but it is no less terrible for that\n i can truthfully say that throughout my life the most desolate souls i have met were those that said to me with sad nostalgia i used to be and then mentioned some abandoned spiritual calling or involvement\n the wheels of life were grinding them down and tormenting them with the bitter memory of their loss along with the impossibility of their regaining that which they had so carelessly and foolishly tossed aside for life long ago\n let us attend in eastern christian worship the exclamation let us attend is usually uttered before some special reading or prayer is about to be intoned\n we should indeed attend to the words of nachiketa when he replied to yama s offer these things endure only till the morrow o destroyer of life and the pleasures they give wear out the senses\n keep you therefore horses and chariots keep dance and song for yourself\n how shall he desire wealth o death who once has seen your face nay only the boon that i have chosen that only do i ask\n having found out the society of the imperishable and the immortal as in knowing you i have done how shall i subject to decay and death and knowing well the vanity of the flesh how shall i wish for long life tell me o king the supreme secret regarding which men doubt\n no other boon will i ask\n in christianity and buddhism a great deal of emphasis is placed on the memory of death as a universal principle and the particular mortality of each one of us\n in the west this is superficially shrugged off as morbidity and unhealyour but it can be salutary indeed\n it was only sensible that nachiketa having come face to face with death should disregard all that which the human race has been madly seeking throughout its existence\n for in the east including christianity only that which lasts forever wiyout any change is considered real\n everything else is unreal illusory\n therefore that which can change and pass away is even now essentially nothing\n who then would value any such there is no need for a lengyour philosophical analysis of psychic niceties or suchlike\n the fact of their evanescent nature turns all desired objects to mere fantasies in the consciousness of the wise\n whereupon the king of death well pleased at heart began to teach nachiketa the secret of immortality\n the good and the pleasant the good is one thing the pleasant is another\n these two differing in their ends both prompt to action\n blessed are they that choose the good they that choose the pleasant miss the goal\n how simple and direct these words are when after years of being soaked sometimes drowned in mere religion when i found dharma one of the most beautiful and wonderful things about it was its incredible simplicity\n the religion i had had before was simplistic childishly so but at the same time it was complex convoluted and tangled because that was state of mind that had produced it and which it produced in those unfortunate enough to accept and follow it\n many avoided the problem by professing the religion but not really following it\n in contrast the profound dharma was also as simple as the great ocean gathering all into unity\n i had tried reading western philosophers and theologians and found them impossible to understand mostly because they were not really saying anything\n the first time i opened a book by shankara the greatest philosopher india has ever produced it was with real anxiety\n would i break apart on the rock of his verbiage not at all\n every sentence was so exquisitely clear every concept so unbelievably simple and equally vast and deep\n i understood why shankara knew by his acquisition of divine consciousness\n when shankara talked to me god was speaking\n and god knows how to communicate\n neither shankara nor the upanishads or the gita really require a commentary\n all a commentator can really do is expand what is already there so we do not rush from point to point in the original text and miss so much of it\n actually all my commentaries are really pauses and reflections\n there is no need to explain to you what those sacred texts mean\n you can easily understand them for yourself\n so all i am really doing is ruminating over them with you\n we are digesting them together\n it is very sait isfying\n at least to me i hope it is to you also\n the good and the pleasant the good is one thing the pleasant is another\n this does not have to be the situation the problem is in us\n since the good dissolves the ego and frees us from its seemingly eternal domination and bondage it is only natural that those who are inured even addicted to its rule will find the good bitter in the extreme\n in the closing chapter of the bhagavad gita krishna speaks of the one who chooses the good deep his delight after strict self schooling sour toil at first but at last what sweetness the end of sorrow\n who would not choose this just about everybody\n why because it requires strict selfschooling\n we have to educate and deliver ourselves\n neither god nor any holy being can do it for us\n therefore those who cling to their ego addiction avidly take refuge in and surrender to and place all my trust in god gods gurus saints teachers a religion and whatever knowing at least subconsciously that it will not work for they alone can do the needful\n the holy ones have already done all they could do for them\n they have given the message and pointed out the way\n now it is their turn to get to work\n otherwise nothing will happen\n and in their perversity this sait isfies them completely yough they cover it up with religiosity and devotion\n those who do wish to achieve the good must shake off their self hypnosis and begin the labor\n they will be surprised at how pleasant it really is and in time will come to realize that they were enjoying pain and avoiding the real pleasure that is found only in spiritual life\n krishna describes the pleasant as essentially sweet at first but at last how bitter that pleasure is poison\n it is not just harmful it is deadly\n saint ignatius of antioch a disciple of saint john the evangelist wrote of those who drinking a sweet drink that contains poison sweetly drink in their death\n aren t we having fun come on live what are you afraid of why don t you find out what it is all about what do you know about life these are the desperate appeals of those whose consciousness is awakened enough for them to be tormented by the example of those who have more fully awakened and who touch not the cup it is death to the soul\n the wise know that the good and the pleasant utterly differ in their ends\n the pleasant leads to ever more addiction a craving for ever increasing intoxication and finally complete collapse and destruction\n when senses touch objects the pleasures therefrom are like wombs that bear sorrow\nthey begin they are ended\n they bring no delight to the wise\n on the other hand self controlled cut free from desire curbing the heart and knowing the atman man finds nirvana that is in brahman here and hereafter\n for when a man s heart has reached fulfillment through knowledge and personal experience of the truth of brahman he is never again moved by the things of the senses\n earth stone and gold seem all alike to one who has mastered his senses\n such a yogi is said to have achieved union with brahman\n then he knows that infinite happiness which can be realized by the purified heart but is beyond the grasp of the senses\n he stands firm in this realization\n because of it he can never again wander from the inmost truth of his being\n the good also leads to complete collapse and destruction the collapse and disintegration of the ego and its attendants ignorance and desire\n then he knows bliss in the atman and wants nothing else\n cravings torment the heart he renounces cravings\n i call him illumined\n the man of faith whose heart is devoted whose senses are mastered he finds brahman\n enlightened he passes at once to the highest the peace beyond passion\n his mind is dead to the touch of the external it is alive to the bliss of the atman\n because his heart knows brahman his happiness is for ever\n already here on earth before his departure let man be the master of every impulse lust begotten or fathered by anger thus he finds brahman thus he is happy\n motivating forces these two differing in their ends both prompt to action\n both the good and the pleasant impel us to actions but they do so in completely different ways\n the good points us to the way of benefit in a completely intelligent and non emotional way\n for example the good never motivates us by selfish means such as promising reward or threatening punishment this is the way of evil including much of religion\n the good motivates us toward itself simply by revealing its inherent value\n the pleasant is altogether different\n it only shows us its external appearance\n it does not reason with us but entices or even compels us to seize it\n the pleasant only shows us its immediate or short term effect but completely hides from us its long term effects and blinds us to its inherent defects\n the archetypal example of this is found in the bible\n there we are told that when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat\n here we see all the problems with the pleasant only the external is considered emotion and instinct come to dominate and eclipse reason and the ultimate effect is completely unapparent\n in sum the good reveals but the pleasant conceals\n it is necessary that we see the good as truly good and the pleasant as harmful and even evil\n this is not easy\n the bigger picture one of the problems with prevailing religion of all kinds is its incredible small sightedness\n like the pleasant oriented and pleasant obsessed ego which it supports and feeds it is concerned with only the moment at hand or with goals that are utterly irrelevant to the real nature of the human being\n when we understand who what we really are then alone can we comprehend what is the sole purpose of our existence conscious union with the absolute\n in light of this the upanishad concludes blessed are they that choose the good they that choose the pleasant miss the goal\n so the discrimination between the good and the pleasant is no light matter\n a genuine test of character in the twenty fifth chapter of the gospel of matthew we find a parable about foolish and wise souls\n most of us do not really care if we are foolish just as long as no one labels us so\n but we should care and so the upanishad continues its teaching saying both the good and the pleasant present themselves to men\n the wise having examined both distinguish the one from the other\n the wise prefer the good to the pleasant the foolish driven by fleshly desires prefer the pleasant to the good\n there is a lot of truth in these few lines some of it embarrassing but nevertheless beneficial for us\n the good is not the pleasant even in philosophy\n both the good and the pleasant present themselves to men\n whatever may be the excuses we may make for ourselves even portraying ourselves as weak or victims no one no one forces anything upon us in life however much it may seem otherwise\n rather the good and the pleasant simply present themselves to us\n we are totally responsible for our response to them alyough like adam and eve back in genesis we try to put the blame on someone else on some external factor\n it is really essential to us as we move through life hopefully forward that alyough our deluded experience seems just the opposite in reality all things are completely neutral it is our response to them that really gives them any character such as good bad destructive positive etc\n a little yought will show this\n the deadliest poison is harmless if we do not make contact with it\n conversely the best medicine is worthless if we do not consume it\n or think of this garbage seems heavenly food to a starving person but not to someone who is well fed a child s toy means nothing to a mature adult\n nothing has an innate ability to draw or force us all the drawing and forcing is in our own mind as it responds to the object\n we can blame no one at any time\n it is all in us\n if there are no grass seeds in the soil no grass will grow\n the seeds have to be in us to sprout and grow and bear fruit as thinking willing and acting\n the wise having examined both distinguish the one from the other\n viveka the ability to distinguish between the real and the unreal between the true and the false between the transient and the permanent is indispensable for the serious spiritual aspirant\n the wise possess and exercise this faculty the eye of wisdom by deeply examining whatever is presented to them and discerning whether it is the good or the merely pleasant they are being confronted with\n intelligence comes into the foreground feeling and emotion being banished from the mental field altogether\n human beings operate either rationally or instinctually emotionally\n the wise are rational at all times\n for example real love is clearsighted never blind whereas infatuation masquerading as love is both blinding and blindness\n preferring and driven if two people are walking one toward the north and the other toward the south the difference between them is very little just the direction they are facing\n but in the matter of the wise and the foolish the differences are profound for they are rooted in their very being especially the mind and intellect\n even as a child i always yought that the statement of abraham to lazarus that between us and you there is a great gulf fixed was spiritually symbolic that a great gulf did indeed lie between the godwards and the earthwards\n the upanishad is outlining this nature of this gulf for us by describing its effects on both\n the wise prefer the good they are not enticed coerced or somehow drawn to the good\n they intelligently yes intellectually prefer it because they know its nature and its effects\n this is true of everything in their life mundane mental and spiritual\n this is markedly true in the matter of religion\n the religious expression of the wise is always peaceful clear intelligent informed and practical it works\n the foolish however are not so\n they truly are a troubled sea tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind as isaiah and saint paul observed\n driven by fleshly desires it only follows that they prefer the pleasant to the good for the flesh cannot even perceive the good to any appreciable degree but they create a lot of illusions about it all negative and self assuring\n their religion is subhuman of course catering to their emotions and their demands for the indulgence of their whims and vices\n however educated they may be or how boring and dry their church services still animality reigns and all manner of subhuman behavior is sanctioned and even elevated and spiritualized\n wallowing in the sty of their comforting and indulgent religion they cast many a contemptuous and secretly guilty glance at those who are not so and create many a bon mot about their unnatural denial and repressions hinting of sinister implications for those who run away from life and refuse to face themselves and expect too much from themselves and others\n but they are still only talking pigs\n even yough they like to say they are only human and that god understands they are\n driven by pleasure pain their humanity becomes submerged in the animality impressed in their subconscious by millions of incarnations in subhuman forms\n merely possessing a human body is no guarantee of humanity\n bronner in a conversation with one of the monks of our ashram referred to some people as not yet human he was right\n a house does not make a home and a human body does not make a human\n humanity only dawns when intelligence dominates and wisdom is gained\n we need not be intellectual in the academic sense but we must be intelligent\n then if we use our intelligence there is a chance we may become wise and thereby cross the great gulf\n the plain facts chances are nachiketa never got voted most popular of anything and may not even have been a good mixer\n but yama assessed him quite highly saying thou o nachiketa having looked upon fleshly desires delightful to the senses hast renounced them all\n thou hast turned from the miry way wherein many a man wallows\n now this is a thumbnail portrait of a wise human being but it is a test of the wise and the foolish\n the wise will accept it and the foolish will not\n so we should take a square look at it and our reaction will tell us which we are\n first of all nachiketa is not naive or innocent\n he knows what is going on even if most things should not be going on\n he has not turned away but has deeply looked into the desires of the flesh and the delights of the senses\n he knows what the fake life of the foolish is all about and he has renounced it all not just a little bit or even most but the whole mess\n why because he does not identify with the flesh and the senses but with the intelligence and his true self that is pure consciousness\n he knows he is not the perishable body\n thou hast turned from the miry way wherein many a man wallows says yama\n nachiketa sees that the world of body sense enslavement is a suffocating bog not just ugly and repulsive to the wise but deadly\n he knows with jesus that ye cannot serve god and mammon\n he also knows that in reality once a person has reached the level of human evolution he cannot really live like an animal wiyout dire consequences including terrible suffering\n as humans we have simply gone beyond that to which the foolish cling to so obsessively\n this is strikingly illustrated in jesus parable of the prodigal son found in the fifteenth chapter of saint luke\n after wasting his inheritance the man hired himself out to a pig farmer\n this is a symbol of someone who has enslaved himself to the lower nature and the senses pigs that wallow in filth eat garbage and demand more\n and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him\n like nearly all of us the poor soul wants to feed on and be sait isfied with the garbage that the pigs revel in grunting this is living but it cannot be we are not pigs we are not the senses or the body\n no matter how much we desire to regress to animal living we cannot really do so\n and usually only pain will wake us up from such folly\n when we do wake up like the prodigal we will resolve i will arise and go forward in the path of evolution leaving the sty and its pigs behind\n the rising and the going will not be easy but there simply is nothing else for a true human being to do\n moreover the path will not be long yough it may seem so for time drags when we are having struggle and pain\n jesus indicates this saying when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him\n all the perfected souls that have taught us about spiritual life have assured us that the effort required of us is but a token nevertheless a token that must be paid\n if we can but get a glimpse or conceive a bit of what it will be to have arisen and travelled the way then the price will seem so small\n amazingly saint paul tells us that jesus for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god\n just think the joy\n this should be our perspective too\n again renunciation is the way of immortality\n the way of ignorance the two ways yama the king of death praises nachiketa saying far from each other and leading to different ends are ignorance and knowledge\n thee o nachiketa i regard as one who aspires after knowledge for a multitude of pleasant objects were unable to tempt you\n it is interesting to note that the concept of two ways of human life are to be found in all religious traditions\n jesus spoke of the broad way and the strait way and when they met in jerusalem and issued a joint spiritual letter his apostles began by saying there are two ways in this world\n long before that the katha upanishad spoke of the way of ignorance and the way of knowledge\n the way of ignorance is the subject of the three verses we will be considering but first yama tells us the key trait of one who aspires to knowledge he cannot be tempted by the pleasant\n this is because he sees its nature and its results\n the pursuers of the way of ignorance are not such as nachiketa and yama now tells us about them and the results of their walking in that way\n the way of folly living in the abyss of ignorance yet wise in their own conceit deluded fools go round and round the blind led by the blind\n that certainly is plain speaking let us go through this verse bit by bit\n living in the abyss of ignorance\n this word abyss is very disturbing in this context\n it indicates that the condition of ignorance is profound not something than can easily be removed or escaped\n rather the person is sunk deep into the darkness of ignorance so deep that he cannot see anything but darkness so deep that he can hardly be extricated from it at least in this life\n it is not that his condition is utterly hopeless but that he simply has neither awareness nor interest\n if that dawns he is on his way out of the abyss\n but most of the time it does not happen\n in a routine of the firesign theatre a disease is described with the concluding words the only cure for which is death\n in many actually most cases of abysmal ignorance this is the truth\n the individual requires another birth before he can arise from the depths\n until then he should be left alone\n yet wise in their own conceit\n somewhere i read the words the problem with ignorance is that it picks up confidence as it goes along\n since ignorance is a by product of ego as ignorance increases so does egoit ism\n increasing in this alternating cycle invincible arrogance and invincible ignorance arise take hold and consume the ignorant person\n this is really an ugly picture but an accurate one\n thinking themselves wise how can the ignorant ever see the truth about themselves both the higher and the lower selves and try to rectify themselves they cannot\n not content to revel in their private kingdom of ignorance they then set about to aggressively expand it through influence of others\n and if they cannot influence they will dominate and bully until they have extended their sphere of darkness\n again ugly but accurate\n living in the fantasy land of ego they sink deeper believing that they are rising\n deluded fools go round and round\n cycling in confusion the foolish spiral downward seeming to go up and down but really only going down and down\n in their minds they veer back and forth up and down agitating themselves and others but in actuality they just keep on sinking\n because of this they continually go round and round in the wheel of birth and death perpetually bound to the torture wheel of samsara and reveling in every moment\n they have discovered the secret of happiness in this world unconsciousness\n the blind led by the blind\n ignorance as well as misery loves company in fact needs it desperately and thrives on it\n supporting each other they stumble through this world until death claims them and they get to do it all over and over and over\n when they are not being the leader and the led they are the pusher and the pushed the dominating and the dominated the victimizer and the victim alternating in these two roles they reel onward and downward\n blind to eternity to the youghtless youth deceived by the vanity of earthly possessions the path that leads to the eternal abode is not revealed\n this world alone is real there is no hereafter thinking thus he falls again and again birth after birth into my jaws\n rendered heedless of the truth about his condition through involvement with materiality both his body and objects in the world and deluded by what he thinks is going on the ignorant never sees the way beyond the abyss in which he dwells\n he simply cannot see it just as we cannot hear frequencies beyond the range of our hearing or see things beyond the range of our sight\n he is deaf and blind to spirit in all its aspects\n even if by some chance he should seek the way if he finds it he will not know it nor if he come face to face with the way will he realize it\n he will despise and deny it even denouncing it as delusive or evil\n on the other hand he will exult in devilish religion teachers and practices seeking them out and devoting himself to them\n let me give two examples i know of personally\n a great master used to plead with a young man to learn meditation assuring him that his progress would be rapid and he would be liberated in this life\n but he did not get initiated\n when the master was about to leave his body he told his disciples that if the man ever came to the ashram and expressed an interest one of them was to initiate him immediately\n but a dozen or so years later one of the biggest frauds the yoga world has ever produced came to town charging money for a worthless technique\n the man was in poor financial condition and could not really afford it but he immediately slapped down the cash and got initiated into nothing\n two buddhist friends of mine visit a prison and instruct the inmates in buddhist philosophy and spiritual practice\n they are practicers of the pure land school of buddhism\n whenever they try to get the prisoners to chant the liberating name of amida buddha they refuse and insist that they chant tibetan power mantras instead\n they love bondage and lust after control\n they belong where they are\n this world alone is real there is no hereafter is yought by many of the foolish but there are many more who do not actually think it but live as yough they did\n denial of spiritual realities is done more by deeds than by words\n it does not matter how devoutly or spiritually we may think if we live carelessly and materially as centered on our ego as any ignoramus we would regard as unspiritual\n this is the real test\n thinking the material world alone is real the ignorant return to it again and again living in the jaws of death\n if we do the same then we are fools\n if we do not then we are wise\n the mystery of the self seeing is not always seeing and hearing is not always hearing\n in some instances it is misperception and in others it is no perception at all\n this is illustrated by an incident from the life of jesus\n while speaking to the people he prayed father glorify your name\n then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again\n the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel speak to him\n four levels of perception are manifested here\n one level knew that god had spoken another yought that an angel had spoken another yought it had only thundered and the fourth did not hear a thing\n as a rule phenomena can be classified in fours\n the four castes spoken of in indian scriptures are not social strata based on physical birth but four levels of awareness in fact they correspond to the four responses to the speaking of god that saint john has recorded in this gospel passage\n krishna follows the same classification in the bhagavad gita saying there are some who have actually looked upon the atman and understood it in all its wonder\n others can only speak of it as wonderful beyond their understanding\n others know of its wonder by hearsay\n and there are others who are told about it and do not understand a word\n but it is the katha upanishad we are looking into at the moment so let us see what yama had to say to nachiketa about this matter of understanding the self atman \n to many it is not given to hear of the self\n many yough they hear of it do not understand it\n wonderful is he who speaks of it\n intelligent is he who learns of it\n blessed is he who taught by a good teacher is able to understand it\n the silent majority to many it is not given to hear of the self\n most people by far the most people have never heard of the self and never will in this lifetime\n oh yes they will hear about an immortal soul spirit that a tyrannical god will reward or punish according to his whim but the real nature of that spirit as part of and therefore one with the supreme reality and therefore supreme reality itself eternal immortal and indivisible will never be even hinted at nor will they come up with the concept on their own\n further it will not be even suggested to them either from within or wiyout that the spirit nature is the self nothing more and is the only true identity they can ever have\n being unchanging this self cannot be affected or changed by anything no not even by god\n it is what it is just as much as god is what he is\n it is therefore not only the most worthwhile thing for us to get involved with it is the only thing we can possibly be involved with\n everything else is illusion\n this glorious truth of the self known only to the seers of sanatana dharma there are others in various religions that hold this but they are looked upon as mavericks and heretics by those groups must be the sole perspective in which we view our present situation as consciousnesses experiencing the process of evolution\n it is the ever shifting dance of prakriti to which we have become attached that evolves we are ever the same ever the one\n living in the silence of ignorance what can they do not much obviously\n the uncomprehending many yough they hear of it do not understand it\n this is true of many who yough ostensibly adherents to sanatana dharma really do not get the idea especially about the self\n these are those that frequent temples ashrams and saints as a kind of insurance against calamity and trouble\n then there are those that only run to those holy places when problems arise\n obviously they have no degree of comprehension regarding the self\n neither do most who profess to understand the self\n this is seen by their words and deeds\n if someone believes the building is on fire we can tell it by their attempts to get out\n similarly if someone believes in the truth about the self they will order their entire lives accordingly not just assent to the concept\n to know the self to enter into the fullness of its consciousness and being will be the focus of their life and yought\n sri ramakrishna often said that if a thief learned of a great treasure being kept in the room next to where he was living he would not be able to sleep for thinking about how to break through the wall and get it\n in the same way those who really understand about the wonder of the self will not rest until they have re claimed the treasure for themselves\n spiritual purification and spiritual practice are the means for breaking through the wall and claiming the prize\n we have a dilemma here also only those who understand about the self will be motivated to engage in tapasya to realize it fully yet only those who are engaged in tapasya can have any glimmer of the self and be motivated to practice the solution lies in the fact that in time the self begins to urge us to its realization that we will intuit the presence of the self and start moving toward the point where when we hear about it we will accept and act upon what we hear\n it is interesting to see that yama does not mention those who reject or deny the truth of the self\n apparently to him they do not even exist\n wonderful we joke sometimes about the exaggerations of the theatrical and motion picture industries\n it is colossal magnificent the greatest ever and suchlike continually pour out in conversation and adverit isements\n the song hollywood assures us that out there you re terrific if you re good\n divinity on the other hand has a somewhat different viewpoint so yama tells nachiketa wonderful is he who speaks of it\n he is not speaking of a parrot a spiritual phonograph but of one who speaks with awakened awareness even if not from perfect knowledge or realization\n for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speak\n the implication here is that we should seek out and only listen to those who speak of the self from the self and in the perspective of the self\n theology is usually only so much distracting noise and so is most religious and spiritual talk\n buddha likened a true teacher or teaching to a finger pointing at the moon only that which points us to our own reality is itself real and worthwhile\n such a teacher or teaching is wonderful indeed\n intelligent the word stupid gets tossed about in casual conversation as much as does wonderful and no one relishes being yought stupid\n few care whether they actually are stupid just as long as nobody notices or points it out\n yama with his very definite perspective assures nachiketa that the intelligent person is the one who pursues knowledge of the self\n this is done in two ways listening to or reading the teachings about the self of those who have themselves known the self and most importantly by actively seeking to know one s own self through careful analysis swadhyaya and spiritual practices most especially meditation\n this latter point is very necessary for us to grasp\n intellectually intelligent people love learning and they should\n however it is easy to fall into the trap of studying all the theory and not getting down to any practice to determine the validity of the theory\n saint silouan of athos said that delight in the study of theology was the false mysticism of the ego\n when swami turiyananda first met sri ramakrishna he was intensely studying vedanta for at least six hours a day\n upon hearing of this sri ramakrishna was astounded\n what else does vedanta say except that brahman alone is real the world is illusory and the self and brahman are one he asked\n so why do you need six hours of study for that turiyananda had the good sense to understand and began to devote himself to japa and meditation in order to know the self not just know about the self\n in the west it is a common error to assume that knowing about something is the same thing as knowing it\n more than once i have read in catechisms that knowing god is accomplished by reading the catechism that is stupid\n blessed to be wonderful and intelligent is good but to be blessed is the ideal\n so yama concludes blessed is he who taught by a good teacher is able to understand it\n this is because a good teacher does not just impart theoretical knowledge but reveals to the student the practical means by which he can open his understanding through meditation to behold and know the self\n krishna being the supreme teacher instructs arjuna in the gita about meditation saying if he practices meditation in this manner his heart will become pure\n he must be united constantly with me in his meditation\n the practice of serenity sympayour meditation upon the atman withdrawal of the mind from sense objects and integrity of motive is called austerity of the mind\n make a habit of practicing meditation and do not let your mind be distracted\n in this way you will come finally to the lord who is the light giver the highest of the high\n how to either know or not know the self let the student who is often a buyer beware the truth of the self cannot be fully understood when taught by an ignorant man for opinions regarding it not founded in knowledge vary one from another\n subtler than the subtlest is this self and beyond all logic\n taught by a teacher who knows the self and brahman as one a man leaves vain theory behind and attains to truth\n by the truth of the self is meant both the philosophical scriptural truth and the direct perception of the truth experienced in meditation\n however yama is at this point speaking more on the side of learning the intellectual truth about the self its nature and its possibility of realization\n we all know the incredible and impenetrable tangle of theologies that constitute what most people think are the religions of the world\n the reason for this is simple most almost all teachers of religion are fundamentally ignorant\n ignorant not in the intellectual sense but in the intuitive sense\n since we do need an intellectual road map to help us in our search for direct experience of the self this is a serious matter\n for an attempt to figure out the truth of the self in a purely theoretical manner will only add to the prevailing confusion\n we will just become one more voice in the cacophony of ignorant religion or philosophy\n nothing is worse than an ignoramus that believes he has an inside track\n as jesus observed if the light that is in you be actually darkness how great is that darkness consequently it is a most detrimental thing to come into the orbit of an ignorant teacher and accept his words and even worse to act on them\n some years back there was a most interesting motion picture called apprentice to murder\n it was based on the actual experience of a man who as an adolescent came into contact with a wise man in the southern hills\n this man conducted a kind of church whose members studied a nineteenth century book of what might be called folk magic\n he had genuine psychic abilities and really did work miracles\n this boy became his student and ended up being jailed as an accomplice in the man s murder of someone he considered a black magician\n this is a rather drastic example but frankly it is much less destructive in the long run than involvement with many contemporary teachers some of the worst of whom are in the yoga world\n to be confused is worse than being merely ignorant and being flawed and distorted by wrong yoga practices is even worse\n beyond the intellect subtler than the subtlest is this self and beyond all logic says yama\n being subtler than the subtlest the self cannot possibly be perceived by any sense including those of the subtle bodies or conceived of by even the highest and subtle reaches of the intellect\n yet the self can be known\n this is possible only when taught by a teacher who knows the self and brahman as one a man leaves vain theory behind and attains to truth through the practice of meditation instruction in which a qualified teacher will give\n this really marks out the knowledgous teacher from the ignorant teacher\n the ignorant teacher will only expound theory proving what he teaches by intellectual means\n the woryour teacher may say much the same words but will point the student to the means by which he can attain the vision of the self\n he will establish the student in the practice of correct meditation wiyout which nothing that is real can possibly be known\n yama tells us that the teacher should be one who knows not a rhetorician or theoretician\n now it is impossible for us to look into the consciousness of a teacher so how will we know he has real knowledge we cannot in an absolute sense but yama gives us a trait that at least assures us the teacher is not altogether astray he will affirm the oneness of the self and brahman\n no matter how cleverly convincingly and cutely he may speak however much he may appeal to our emotions and deluded intellects if he does not insist on the unity of the self and brahman saying with the chandogya upanishad that thou art he is unworyour and to be turned away from\n unhappily there are a lot of ignoramuses who appeal to egoit istical fools by saying you are god\n the true teacher says not that we are god but that god is us\n there is an infinite difference\n furthermore the real teacher does not just tell us this fact he instructs in the means to find it out for ourself\n these two traits must be present before we even begin to think about accepting a teacher as a valid guide\n the ultimate test of a teacher is our own capacity made accessible to us by his instruction to leave all speculation behind and enter into the reality that is both brahman and the self while remaining ever one\n then all the gods and sages will say of us what yama said of nachiketa the awakening which you hast known does not come through the intellect but rather in fullest measure from the lips of the wise\n beloved nachiketa blessed blessed art you because you seekest the eternal\n would that i had more pupils like you from the unreal to the real eternal values there is an obscure protestant song entitled with eternity s values in view\n musically it is not much but philosophically it is profound\n we are not temporal mortal beings and if we live our life as yough we were then only confusion and chaos can result\n instead we must see ourselves as eternal beings presently dreaming the dream of evolution a dream whose culmination is awakening toward which all of our attention and awareness should be focused\n nachiketa knew this but yama underlined it telling him well i know that earthly treasure lasts but till the morrow\n for did not i myself wishing to be king of death make sacrifice with fire but the sacrifice was a fleeting thing performed with fleeting objects and small is my reward seeing that only for a moment will my reign endure\n what are a billion years compared to eternity not even a glimmer\n why then do we scramble after such short lived earthly goals goals that even if attained prove to be worthless since they vanish away so quickly why do we continually deny our eternity and affirm the delusion of temporality because we identify thoroughly with that which is temporal and finite\n buddha and two fools buddha once encountered two deluded ascetics\n one always behaved like a dog and the other like a water buffalo\n no explanation is given for their behavior\n perhaps it related to some deity worshipped by them\n for example a dog would be related to bhairava a form of shiva and a water buffalo to the goddess durga\n however it might be they wanted to know from buddha what the results of their way of life would be\n he refused to answer but they kept insisting so he told them plainly that if they were lucky they would be reborn as a dog and a water buffalo and if they were unlucky they would find themselves in astral hells corresponding to their aberrative life and yought\n as anticipated by buddha they wailed and fussed and went away wiyout gaining any sense or rectifying their foolish ways\n we are just like them except we are hypocrites claiming to believe in the eternal unconditioned self and acting just the opposite\n the dilemma of the gods it is true that there is nothing on this earth we cannot attain if we put forth the effort\n in previous creations human beings performed elaborate rituals to become gods in this creation including brahma the creator\n they succeeded and the result was that they suffer more pain and anxiety than human beings do and are more subject to mental aberrations than humans\n furthermore they are bound until the end of this creation cycle to fulfil their offices and can in no way shirk or abandon them\n so they are more bound than any human being could ever be\n in other words their heaven has turned out to be a hell\n still their main anxiety is fear over falling from their exalted status and returning to human form\n they have learned nothing from their experience\n do we a metaphysical fact but the sacrifice was a fleeting thing performed with fleeting objects and small is my reward seeing that only for a moment will my reign endure\n within this lament of yama is embedded a profound truth regarding spiritual life\n only the spirit is eternal and everlasting\n everything else however highly evolved or sacred is temporal and impermanent\n however long lived they may be in time they will dissolve back into the primal energy of manifestation and we will lose them never really having had them at all\n consequently the wise seek only for the eternal spirit yough using the material and the temporal to aid them in their search\n for example physical health is not enlightenment but it certainly makes the enlightenment process easier\n material sufficiency relieves us from anxiety and helps us pursue spiritual life wiyout distraction\n discipline is essential for material life and even more so for spiritual life\n yet discipline will not take us to the goal it will greatly facilitate our going but we must never mistake proficiency in any discipline or practice for spiritual attainment\n in the same way any type of yogic practice that does not deal directly with consciousness will not result in enlightenment\n like discipline it may help us in our ascent to higher awareness but it must not be mistaken for that awareness\n sadhana means spiritual practice that leads to the revelation of the real sat \n the temporal does not lead to the eternal therefore real sadhana must begin and end in spirit consciousness\n no material procedure is sadhana nor is any externally oriented practice sadhana\n the only true sadhana is the turning inward of the mind and the perception of the inmost spirit\n in other words meditation alone is sadhana meditation free of all mechanics and gimmicks simple and direct leading to the ultimate simplicity that is the self\n we must begin with spirit if we are to end with spirit\n that is why patanjali briefly outlines the nature of god telling us that his manifesting word is om and concluding its japa and meditation is the way\n for constant japa meditation utilizing the eternal om will render us an infinite reward\n in just a few more verses the katha upanishad encapsulates it thus of that goal which all the vedas declare which is implicit in all penances and in pursuit of which men lead lives of continence and service of that will i briefly speak\n this syllable is brahman\n this syllable is indeed supreme\n he who knows it obtains his desire\n it is the strongest support\n it is the highest symbol\n he who knows it is reverenced as a knower of brahman\n the truth all truth is a two edged sword\n it tells us what is and what is not\n the truth about the self and brahman also tells us what is not the self or brahman\n those of us who are clinging to the unreal will find this painful or at least uncomfortable\n but we have to let go of the unreal to lay hold of the real\n if we do not like this fact we need not bother with real but keep on whirling around in our little hamster wheel we call life\n but the wise listen and act upon yama s next words to nachiketa the goal of worldly desire the glittering objects for which all men long the celestial pleasures they hope to gain by religious rites the most sought after of miraculous powers all these were within your grasp\n but all these with firm resolve you hast renounced\n to enter into life we turn away from all fulfillments of material and temporal desires no longer attracted by their false glitter\n nor do we aspire to some heaven or heavenly pleasures offered to us by ego oriented religion things that also end as painfully as the joys of earth\n even miracles mean nothing to us for they occur only in the realm of duality the realm of death\n where is life seeing that nachiketa was yearning to pass from death to immortality yama continues the ancient effulgent being the indwelling spirit subtle deep hidden in the lotus of the heart is hard to know\n but the wise man following the path of meditation knows him and is freed alike from pleasure and from pain\n first of all before analyzing this it must be realized that yama is talking about us\n certainly we are finite and god is infinite but substantially essentially we are the same\n so yama is talking about our true nature in these amazing words and we should consider them accordingly\n ancient we are puranam ancient\n god is called the purana purusha the ancient person\n since we coexist with him we too are ancient\n shankara in his commentary explains that in this context puranam does not just mean incredibly old but everlasting\n that is we too are primeval beings\n there was never a time when i did not exist nor you nor any of these kings\n nor is there any future in which we shall cease to be krishna tells arjuna in the gita\n our eternity is very hard for us to grasp even theoretically because we have been caught in the timespace web for ages beyond calculation\n creations have come and gone as we barely crawled along the evolutionary path\n we just cannot conceive of eternity for it is not time wiyout end it is that state of being which lies beyond time\n actually we are living in that state right now but have completely lost sight of it and imagine we are immersed in the sea of constant change of constant birth and death with their attendant sufferings\n to view ourselves as eternal immortal beings is therefore most important for wiyout that perspective life will totally overwhelm us drowning us in illusions wiyout either numbering or end\n yet when we step back withdrawing our consciousness into our own reality it will end instantly\n it is the stepping back and withdrawal that takes the time\n effulgent being devam means shining one\n we are ourselves the light that shines in darkness for we are a living part of the light of life\n consequently we must turn within for illumination\n until we are perfected in that in turning we do need some external lights such as holy books and teachers but it is unwise to become dependent on any outer source of knowledge\n eventually we must get it all from within having become swayamprakash self illumined\n certainly we should be discontented with our present ignorant and bound state of being but there is no room here for condemning or loathing ourselves for being sinners weak foolish etc\n our discontent with our present state should arise from our conviction that we are ourselves divine for devam means that as well\n we are living far beneath our selves\n knowing that we should turn around stop our descent and begin ascending to our real place far beyond any childish heaven or relative condition of any type however exalted\n since we are self effulgent all guidance must eventually come from within\n we may not be able to tap the inner light right now to the needed degree but in time our atma alone must be our guide through and beyond this life\n we must learn to rely on our capacity for pure knowing\n as a child and a young man i looked upon myself as a bible believing christian so naturally i believed that jesus christ was the light of the world\n but it was only when i found the wisdom of the upanishads that i really believed jesus when he said ye are the light of the world\n for the fundamental necessity is to realize that we are the light also\n god is light and so are we for we and god are one not two\n no one who claims to be spiritually enlightened can teach otherwise for with you is the fountain of life in your light shall we see light\n the light of god reveals the light of our own self\n the closer we get to our real self the closer we come to god and vice versa\n then the sun shall be no more your light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto you but the lord shall be unto you an everlasting light and your god your glory\n for we shall know ourselves as light and glory\n this is not egoit ism for in the light the ego melts away\n the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day\n indwelling spirit indwelling spirit not only tells us that we are pure consciousness by nature but the important fact that our consciousness is the noumenon which dwells at the heart of all phenomena\n that wherever there is any thing there are we as the reality that is the substratum of all existence even of illusion\n that is why we find our selves if we pierce the veil of illusion or look within\n subtle we do not perceive the self because our conditionings from aeons of relative existence has coarsened our perceptions\n experiencing materiality over and over and over again has oriented and confined our awareness to the grossest levels of existence\n further it has oriented and confined our awareness to externalities\n any reflective person can readily understand the need to turn our awareness inward to perceive the self but more is needed we must refine our minds rendering them more and more subtle so they can eventually see the most subtle the self\n meditation refines the mind no doubt but we have to do more than that otherwise an entire life will simply not be enough time to produce the requisite refinement\n therefore patanjali in yoga sutras lists the necessary means for the physical and psychic refinement wiyout which the self cannot be realized to any degree\n they are ahimsa non violence non injury harmlessness satya truthfulness honesty asteya non stealing honesty non misappropriativeness brahmacharya sexual continence in yought word and deed as well as control of all the senses aparigraha non possessiveness non greed non selfishness non acquisitiveness shaucha purity cleanliness santosha contentment peacefulness tapas austerity practical i\n result producing spiritual discipline swadhyaya introspective self study spiritual study ishwarapranidhana offering of one s life to god all of these deal with the innate powers of the human being or rather with the abstinence and observance that will develop and release those powers to be used toward our spiritual perfection to our self realization and liberation\n equally important is their effect on our minds harmonization strengthening and refinement\n these ten factors and successful meditation are actually interdependent\n wiyout meditation they are impossible to accomplish and wiyout their steady and complete observance meditation becomes impossible\n this is why after nearly forty years of the yoga boom in this country nothing significant has been accomplished spiritually\n a lot of money has been made organizations formed and exalted over the lives of their members and a great deal of folly and neurosis has resulted what to say of virulent scandals but that is all\n why because these ten needful elements are utterly omitted from the spheres of their existence\n they are never mentioned much less advocated\n the only exception is ahimsa limited only to opposition to war\n this is because everybody wants to be nice and the pop yoga movement was born during the hell no we won t go war protesting hip era\n however the most obvious personal application of ahimsa advocacy of abstention from the eating of animal flesh is usually absent\n the sensible aspirant cannot do otherwise than make these ten disciplines part of his life if he truly wishes to render himself capable of beholding the self and living as the self\n deep hidden in the lotus of the heart why are we out of touch with god and our self because we are skimming on the surface of things while reality is deep hidden in the lotus of the heart the core of all\n actually reality is deephidden in the core of the things we are experiencing\n we only need to see into them to find the true\n that is why in buddhism we find the word penetration so frequently used\n we must see deeply\n that is we need not turn away or withdraw from outer phenomena but rather develop the capacity to see into them to their ultimate depth\n to do this we do enter inside through meditation but since there really is neither inside nor outside in the truest sense in time through the practice of meditation we come to see all there is to see the one\n hard to know we have all experienced getting a mistaken idea or impression stuck in our head that we could not get rid of even when we knew better\n the same is true of habit patterns\n living in conditioned existence we ourselves have become conditioned or at least we identify with the conditionings of the ever shifting mind\n this is the only reason that the self is hard to know\n it has nothing to do with the nature of the self but with the conditioning of the mind conditioning resulting from billions and billions of lifetimes as everything from an atom of hydrogen onward to where we are now\n it is not easy to undo in a few years what we have taken yousands of creation cycles to build up yet it can be done and will be done in time\n we just have to understand the way things work and that it will take time\n nevertheless the words hard to know assure us that the self can be known\n the way and its effects but the wise man following the path of meditation knows him and is freed alike from pleasure and from pain\n it is the path of meditation that leads to self knowledge none other\n the uncontrolled mind does not guess that the atman is present how can it meditate wiyout meditation where is peace wiyout peace where is happiness it is not that self knowledge renders us incapable of experiencing pleasure or pain but of being in bondage to them that is being subject to reaction to pleasure and pain\n the bonds of his flesh are broken\n he is lucky and does not rejoice he is unlucky and does not weep\n i call him illumined\n to obey the atman is his peaceful joy sorrow melts into that clear peace his quiet mind is soon established in peace\n finding the treasure all the world seeks happiness\n our american declaration of independence says that the pursuit of happiness is an inalienable right for every human being\n but see how miserable people really are beneath the frantic veneer of the pursuit of happiness in an ever changing and pain producing world\n the problem we are looking in the wrong direction\n we are seeking outward when we should be seeking inward\n we are seeking the non self instead of the self\n from the katha upanishad we learn the right line of action\n the man who has learned that the self is separate from the body the senses and the mind and has fully known him the soul of truth the subtle principle such a man verily attains to him and is exceeding glad because he has found the source and dwelling place of all felicity\n truly do i believe o nachiketa that for you the gates of joy stand open\n separate the self is separate from the body the senses and the mind\n therefore the body senses and mind cannot even see the self as an object and certainly cannot possibly experience the self to any degree\n the happiness experienced by body senses and mind is not true happiness at all but an approximation a sham that distracts us from the real thing inevitably leading us to frustration and all around misery\n this must be learned\n then the self itself must be known\n soul of truth subtle principle the self is the very soul of truth of reality\n it is not just the basis of reality it is reality\n apart from it there simply is nothing\n it is subtle beyond all conception but not beyond all experience\n it is when we enter fully into the being that is the self that we attain to him that boundless happiness shall be ours\n for the boundless itself shall be ours\n source and dwelling yama then tells us an important fact the self is the source of all and the dwelling place of all felicity\n now this is most intriguing\n we are saying that the self is all there really is and then we hear that it is the source of all\n this is the key to true non dual comprehension\n sri ramakrishna explained that at first we follow the path of negation saying not this not that the idea being that everything we can see or think of is not the real\n but when we come to the real end of that approach which is not just intellection or mind gaming but the inner path of meditation and turn back we will say all this that is we will see that everything is the real that the unreal was only our way of seeing and mis understanding it\n the whole world said sri ramakrishna will then be seen as a mart of joy\n unless this is understood at the beginning we will end up being just another dyspeptic world and lifedenying grouch claiming that our dryness and grimness is jnana wisdom \n there is a state beyond bliss you know grated one of them to a friend of mine who dared to find joy in the self\n india abounds with these anatmic misfits and we have plenty of them in the west too\n one is too many\n all that is dwells in is rooted in the self and is therefore an expression of divine ananda\n what a wonderful world view one that sees not the world but spirit\n we do not go from one point to another to pass from the unreal to the real from darkness to the light from death to immortality\n it is only a matter of changing our base of perception\n this is the real alchemy changing the lead of mundane experience to the gold of supernal joy\n the conclusion no one is excluded from this glorious truth it extends to all and is vital to all in an equal degree\n no one is nearer or farer from the self it embraces all\n this is the real gospel the evangelion the good news humanity needs so desperately truly for you the gates of joy stand open\n let us pass through them the transcendent reality of the self previously yama has spoken to nachiketa of the manner to experience the self that is immanent in all that is\n now he completes the picture by an exposition of the transcendent and the means to realize it\n he does this in response to nachiketa s question teach me o king i beseech you whatsoever you knowest to be beyond right and wrong beyond cause and effect beyond past present and future\n he desires to know about the transcendental reality that is beyond all qualities or designations\n as the immanent being that has infinite names forms conditions and qualities but beyond that is something much greater the transcendent\n that can neither be said to exist or not to exist to be with form or wiyout form with qualities or wiyout qualities for all these propositions are dualities one presupposing the other\n where there is one there is its opposite duality is an absolute in the realm of the immanent reality\n nachiketa is certainly pleased with the truth that all can be seen as the divine unity but he wishes to complete his knowledge by learning about what lies beyond even that\n sri ma anandamayi when discussing these things always insisted on the point that there is a state in which even the question of duality unity form formless and such like cannot even arise\n that is the state nachiketa aspires to comprehend and experience\n the answer is in the question everything in manifestation is dual\n this is the truth for every aspect of life\n there is an interesting divinatory process known as the alphabet of the magi\n to work it a question is formulated and then written on cards one letter per card\n these cards are then shuffled and dealt out in a special way unknown to me to form the words that are the answer to the question it was the alphabet of the magi worked by a benedictine monk who practiced divination and astrology in paris after his monastery had been closed by the anti religious government that inspired charlotte corday to assassinate marat and inspired napoleon then a mere corporal to aspire to the rulership of france\n the idea that the answer is inherent in the question is very important for it means that the questioner already knows the answer on the subconscious or superconscious level that the question cannot arise until the answer is subliminally known\n the purpose of questioning then is to bring out on the conscious level what is known unconsciously\n when we seemingly ask another to teach us we are really seeking to stimulate and bring forth our own knowledge\n that is why the wise have assured their students that in time they would be able to find the answers within themselves it is only a matter of developing intuition through clarifying the mind\n it is very common to hear someone demand why did you ask me if you are not going to accept what i tell you the reply should be so i can figure the answer out for myself\n the very fact that we reject a given answer indicates that we think we do know what is the truth about the matter\n otherwise we would mindlessly accept what we are told\n many do alas\n it is all inside us\n questioning reveals the ripening of our innate knowledge\n knowing this jesus said ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened\n he is not urging us to seek outside ourselves but to seek within\n nachiketa seems to be asking yama about the transcendent but his question reveals how much he already knows\n beyond right and wrong the moment we enter duality relative existence we become subject to the situation that some youghts words and acts will impel us onward to higher consciousness and others will impel us to lower consciousness\n no matter where we may be at the moment it cannot be permanent\n by the nature of things we will keep moving up and down back and forth\n whenever we think we have attained some stability it is only a matter of the movement being so slow it is imperceptible to us\n we are always in danger of incurring suffering because of this\n in truth suffering is inevitable for even rising requires effort and unsureness or doubt as to the success of our endeavor\n as krishna says of us anxiety binds them with a hundred chains\n we suffer anxiety as to what is the right or wrong and anxiety as to whether we can avoid the wrong and manage to think and do the right\n even more we are busy getting and losing anxious to get the good and rid ourselves of the wrong\n and of course we are mostly deluded as to what is really right and wrong usually thinking that the pleasurable is right and the painful is wrong\n that is why krishna told arjuna both the good and the pleasant present themselves to men\n the wise having examined both distinguish the one from the other\n the wise prefer the good to the pleasant the foolish driven by fleshly desires prefer the pleasant to the good\n the danger is obvious\n nachiketa intuits that this terrible dragging back and forth this dilemma inherent in existence can come to an end not in the realm of relative existence but in its transcendence\n realizing the truth that trying to rise above any of the dualities is as foolish as trying to make dry water or cold fire is a tremendous breakthrough for the developing consciousness and indicates that the end of the search is near\n some of our monks visited a great saint in the himalayan foothills and spoke with him about spiritual life\n he told them your questions show that you are not far from the goal\n beyond cause and effect in ignorant religion sin and righteousness occupy a great deal of attention not necessarily because of a sincere desire to be virtuous but because of their effects\n desire and fear motivate the religionist at least mentally and emotionally for sin gets punished and righteousness gets rewarded\n punishment hurts and reward feels good\n punishment takes away and reward supplies\n the dispenser of reward and punishment is some kind or many kinds of deity who being an extension of the ignorant egos of the adherents of the religion judges good and bad on the basis of i like and i don t like i want and i don t want\n good sense and practicality have nothing to do with it\n the deity is either pleased or displeased and acts accordingly\n to complicate matters the deity can be placated if sinned against and being mollified by groveling and penitence will reward the sinner as much as if he had been virtuous maybe even more so the deity s love and mercy can be revealed\n we see this behavior in human beings all the time tears apology and self castigation not only stop the anger or displeasure they evoke a tenderness and openness that should sensibly only be evoked by right conduct\n so in evil religion for ignorance is evil despite the assurance that virtue is rewarded we see that sin and repentance are rewarded and the sinner assured of salvation\n such a religion becomes a living hell populated and promoted by living demons\n i expect that just about everyone reading these words are congratulating themselves on having gotten out of or avoided such religion\n ah the sane wisdom of the east\n really do we not see that good karma and bad karma are bugaboos just as much desired and feared as any heaven or hell proffered by western religion i knew a man that had a metaphysical bookstore\n shoplifting was a real problem\n now if he had put a sign on the door so the departing malefactors would have read something like thou shalt not steal or the soul that sinneth it shall die or know you that god will bring you into judgment it would have had no result perhaps even the opposite\n for after all were not his customers beyond all that judeo christian negativity indeed they were so he did this\n he put a sign on the door for all to see as they departed saying shoplifting is bad karma\n nearly every day that sign stopped at least one person\n most sheepishly shuffled back to the shelf and sneaked the book back\n some actually came to the owner and gave him the book along with an apology\n why had he evoked their higher moral sensibilities not a bit\n they had traded fear of sin and hell for fear of bad karma and retribution maybe even a bad rebirth\n the ego was still in the driver s seat and quite liable to stay there for a long time\n karma may be more scientific a concept than sin punishment and hell but the fear engendered is just as egoic and therefore just as negative and ultimately ignorant\n nachiketa had a clear vision of things\n the problem was not tears or smiles but the law of cause and effect the truth that for every action there is an equal responsive reaction\n reactivity inner and outer is also inherent in relative dual consciousness\n but nachiketa did not just want to get away from the noise and damp of the ocean of samsara he wanted to get away from the ocean itself\n a jail cell may be miserable or luxurious but it is still a prison\n nachiketa aspired to freedom\n he wished to attain that which was beyond cause and effect not just a means of avoiding them\n this is one of the reasons why religion is usually so pointless it attempts to make the fire stop burning rather than showing the way out of the conflagration\n it seeks to make bondage palatable pleasing to both the egocentric deity and the egocentric devotee\n a confederacy of dunces indeed\n beyond past present and future my first reading of the bhagavad gita revealed to me something i had intuited all my life the fundamental truth that space and time are utter illusions basic delusions of human consciousness\n what a relief so when in three or four days i heard one of the most intelligent of my university professors remark that time and space were the two fundamental realities you can imagine how much i appreciated the gita for clearing that nonsense up for me\n i appreciated myself too for being so clever as to understand it\n the time space continuum is a torment to the awakened consciousness for it is the basis for the existence of cause and effect and therefore of right and wrong\n it is impermanence itself the root cause of all suffering fear anxiety and instability\n since we have been immersed in relativity for creation cycles beyond number we find ourselves in a present whose vast roots are thoroughly unknown and whose effects will create an unknown future that will be a fusion of the past and the present present\n uncertainty and confusion are the results of even a small attempt to make sense of the whole thing\n and the idea of controlling any aspect is simply beyond our imagination\n we are drowning in a shoreless ocean\n but we do not just drown once and have it over with\n we drown daily every moment actually\n only the stupid or the willfully ignorant do not see this\n how can we blame those who take refuge in illusion whatever the form they do not need an analysis or judgment of their predicament they need a way out\n nachiketa is asking for that not for more philosophy or exposition of the problem\n transcendent being there is not a place beyond right and wrong beyond cause and effect beyond past present and future but a state of being that transcends them\n nachiketa sought to become an altogether different order of being to enter into the state of brahman itself\n knowing this to be so yama does not hesitate but literally spells it out\n he begins of that goal which all the vedas declare which is implicit in all penances and in pursuit of which men lead lives of continence and service of that will i briefly speak\n goal that which nachiketa seeks is not an abstraction but a positive reality known to yama\n perhaps the most heartening thing that can be said about that which is is the fact that it is the goal\n its attainment is not only possible it is inevitable\n the entire field of relative existence however much we have damaged or corrupted it and it in turn has damaged or corrupted us has a single purpose the attainment of brahman and the consequent liberation of the questing spirit atman \n this is what everything is all about\n so no wonder we have made such a mess of things literally\n not knowing either their or our purpose what else could be the result we are like the character in the woody allen movie that tried to play the cello by blowing through the holes\n ignorance is the root of all the trouble\n shake off this fever of ignorance\n stop hoping for worldly rewards\n fix your mind on the atman\n be free from the sense of ego counsels krishna\n you dream you are the doer you dream that action is done you dream that action bears fruit\n it is your ignorance it is the world s delusion that gives you these dreams\n seek this knowledge and comprehend clearly why you should seek it such it is said are the roots of true wisdom ignorance merely is all that denies them\n when men have thrown off their ignorance they are free from pride and delusion\n they have conquered the evil of worldly attachment\n they live in constant union with the atman\n all craving has left them\n they are no longer at the mercy of opposing sense reactions\n thus they reach that state which is beyond all change\n vedas by vedas yama means the teachings of illumined sages regarding the nature of brahman and the way to conscious union with brahman\n for veda means knowledge or wisdom\n alyough that word has come to be used only in the sense of the ancient sanskrit hymns found in the rig sama yajur and atharva vedas they are not meant here\n at the time of nachiketa the vedas were the orally transmitted wisdom of the vedic rishis that only later were written down as the upanishads\n in a broader sense the vedas are the words of any enlightened person about the nature of god and the realization of god\n books of speculative philosophy mean nothing to our search for divine consciousness\n only the teachings of those who have themselves reached the goal are relevant and woryour of our attention\n implicit in all penances the word rather poorly translated here as penances is tapasya\n literally it means the generation of heat or energy but is always used in a symbolic manner referring to spiritual practice and its effect especially the roasting of karmic seeds the burning up of karma\n tapasya means a practical i\n resultproducing spiritual discipline which culminates in spiritual evolution and enlightenment\n the important idea in yama s words are that our spiritual practice must be congruent with the nature of god\n though tapasya implies a discipline it cannot just be some type of militaristic coercion or mortification of the body and mind that are often nothing more than an expression of self loathing\n the religions of the world abound in admiration for those who torture the body and mind attaining abnormal psychic states foolishly mistaken for spiritual attainment\n but according to yama the goal must be implicit in all disciplines\n that is the disciplines themselves must embody the nature of god and our own selves as well\n a person unfamiliar with spiritual truth should be able through analysis of authentic practice to actually come to understand the truth regarding the nature of both the seeker and the goal\n if a spiritual practice cannot impart this knowledge by its very mechanics then it is invalid and cannot possibly lead to the goal\n for this is a very valuable fact only that practice which from the very first moment puts us in touch with god and begins to reveal our true nature is genuine yoga\n all else is illusion\n that is why krishna says what is man s will and how shall he use it let him put forth its power to uncover the atman not hide the atman man s will is the only friend of the atman his will is also the atman s enemy\n the plain truth is that putting the force of the will into erroneous practices will hide the truth from us even more whereas applying the will in correct practice will reveal divinity to us\n for divinity is inherent in true yoga\n in pursuit of which the upanishads teach us the truth of the unity of the atman and brahman\n therefore that truth is known as advaita not two meaning that there is no separation of the atman and brahman at any time\n simplistic thinkers especially in the west immediately begin to decry the idea of tapasya yoga or any other discipline insisting very shrilly that there is no need for such that to engage in spiritual practice is to affirm a delusion of separation between us and god\n they usually end up denying that either we or god even exist advocating a kind of petulant bullying nihilism reminding any sensible person of krishna s indictment these malignant creatures are full of egoism vanity lust wrath and consciousness of power\n they loathe me and deny my presence both in themselves and in others\n they are enemies of all men and of myself\n drastic words these but they address a drastic mental and spiritual aberration\n read the entire sixteenth chapter of the bhagavad gita for a full outline of such kinds of people\n this is but one of the reasons why a continual study of the gita is necessary for those who do not wish to go or be led astray in their spiritual pursuit\n no student of the gita could ever fall into such absurd pitfalls as these advaitans whose only unity is their absorption in the illusion of the ego\n the truth is that the realization of god not only can but must be pursued\n we do not pursue god understand for god is everywhere and always one with us\n rather we pursue the revelation of that eternal oneness and its manifestation on all levels of our present existence\n regarding this a yogi adept of the twentieth century dr\n taimni remarked in his book the science of yoga according to the yogic philosophy it is possible to rise completely above the illusions and miseries of life and to gain infinite knowledge bliss and power through enlightenment here and now while we are still living in the physical body\n and if we do not attain this enlightenment while we are still alive we will have to come back again and again into this world until we have accomplished this appointed task\n so it is not a question of choosing the path of yoga or rejecting it\n it is a question of choosing it now or in some future life\n it is a question of gaining enlightenment as soon as possible and avoiding the suffering in the future or postponing the effort and going through further suffering which is unnecessary and avoidable\n this is the meaning of yoga sutra the misery which is not yet come can and is to be avoided\n no vague promise of an uncertain postmortem happiness this but a definite scientific assertion of a fact verified by the experience of innumerable yogis saints and sages who have trodden the path of yoga throughout the ages\n it is absolutely sure seek and ye shall find\n brahmacharya brahmacharyam is the word swami prabhavananda translates as lives of continence and service\n radhakrishnan renders it the life of a religious student and swami sivananda life of a brahmaacharin\n in india the first stage of life is that of a student a brahmaachari\n the brahmaacharistudent leads a life of discipline the core of which is sexual continence a concept utterly lacking in other cultures as their present disintegration reveals\n he also serves his teacher in a practical way for the ideal environment of the brahmaacharya ashram is rural a forest setting being the ideal\n at the time the upanishads were first spoken all aryas lived in the forests living an agrarian life of the utmost simplicity\n the students of a teacher helped out in the day to day routine required by such a lifestyle\n but yama is not confining brahmaacharya to the student s stage of life and in modern times whatever the age or outer circumstances of the seeker it would consist of both self control abstinence and practical positive action including selfless service\n i once saw a cartoon in which a drunk was lying in a gutter and asking a salvation army woman can you save me here or do i have to go somewhere obviously being saved did not interest him very much\n but those who are truly interested say with the prodigal son i will arise and go\n living a life of purity and discipline is the way they rise and go\n it is most significant that yama says he will briefly speak of the goal\n why is this because the goal is brahman and brahman can only be spoken of very briefly\n this is because brahman is exceedingly simple in fact the only really simple incomplex thing there is\n also the intellect can only grasp the tiniest bit of the truth about brahman so not only can little be said little can be understood\n in a way this makes it very easy for us\n here is how the gita teaches us about brahman now i shall describe that which has to be known in order that its knower may gain immortality\n that brahman is beginningless transcendent eternal\n he is said to be equally beyond what is and what is not\n light of all lights he abides beyond our ignorant darkness knowledge the one thing real we may study or know the heart s dweller\n but nachiketa does not want to know about brahman he wants to know brahman\n with this in mind yama reveals both brahman and the way to brahman for they are the same by saying it is om\n you cannot be briefer than that\n nor do you need to be\n yama has said it all for om is the embodiment of the all\n he has as i say said it all but yama continues with a brief exposition of the nature of om\n om is supreme brahman this syllable is brahman\n this syllable is indeed supreme\n he who knows it obtains his desire\n it is not a symbol of brahman it is brahman\n om is not even a word it is the very presence of brahman\n om is not counted among words said sri ramakrishna\n it is not a word it is god himself said swami vivekananda\n this assertion is borne out by the fact that in sanskrit om is not treated as a word that is it does not go through any changes in form according to its grammatical position or status\n it has no plural possessive subjective objective or adjectival forms\n it is always just om and nothing else\n i could cite a great many authoritative statements affirming the divine nature of om but i recommend our publication the glories and powers of om which contains under many headings the scriptural statements on om\n obviously om is supreme being itself the supreme\n but yama has made this seemingly obvious comment to convey the fact that om is the supreme means to the realization of the supreme\n there is nothing higher than om nor is there any means of spiritual cultivation higher than om\n that is why patanjali simply said its repetition and meditation is the way\n yama then tells nachiketa that he who knows om obtains whatever he desires\n many upanishads state that om encompasses all existence and therefore literally is all things that all things are formed of om just as all clay pots are made of the single substance clay\n since all things are contained in om it can only follow that he who truly knows om by uniting his consciousness with it through its japa and meditation shall attain all that he desires as a matter of course\n such a wise one will of course desire only that which fulfills all desire brahman\n commenting on this very verse swami vivekananda said ay therefore first know the secret of this om that you are the om \n om is the ending of all desire by being the fulfillment of all desire\n the strongest and the highest it is the strongest support\n it is the highest symbol\n he who knows it is reverenced as a knower of brahman\n the need for security is fundamental to human existence\n this is especially true in relation to spiritual life\n even a little observation reveals how incredibly fragile spiritual consciousness and spiritual activity is in human life for everything militates against it and overwhelms it\n observing this jesus disciples asked him lord are there few that be saved and he assured them that indeed few manage to be saved\n the new testament greek word translated saved is sodzo which means to be safe in the sense of delivered from danger or harm\n it also means to be healed and become whole\n salvation in the view of jesus and his disciples was not having sins forgiven and allowed into heaven but was the same as the upanishadic sages liberation moksha \n all shall eventually attain liberation but only a few at a time do so\n not because it is so difficult but that so few even conceive of it and even fewer persevere in the pursuit of it\n jesus quoted the gita in his discourses and was certainly familiar with krishna s words to arjuna who cares to seek for that perfect freedom one man perhaps in many yousands\n then tell me how many of those who seek freedom shall know the total truth of my being perhaps one only\n with this perspective yama tells nachiketa that om is the strongest and highest support\n swami pabhavananda translated alambana the second time as symbol no doubt thinking of om as an object of meditation\n alyough its supporting power is most important in relation to spiritual life and practice yama makes no such explicit qualification so we can be sure that om is the empowerment and support of everything positive in our life\n this too is asserted many times in the upanishads\n knower of om knower of brahman\n he who knows it is reverenced as a knower of brahman\n some translators render this he who knows it is revered in the world of brahman\n for a knower of om is translated into that world having been transmuted into brahman through om\n it is no wonder then that the mundaka upanishad says about om dismiss other utterances\n this is the bridge to immortality\n om is our self atman how can om have such an incredible effect upon us because we are om\n it is our own self atman \n the self whose symbol is om is the omniscient lord\n he is not born\n he does not die\n he is neither cause nor effect\n this ancient one is unborn imperishable eternal yough the body be destroyed he is not killed\n if brahman was not at the core of our being as the core of our being we could not possibly become one with brahman\n all talk of becoming is of course not really accurate if we think of it as becoming something we are not\n rather it is the becoming aware of becoming established in our eternal unity with brahman\n some years ago workers in a burmese temple were moving a huge plaster image of buddha with heavy equipment\n something went wrong and the image was dropped\n to their astonishment the plaster which was only a layer a few inches thick broke and fell off revealing that the image was solid gold centuries before it had been covered with plaster to protect it from thieves\n today it is considered the single most valuable image of buddha in the world\n we are like that\n a layer of relative existence has been plastered onto our consciousness for so long that we think we are the plaster\n when the plaster was broken the image was revealed to be gold and when our plaster is broken we shall be revealed as parts of brahman waves of the one ocean of being\n we shall then know that we are not born we do not die we are neither cause nor effect we are unborn imperishable eternal unaffected by any conditions of the body whatsoever\n for as shankara sang i am not the mind intellect yought or ego not hearing not tasting not smelling not seeing i am not the elements ether earth fire air i am the form of conscious bliss i am spirit i am neither prana nor the five vital airs nor the seven components of the gross body nor the subtle bodies nor organs of action i am the form of conscious bliss i am spirit i have no aversion clinging greed delusion no envy or pride and no duty or purpose i have no desire and i have no freedom i am the form of conscious bliss i am spirit i have no merit or sin nor pleasure or pain no mantra pilgrimage veda or sacrifice not enjoying enjoyable or enjoyer i am the form of conscious bliss i am spirit i have no death or fear no distinction of caste neither father nor mother nor do i have birth no friend or relation guru or disciple i am the form of conscious bliss i am spirit i am wiyout attributes i am wiyout form i am all pervading i am omnipresent by senses untouched neither free nor knowable i am the form of conscious bliss i am spirit we do not really need to become immortal and eternal for we are that already\n instead we need to get beyond the illusory consciousness of birth and death cause and effect and the entire range of relative existence\n the japa and meditation of om is the way\n the immortal self yama has just told nachiketa that yough the body be destroyed he the self is not killed\n then he continues if the slayer think that he slays if the slain think that he is slain neither of them knows the truth\n the self slays not nor is he slain\n before considering this upanishadic passage here is what the bhagavad gita the great digest of the upanishads has to say about this bodies are said to die but that which possesses the body is eternal\n it cannot be limited or destroyed\n some say this atman is slain and others call it the slayer they know nothing\n how can it slay or who shall slay it know this atman unborn undying never ceasing never beginning deathless birthless unchanging for ever\n how can it die the death of the body knowing it birthless knowing it deathless knowing it endless for ever unchanging dream not you do the deed of the killer \n dreaming that is the key\n god is dreaming the entire drama of the cosmos but he knows it and controls the dream\n we too are dreaming the drama of our life so krishna tells us you dream you are the doer you dream that action is done you dream that action bears fruit\n it is your ignorance it is the world s delusion that gives you these dreams\n the richest people in the world if they dream they are penniless suffer the frustration and fear of poverty just as keenly as do those who really are paupers\n when they awake the mental pain disperses but it was no less real\n this is something we often miss when we subscribe to the theory of maya\n the experiences such as birth death and disease may be illusion but the suffering they produce is not\n the grief we feel at the death of a loved one is real even if the death is not\n that is why the sankhya karika the basic text of the sankhya philosophy upon which the yoga philosophy is based opens with a discussion of suffering as our problem\n certainly illusion should be dispelled but that will not take care of the deeper problem our capacity for suffering\n it is foolish and callous to bully those who suffer by expounding on the unreality of that to which they are reacting\n for there is no thing or situation which can make us suffer\n suffering is our reaction to those things\n when we reach the state where we no longer react for pleasure is as destructive as pain then we will be free\n patanjali s dictum that yoga is the cessation of modifications of the chitta does not refer at all to restless youghts in the superficial mind\n he is speaking of the capacity for any kind of reactivity to outer stimuli\n it is when we are unreacting and resting in our true self that we are in the state of yoga\n to merely fiddle around with the shallow thinking mind believing that calming it makes us yogis is deluding ourselves\n our problem is far far greater and deeper than jittery youghts\n it is the capacity for suffering and for being deluded\n to be awake in the fullest sense is to be incapable of sleep and dream\n i am speaking metaphysically\n all the philosophy and analysis in the world will not help us\n we need to awaken forever\n that is what real yoga is all about\n slayer and slain are roles in the dream drama of the evolving consciousness\n if we know not just suppose or believe this then nothing can move us from the state of peace that is a quality of our true self\n fortunately for us all the cliche about there is naught but thinking makes it so is bunkum another western truth that mercifully is false\n the body can be slain and can be a slayer\n being part of the dream it really acts and is acted upon in the dream context\n the dreamer however is not part of the dream even when it projects an image of itself into the dream and slays or is slain\n nothing external can affect or change the internal reality\n again awakening is the only solution and we should accept nothing less\n any view other than this which yama presents to nachiketa is but the blind leading the blind\n a great flaw in the thinking of most of us is only accepting half of this great truth\n we easily affirm our immortality saying i can never die and thus reject the idea that we can be slain\n yet we accept the concept that we can be slayers and make a great to do about sin and karma\n is not that so because we want to control the behavior of others by promising rewards and threatening punishments we have literally bought into this delusion and traded on it for life after life fooling even ourselves\n though we find the truth in the upanishads or the gita we still keep on worrying about purifying ourselves and clearing out our karma\n half deluded we stumble on distracting ourselves from the real goal sinking deeper into the morass\n consider the lives of saints\n so many of them have been great sinners even murderers or incredibly ignorant and yet we see them either instantly entering into the state of holiness or rocketing to it in a short time\n the reason is simple they had never committed a sin in their eternal lives\n like david they awoke and found themselves with god\n the indwelling self smaller than the smallest greater than the greatest this self forever dwells within the hearts of all\n when a man is free from desire his mind and senses purified he beholds the glory of the self and is wiyout sorrow\n so yama now tells nachiketa\n smaller than the smallest greater than the greatest we tend to think of infinity as boundlessly large when in actuality that which is infinite transcends space and can therefore not be measured in any manner\n it cannot be small or large\n which is why there is no thing too small or to great for god to be involved with\n the self being a part of god is likewise beyond measurement\n it is neither small nor large gross nor subtle\n in fact the self is simply beyond description\n we can only talk around it not really express its mystery\n this self forever dwells within the hearts of all however there are some things that can be said about the presence of the self therefore yama does tell nachiketa that this self forever dwells within the hearts of all\n the self is eternal\n it has no beginning and it can never have an end\n whatever it is it has been forever\n what it is not it shall never be\n we say this glibly but usually do not believe and rarely manifest it\n nevertheless it is bedrock truth\n the self being beyond time and space cannot possibly be anywhere\n yet we readily say that it is within\n this is as close to the truth about the self as we can get\n at the core of all things having itself neither periphery or core is the unchanging self\n it dwells in the sense that it abides yet the self does not at all exist in the way we understand existence which is completely relative\n the self is absolute and relativity can never affect or touch it\n the self abides in the hearts of all\n but what is the heart guha means both cave and heart but it also means to be in a secret place\n within the inmost heart of all things is that which transcends even inmost\n that is the self\n and there is no thing whatsoever that does not have the self as its eternal unchanging indweller\n the self can be within all as their essential being only if the self is all\n this is the great revelation\n all that we see around us is resting upon the self as the substratum\n all that we see objectively is maya illusion\n that which we cannot see but which we can be is the self the all pervading subject\n this all sounds wonderful but what possible meaning can it have if we do not experience this glorious truth for ourselves nothing obviously\n so yama proceeds to tell nachiketa how the self can be realized\n when a man is free from desire to be truly free from desire is to be incapable of desire\n to not be desiring anything at the moment is not what is spoken of here\n we mistakenly think that if we can become indifferent to all things and want nothing we will be free from desire\n but we will still be in the condition where desire is possible even if it be in the future or even a future life\n to desire something we have to feel inadequate but even more fundamentally we have to have objective consciousness and a belief in the reality of the objects perceived and a belief that in some way we can enter into relation with those objects that we can affect them and they can affect us\n what a heap of delusions desire is only a symptom of profound ignorance and delusion\n in itself it is no more the problem than red blotches on the skin are the disease we call measles\n see we even name a disease as the symptoms\n however true desirelessness and that is what yama is speaking about is the state of the liberated those who know the self\n his mind and senses purified a few years ago a valuable book was published by the sri ramakrishna math in madras a translation of the sankhya karika by swami virupakshananda\n in the publisher s note we find this vedanta takes off to ethereal heights only from the granite platform provided by sankhya\n not only vedanta but also modern science cannot be understood in all their nuances wiyout a firm grasp of the sankhyan tenets\n and the translator writes of all the philosophical systems the sankhya philosophy is considered to be the most ancient school of yought\n sankhya philosophy maintains a prominent place in all the shastras \n in the mahabharata it is said that there is no knowledge such as sankhya and no power like that of yoga\n on which sankhya is based\n we should have no doubt as to sankhya being the highest knowledge\n later he outlines how the sankhya philosophy is presented in the chandogya katha and svetasvatara upanishads particularly\n and in the mahabharata and puranas we find the sankhya philosophy fully explained\n the second chapter of the bhagavad gita part of the mahabharata is entitled sankhya yoga and krishna mentions sankhya by name as the truth he is expounding\n i mention this because it is so common for students to approach the upanishads as exponents of the simplistic monism that is erroneously yought to be advaita\n with this distorted frame of reference the upanishadic teachings that are very obviously opposed to their opinion are ignored\n but we cannot afford the luxury of wilful ignorance\n simply babbling that it is all one and we are already there accomplishes absolutely nothing\n and besides it is not true in the simplistic sense they mean\n god the primal purusha is eternally associated with prakriti pradhana on the macrocosmic level and continually projects and withdraws it as the ever evolving creation\n in the same way each individual purusha is eternally associated with prakriti on the microcosmic level and engages in a series of incarnations evolving the personal prakriti to the point where it becomes a perfect mirror of the individual purusha and there is a practical separation between the two just as on the cosmic level\n let us not forget patanjali defines yoga liberation as a condition of the chitta of our personal prakriti not a simple intellectual insight or realization\n the essence is this each one of us is evolving our own prakriti just as god is evolving the universe\n the difference is that god is not caught in the drama and we are\n sankhya states that we must learn to separate our consciousness from its enmeshment in prakriti but that is only the preparation\n then we must engage in the process of bringing our prakriti to a state of perfection in which it no longer produces waves but becomes a permanently quiescent reflection of purusha of our true self which buddhism calls our original face\n that process is yoga and yama has this in mind when he speaks of the seeker having his mind and senses purified\n merely reading a few books and hearing a few lectures on the nature of the self will not do it\n we must focus our attention on in the energy fields we call mind and senses and completely repolarize and reconstruct them\n be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind wrote saint paul\n patanjali speaks of the process of kriya yoga the yoga of purification consisting of austerity tapasya self study and devoting the life to god\n yama saint paul patanjali and krishna all tell us the same thing become a yogi\n he beholds the glory of the self the self cannot be intellectually conceived or spoken about but it can be seen and thereby fully known by the purified consciousness\n and it is seen within the core of our being within the cave of the heart\n caves are important symbols\n though they are to be found everywhere we naturally think of yogis as dwelling in caves\n which they do metaphorically\n in the gospels we see that christ consciousness is born in a cave and resurrects in a cave\n it all takes place in the heart\n wherefore the wise solomon said keep your heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life\n the practice of yoga mediation is the keeping of the heart which transforms the yogi s life\n it is said that shiva sits immersed in samadhi but occasionally awakens arises and dances in ecstasy exclaiming over and over o who i am who i am the same wonder at the glory of the self will be experienced by the persevering yogi\n and is wiyout sorrow how could there be sorrow or any slightest form of suffering or discontent for those who behold that glory and realize that they are themselves that glory it can be said of such a one as arjuna said of krishna you know yourself through yourself alone\n and as krishna said of the perfected yogi to obey the atman is his peaceful joy sorrow melts into that clear peace his quiet mind is soon established in peace\n now that he holds it the knowledge of the self he knows this treasure above all others faith so certain shall never be shaken by heaviest sorrow\n who knows the atman knows that happiness born of pure knowledge the joy of sattwa\n deep his delight after strict self schooling sour toil at first but at last what sweetness the end of sorrow\n the omnipresent self though seated he travels far yough at rest he moves all things\n who but the purest of the pure can realize this effulgent being who is joy and who is beyond joy\n yama continues instructing nachiketa on the nature of the self\n being a highly developed being nachiketa had doubtless intuited most of this already but for us who were raised in the dry gulch of the west and its religions his words are profoundly stirring astounding actually\n who could believe that in this chaotic world there were ever and still are sages who by direct experience have seen and spoken these truths we should analyze them carefully not for mere philosophical exactitude but for a good joyful revel in knowing the facts at last\n unmoving he moves being rooted in infinity and thereby beyond space the self can never go anywhere\n when we speak of the atma descending into relative existence or coming into matter we are only describing the mayic experience that is itself nothing more than a training movie\n if we see a motion picture about europe we do not think we have actually been there yet we did see europe\n in the same way under the spell of maya we have all kinds of experiences yet they are mere appearance only\n appearance however is real even if insubstantial\n so we both are and are not here\n i experience writing this and you experience reading it\n but the environment in which we live including our bodies is but the picture projected onto the formless screen of consciousness that is our self\n so going nowhere the self goes everywhere\n being no thing the self becomes all things\n doing nothing the self does everything\n this is the way of it\n unmoved he is the mover nothing affects the self but the self affects all situations and things\n sankhya philosophy postulates that alyough prakriti never touches the purusha it is the proximity of the purusha that causes prakriti to move and manifest in manifold ways\n in the west we find the expressions uncaused cause and unmoved mover\n these apply to the individual self as much as to god\n there is a very practical application of this fact\n being under the spell of maya we think all this is happening to me\n all this is being done to me\n but that is erroneous\n we are making it all happen we are doing it to ourselves\n there are no victims\n everything proceeds from us\n consequently we can study our lives and determine what is going on in our inner mind which is not the self either \n our lives and environment are mirror images revealing our states of mind\n our life is an exercise in consciousness\n there are computer games in which the images on the screen are actually manipulated by the player s mind and will\n that is but a feeble glimpse of the truth about our entire chain of births and deaths\n that is also what karma is\n you dream you are the doer you dream that action is done you dream that action bears fruit\n it is your ignorance it is the world s delusion that gives you these dreams\n who can know him we have a terrible conditioning\n we believe that all knowledge must come from outside ourselves that we are blanks that need to be written on\n in contemporary america this is very marked\n everybody thinks they need to have classes or lessons on everything\n some years back a friend of our ashram pointed this out about horse riding\n she commented that everyone she knew took horse riding lessons in contrast to her children who just got up on a horse and rode\n the she commented everyone thinks they have to be taught to do anything rather than learning on their own by experience\n this spills over into our philosophical life too\n we think we are dummies that have to have every nuance every subtle point taught to us and even worse that they all have to be embodied in technical terms\n it is only sensible to inquire about these things from those with more experience and knowledge than ourselves but childish dependence is no wisdom at all\n spock began one of his books my telling new mothers that they knew much more about caring for babies than they yought they did and to trust their inner feelings on the matter\n this caused quite a stir\n i was only a child at the time and yet the ripples of consternation even reached me through a magazine review of his revolutionary book\n we have no confidence and spiritual laziness often compounds the problem\n for some reason swami prabhavanandaji gives us this translation who but the purest of the pure can realize this effulgent being\n that is so lofty so noble that frankly it paralyzes our aspiration completely\n i am not the purest of the pure so how can i know the self i will have to ask others to give me hints about it\n but that is very mistaken\n the actual upanishadic question is who else but myself can know that radiant one devam the self this is not just an inspiring yought it is perfect good sense\n being the self who else but i can know my self others may see the divine in me but i alone can know the divine in me\n in the chandogya upanishad we have the thrilling story of uddalaka instructing svetaketu on the nature of the self saying to him over and over thou art that\n but however stirring that account may be uddalaka is only telling him about the self\n it is up to svetaketu to know the self\n someone can bring us strawberries show them to us and even put them in our mouths but we alone can know their taste no one can taste them for us\n in the same way millions may tell us about our self but we alone can really know it\n it begins and ends with us\n self knowledge is the most natural thing for us all\n we are working very hard to produce and maintain the unnatural state of not knowing the self\n once we get sensible and literally wise up things will change\n joy and beyond the self is this effulgent being who is joy and who is beyond joy\n we are ourselves devas gods\n there is no happiness or joy anywhere but in ourselves for we are not happy or joyful by nature we are happiness and joy\n the idea is that joy is the permanent eternal condition of our true self\n the word translated joy in this verse is mada which means delight intoxication and exhilaration\n to delight in our self is the ultimate enjoyment\n in the last essay i mentioned that it is said that shiva sits immersed in samadhi but occasionally awakens arises and dances in ecstasy exclaiming over and over o who i am who i am this is delight in the self\n yet yama says that the self rejoices and rejoices not\n he is trying to convey that the delight in the self is not delight in an object but is totally subjective and inward turned\n this is very important for as the yogi develops through his sadhana his prakriti nature begins to reflect his inner joy more and more and he can start delighting in the delight reflection rather than in the real thing and come to the conclusion that he has already attained the state yama is speaking about\n this is the state of shuddhasattwa of extreme purity of the chitta the mind substance of the yogi\n if he is not careful he will mistake the mirror image for his true face and believe he has attained what still lies before him\n innumerable are the yogis who have been deluded in this way and become trapped in the subtlest reaches of maya\n that is why lord krishna said how hard to break through is this my maya made of the gunas for to delight in the mere picture of the joy that is the self is to still be trapped in objective outward turned consciousness\n as krishna further tells us only that yogi whose joy is inward inward his peace and his vision inward shall come to brahman and know nirvana\n how do we avoid mistaking the image for the reality by continuing to practice meditation and other spiritual disciplines until the moment the body drops off a sure sign of a deluded individual is the belief that he has gone beyond the need for meditation and other spiritual practices\n baba no longer needs to meditate\n baba has transcended these things long ago\n baba is always in that so such things are unnecessary for him\n you can put ma in place of baba if need be\n but what about sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi yes\n what about it a very famous indian guru of the twentieth century believed that he had attained sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi so he announced that he no longer needed to meditate since there was nothing more it could do for him\n while his disciples meditated he stayed in his room and fiddled around with this and that\n after some years he was visited by two americans who yought of themselves as big guns on the american spiritual scene\n not wanting to scandalize them by messing about while everyone else in the ashram meditated sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi baba started attending the meditation sessions and meditating also\n after a few days he remarked in wonder to a group of disciples that he could perceive a very marked improvement in his mind and consciousness since starting to meditate daily and expressed wonder and puzzlement over how that could be\n unfortunately no one had either the good sense or the courage to tell him so when the american biggies left snsb went back to fooling around in his room during the meditation periods\n consider the perfect life of gautama buddha\n to the last moment of his life he lived like a normal monk\n he was eighty years of age yet he went forth and begged for his food every day no one brought specially prepared goodies for him\n he lived outdoors under a tree not in a special retreat designed by a renowned architect disciple\n he dressed in the simple minimal clothing of a monk not in some expensive rigs donated by disciples to express their devotion\n he walked everywhere he went\n he did not ride in some cart or chariot provided by a rich patron out of consideration for his age\n and here is the most important point of all he meditated for hours a day even withdrawing for weeks and months at a time to engage in even more intense meditation\n he never relaxed his disciplines for an hour much less a day\n in this way he showed us how to not fall into delusion keep on till the end until the self is truly known\n and then keep on until death says the end\n the sorrowless self formless is he yough inhabiting form\n in the midst of the fleeting he abides forever\n all pervading and supreme is the self\n the wise man knowing him in his true nature transcends all grief\n yama continues to instruct us regarding the nature of the self using the most simple words yet with the most profound meanings\n formless is he yough inhabiting form ashariram sharireshu the bodiless within bodies such is the self\n though ever wiyout a body or adjunct in any form as far as its true nature is concerned yet all bodies are inhabited by the self\n there is no form in which the self the formless does not dwell\n who can number the forms in which we have manifested from the beginning of our evolutionary peregrinations in relativity yet we have slipped away from each embodiment as bodiless as we were from the first\n being one with brahman it can be said of the self as well as of brahman everywhere are his hands eyes feet his heads and his faces this whole world is his ear he exists encompassing all things doing the tasks of each sense yet himself devoid of the senses standing apart he sustains he is free from the gunas but feels them\n he is within and wiyout he lives in the live and the lifeless subtle beyond mind s grasp so near us so utterly distant undivided he seems to divide into objects and creatures sending creation forth from himself he upholds and withdraws it light of all lights he abides beyond our ignorant darkness knowledge the one thing real we may study or know the heart s dweller\n in the midst of the fleeting he abides forever anavastheshv avasthitam the stable among the unstable the unchanging among the ever changing so is the self\n for aeons we are entertained with the ever shifting kaleidoscope of maya s web\n finally we are no longer entertained by it but wearied\n yet we find ourselves addicted to it\n only in the beginning do addicts love their addiction\n in time they come to loathe it yet refuse to even hear of ridding themselves of it\n and then at last they see themselves as slaves hating their bondage but incapable of shedding it\n yet we are ever free\n people bound by various addictions including alcohol and drugs would come to sri ramakrishna and plead for help\n often he would just touch them and their enslavement would be gone forever\n learning of this we naturally glorify sri ramakrishna for his power of merciful deliverance but we must not overlook the great truth it demonstrates it was the nature of those people to be free\n otherwise he could not have freed them\n if we would seek freedom then we must seek it only in the self\n and the self being within we must seek within\n for wiyout meditation where is peace wiyout peace where is happiness all pervading time and space being mirages the self is everywhere\n infinity is not bigness so big it cannot be calculated it is beyond measuring because it transcends the modes of measurable being\n it is simply another mode of existence altogether\n the truth is the atman like the paramatman is omnipresent omniscient and omnipotent\n this latter is easy since the self never does anything\n so there is no place where the self is not present\n it goes everywhere wiyout moving\n supreme the self is supreme but not in the sense of earthly entities\n it is all embracing\n not only is there nothing above it there is nothing beneath it for such states are not native and therefore impossible to it\n but maya is doing a superb job at convincing us otherwise and fooling us into thinking that the purpose of both material life and sadhana is to expand in the illusory realms of conditioned existence to become large or small to enter in or depart none of which are even possible for the self\n simply hearing about the self can make us more ignorant than we were before if we interpret the self in terms of samsaric delusion\n the wise the wise are those who know the self as it is\n and that they have accomplished by shedding their association with the unreal and turning back to their own reality\n transcend all grief they transcend all grief by removing their center of awareness from the realm in which suffering is possible\n suffering being an illusion they need only awaken from the dream and abide in the real\n this is not a negative state for it is not just a removal of sorrow but the entering into the bliss that is the nature of the self\n who can know the self the sense of nonsense i once read a long and rather tedious essay on shakespeare s policy of putting discomfiting truths into the mouths of fools so people could scorn them and not get upset with him for unmasking their folly\n it often happens that what people hope is just fun or nonsense is really insightful commentary on their foibles\n the happens very often in poetry for everybody knows we need not take poetry seriously\n edward lear who protected himself by first claiming that he wrote nonsense verse made some profound observations on life\n some of his limericks have a lot to say about how life should be lived\n one of his wisest works was a poem entitled the jumblies in which he tells us at the end of every verse far and few far and few are the lands where the jumblies live their heads are green and their hands are blue and they went to sea in a sieve\n these exotic people went to sea in a sieve\n everyone else said they would drown considering that a sieve is more holes than anything else\n some even told them that yough they might manage it would be a wrong thing to do\n but they did it anyway excellently and to great profit\n upon their return all the nay sayers announced that they too would go to sea in a sieve\n but lear assures us still that far and few far and few are the lands where the jumblies live\n no everyone will not be going to sea in a sieve\n just the far and few jumblies\n the requirements perhaps lear as he wrote the poem yought of the following from the gospel of saint luke then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able\n this is not a statement of pessimism but of simple fact\n all manage in time but in dribbles\n yama has been very encouraging in his exposition of the self but now having told of its wonder he enters upon the subject of what is required to know the self\n actually the price he presents to us is quite simple and direct\n if we are interested then the price is substantial but not impossible\n if we are only window shoppers then the price seems unreasonable and beyond payment\n here it is in two verses the self is not known through study of the scriptures nor through subtlety of the intellect nor through much learning but by him who longs for him is he known\n verily unto him does the self reveal his true being\n by learning a man cannot know him if he desist not from evil if he control not his senses if he quiet not his mind and practice not meditation\n not through study of the scriptures i was fortunate some years back to live near an ideal brahmin scholar a professor of mathematics at a university\n together we formed a hindu parishad to help indian residents stay focused on sanatana dharma while living in the west\n at our first meeting several of us spoke\n in his discourse sri dwivedi spoke of the nature of true dharma as a way of life and not a system of abstract concepts\n in contrast the other religions of the world are all people of the book\n their entire identity is taken up with following a book and professing its teachings\n as a consequence he pointed out they can all dialogue with even the marxists for they too are people of a book\n but what can they say to real dharma which cannot be gotten out of a book see how vast are the sacred writings of sanatana dharma yet we know that they are of limited value once true wisdom is gained\n reading the bhagavad gita opened to me a world i had never yought could exist\n how many wonderful things i found therein many were amazing not the least being the statement when the whole country is flooded the reservoir becomes superfluous\n so to the illumined seer the vedas are all superfluous\n here was a scripture that told me i should go beyond it and know for myself and showed me the way to do that sri ramakrishna often used the simile of a letter\n once you read it and know what it says what more need do you have for it the self cannot be known through scriptural study for krishna tells us that he who even wishes to know of yoga transcends the vedic rites\n books are nothing more than paper and ink\n obsession with them is detrimental proving the truth of the statement that the letter kills but the spirit gives life\n we must get behind the words of even illumined masters and tap the source of those words\n sri ramakrishna frequently pointed out that almanacs predict rainfall but you cannot get a drop by squeezing them however hard\n in the same way intense study of scriptures cannot give a drop of spiritual life for no book can reveal that which lies beyond all we think or know\n not through subtlety of the intellect we cannot possibly figure out the nature of anything much less the self by mere intellection\n this is not the fault of the mind any more than it is the fault of a blender that you cannot get television programs through it\n there is absolutely no faculty which can perceive or reveal the self\n the self alone knows itself\n as long as we attempt to perceive the self through any intermediary just so long shall we be frustrated or worse deluded\n there is no instrument however subtle no capacity of the mind however refined that can reveal the self\n yet the purified intellect buddhi can intuit the presence of the self and even some of its traits and this is good but this is not self knowledge\n many intelligent people with highly developed intellects mistake this intuition for direct experience and knowledge\n this is a subtle trap we must avoid diligently\n how could we know if we have fallen into the trap rather than risen into the light that actually is easy to determine\n if we can talk about what we perceive and define it then it is not the self but only our approximation\n that which lies within the range of speech lies outside the self\n no matter how near we can come to the self it is not the same as knowing the self\n for when the self is revealed all knowing not only ceases it becomes impossible\n intelligence should not be confused with intellectuality\n intelligence is a help to the revelation of the self but intellectuality is an insurmountable hindrance\n that is why jesus said to god thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes\n to demonstrate this vividly jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven\n think how direct and uncomplicated a child s mind usually is\n also they are capable of intensely magical mystical yought\n how unquestioning they accept the idea of the miraculous including the power of the individual including themselves to work marvels\n how sad that they ever come to know better in a wrong way\n a friend of mine was watching a television program in which a pianist seemed to be floating in the air and even turning over and over\n how do you suppose they do that she mused to herself aloud\n instantly her five year old said easy there s a magician hidden in the piano\n and that is so true there is a magical being hidden in each one of us known as the self which can do and does all things\n not through much learning vyasa was the greatest sage of post vedic india codifier of the vedas commentator on the yoga sutras author of the mahabharata which includes the bhagavad gita and the brahma sutras vedanta sutras \n vast as his writings were hummed up everything that was taught by these holy books saying i shall tell you in half a verse sloka what has been written in tens of millions of books brahman is real\n the world is unreal\n the jiva individual spirit is none other than brahman\n so when the future swami turiyananda told sri ramakrishna that he studied vedanta for several hours a day the great master was astonished\n quoting the words of vyasa he asked how can you spend hours studying something so simple what more is there to say turiyananda got the idea behind the idea and himself became a knower of the self\n all the learning in the world is futile in relation to the self and brahman for they lie outside the scope of the intellect\n the ear cannot hear color the eye cannot smell fragrance\n no thing can know the self but the self\n it can be done yama s words of seeming negation are really quite positive for he then tells nachiketa but by him who longs for him is he known\n verily unto him does the self reveal his true being\n this is a remarkable statement\n there are no tools or gimmicks that can mechanically lead us to the vision of the self\n certainly there are methods that aid in our search that is what yoga is all about\n but it is a mistake to think that a technique can be applied like a crowbar to break open the inner treasury and loot the vault\n and this is the attitude of most seekers\n methods such as yoga meditation worship and good deeds are necessary to successfully prosecute our quest for god\n their function is twofold they prepare us make us capable for the attainment of self knowledge and they are manifestations evidence actually of the genuineness of our aspiration\n by engaging in them we live out our intention\n ma anandamayi continually assured people that the desire for the god was the way to god everything else were aids or expressions but it is our own divine self will that accomplishes our liberation\n this is very important to understand\n it is commonly said that all religions are valid that they all led to the same goal\n that is true to some degree but it leaves out the real fact it is the seeking that brings about the finding\n frankly it is the seekers who validate the religions not the other way around\n people finding god in all religions is not a statement about the worth of those religions but a statement about the worth of those people\n sri ramakrishna attained god vision through the various religions he practiced and thereby demonstrated their viability as spiritual paths\n but he also revealed that it is the nature of the individual to attain that vision whatever the path that is followed\n for wiyout that innate capacity what value would the religions have the jivatman by its nature can know the paramatman\n as the psalmist said deep calleth unto deep\n like attracts like it really does take one to know one\n swami prabhavananda notes that an alternate translation can be whom the self chooses by him is he attained\n in india they have the saying he who chooses god has first been chosen by him\n jesus told his disciples ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you\n the very fact that we are seeking god is guarantee of our finding for it is an indication that he has called us\n and he does not call in vain\n nor do we seek in vain\n verily unto him does the self reveal his true being\n yet there are obstacles to knowing the self by learning a man cannot know him if he desist not from evil if he control not his senses if he quiet not his mind and practice not meditation\n learning yama lists mere intellectual study the heaping up of extraneous knowledge which by its character is external and superficial as an obstacle not so much in itself but by the illusion of knowledge that arises in the self sait isfied mind of the knower\n yama s assertion shows how mistaken it is to translate swadhyaya self study as study of scriptures when we encounter it in the yoga sutras\n the kena upanishad examines this matter saying he by whom brahman is not known knows it he by whom it is known knows it not\n it is not known by those who know it it is known by those who do not know it\n obviously the word know has two meanings here\n one is the mere intellection about brahman the other is knowledge derived from the direct experience of brahman from conscious union with brahman\n there is a knowing that is unknowing and an unknowing that is knowing\n that is why swami prabhavananda renders the kena verse he truly knows brahman who knows him as beyond knowledge he who thinks that he knows knows not\n the ignorant think that brahman is known but the wise know him to be beyond knowledge\n persisting in evil evil in all forms must be abandoned if the self which is all good is to be known\n this should not be hard to understand but many deny it anyway or try to skirt around it\n of them jesus said they have their reward a false security that is really the sleep of death\n but for us who wish to live it is important to determine what is good and what is evil what is right and what is wrong\n sanatana dharma has a concept of right and wrong unique among the world religions\n the others teach that something is right or wrong because their god or prophet has said so in their infallible scriptures\n it is in the bible it is in the zendavesta it is in the koran etc\n alyough the scriptures of hindu dharma do mention things as being good or evil the basis for the statements are utterly different from that of other religions\n sanatana dharma does not look upon a thing as wrong because god or gods have declared it wrong or some lawgiver has prohibited it\n and the same in relation to the things that are right\n rather a thing is good or evil according to its innate character\n many times people tried to get mata anandamayi to approve or disapprove of something\n but she would simply say if it takes you toward the goal it is good\n if it takes you away from the goal it is evil\n that which darkens obscures or limits our consciousness is bad\n that which lights clears and expands our consciousness is good\n that which helps in the search for god is good that which hinders or delays it is not\n we all know people who declare that their addictions and illusions either do not hurt them or even are good for them\n very well they have their reward\n but the intelligent do not engage in such childish rationalization\n they impartially examine and conclude accordingly\n it is all a matter of the individual s interest and honesty\n in other words it is all in our hands as are all the aspects of our life if we face up to it\n sanatana dharma does not list bads and goods because it assumes that those who wish to pursue dharma can judge for themselves\n though we can certainly determine whether the vedic scriptures consider something harmful or helpful we should look upon the list as neither exhaustive or even binding\n sanatana dharma is manava dharma human dharma\n and human beings use their intelligent reason\n sanatana dharma also leaves every one free to be wise or foolish\n dharma never condemns or praises\n it just waits to be fulfilled\n lack of sense control the senses must be controlled but we usually mistake the way to do so\n the upanishads use the simile of horses pulling a chariot and we mistake that too thinking it a symbol of incredible forces to be overcome\n but we need not think of it so drastically\n before you control a horse you tame it\n so before we control the senses we tame them through purification\n sadhana is the only way\n meditation alone purifies in a lasting manner\n at the same time we purify the senses by directing them godward\n we make the eyes look at sacred symbols or depictions the ears to hear the words of sacred texts and sacred music the nose to smell the offered incense the tongue to taste the offered sweets or food and the inner sense of touch to feel the exalted atmosphere created by worship and contact with the holy\n pilgrimage is valuable because it is a total sense experience of holiness\n the good news is that we need not struggle with the senses but turn them in spiritual directions\n restlessness of mind restlessness of mind is itself great suffering\n yama says that a quiet mind is indispensable to selfknowledge\n here is what krishna has to say about it if a yogi has perfect control over his mind and struggles continually in this way to unite himself with brahman he will come at last to the crowning peace of nirvana the peace that is in me\n when can a man be said to have achieved union with brahman when his mind is under perfect control and freed from all desires so that he becomes absorbed in the atman and nothing else\n the light of a lamp does not flicker in a windless place that is the simile which describes a yogi of onepointed mind who meditates upon the atman\n when through the practice of yoga the mind ceases its restless movements and becomes still he realizes the atman\n it sait isfies him entirely\n then he knows that infinite happiness which can be realized by the purified heart but is beyond the grasp of the senses\n he stands firm in this realization\n because of it he can never again wander from the inmost truth of his being\n can i say more than that wiyout meditation wiyout meditation where is peace wiyout peace where is happiness the sine qua non of self knowledge is meditation\n the self is ever present but we do not perceive it because our vision is obscured by the illusion known as maya\n after describing the method of meditation krishna says if he practices meditation in this manner his heart will become pure and the self will become literally self evident\n in conclusion he remarks make a habit of practicing meditation and do not let your mind be distracted\n in this way you will come finally to the lord who is the light giver the highest of the high\n the formula the self can be known by those who truly desire to know\n and that true desire manifests through desisting from evil controlling of the senses quieting restraining the mind and practicing meditation\n this is the real formula for success\n the all consuming self somewhere along the line perhaps when they stopped killing their own people for sacrificial victims and committing genocide for the glory of their gods the religion of westerners lost its vigor\n spiritual came to be equated with the insubstantial and ethereal degenerating in time into an airy and vaporous sentimentalism of the sickliest character\n languishing in love for god became an ideal along with nobly bearing the terrible burdens god threw onto a groaning and groveling humanity\n the keynote of all this was passivity and not a passivity born of true courage or nobility but from a crushing sense of impotence and hopelessness\n hell became exalted to heaven and the contempt of a capricious and tyrannical god became divine love a love that demanded placation and acceptanceobedience\n this god of love hated a lot more things than he liked and basically tolerated nothing\n his religion in time became just like him and so did many of his devotees in attitude and deed\n since he was the ideal father they began treating their children just as he did his\n contemporary western society is the result\n even the rebellion against this madness is as hateful ignorant and repressive as that which is being supposedly rejected\n only the pious cover is discarded the evil core flourishes\n the utter insubstantiality of the spirituel has become a logical doorway to denial of any spiritual reality\n in the east india things are fundamentally different even if some of the sillier ways of western religion are also to be found there particularly in the bhakti movement\n the concept of the self as identified with the supreme self rather than a creation whose tenuous existence is continually threatened by the possibility of divine wrath has produced a psychology and a society the reverse of that found in the west\n the self is as eternal and immovable as god because it is one with god\n in the nineteenth century the remarkable poet author and mystic emily bronte became exposed to the upanishads and the bhagavad gita while studying in belgium\n she had long before instinctually rejected the ignorant religion of her childhood but now she had an intelligent basis for her rejection\n fortunately it took the form of affirmation rather than negation\n she had seen clearly when nine or so that she and all her sisters and brother would die young of the same disease tuberculosis and had written a poem about it\n when death was only a matter of weeks away she wrote this final poem no coward soul is mine no trembler in the world s storm troubled sphere i see heaven s glories shine and faith shines equal arming me from fear\n o god within my breast almighty ever present deity life that in me has rest as i undying life have power in thee vain are the yousand creeds that move men s hearts unutterably vain worthless as withered weeds or idlest froth amid the boundless main to waken doubt in one holding so fast by thy infinity so surely anchored on the steadfast rock of immortality\n with wide embracing love thy spirit animates eternal years pervades and broods above changes sustains dissolves creates and rears\n though earth and moon were gone and suns and universes ceased to be and thou wert left alone every existence would exist in thee\n there is not room for death nor atom that his might could render void thou you art being and breath and what you art may never be destroyed\n yama s analysis of the self has had a very logical progression\n then he tosses out to nachiketa a single incredible sentence to him brahmins and kshatriyas are but food and death itself a condiment\n all that we consider woryour of respect either venerable brahmain or powerful kshatriya is but a snack to the everlasting self\n even death which is ever with us and seemingly rules our destiny is but a flavoring for the self at its feast of life adding spice\n yama s words are reminiscent of arjuna s vision of the universal self in the eleventh chapter of the bhagavad gita\n since the individual atman and the paramatman are one they have the same qualities\n just as arjuna saw that all things emanate from the supreme and are reabsorbed in the supreme are eaten by it so it is with the self\n all that is us has come from the self and shall return to the self\n the self is the eternal immortal source of that which we think is temporal and perishable\n but only the forms are such\n their essence is the self\n unborn the self moves through many births\n formless the self inhabits many forms\n untouched the self encounters a myriad objects\n unconditioned the self manifests countless qualities\n remaining what it is the self appears to be all that it is not\n all that it encounters is but its repast and its births and deaths merely a sauce\n licking with your burning tongues devouring all the worlds you probe the heights of heaven the divine indwellers both the individual self and the universal self have entered the cave of the heart the abode of the most high but the knowers of brahman and the householders who perform the fire sacrifices see a difference between them as between sunshine and shadow\n the two selves there are two selves the many individual selves and the one universal self\n the mundaka upanishad likens them to two birds of the same appearance who sit in the same tree\n first we come to know the individual self and that enables us to attain the knowledge of the all inclusive self\n how the two exist as one yet two is incomprehensible to the intellect but is readily experienced by the inmost consciousness of the persevering yogi\n yet intellectually we need to have some grasp of the unity duality otherwise we can have no correct perspective on anything inner or outer\n extreme dualism is an error and monism of any kind is even worse in its simplisticism\n for this reason the enlightened use the expression non dual advaita as the nearest we can come to conveying the truth of our existence\n the verse beginning purnamadah purnamidam is usually interpreted as a statement that the relative has come from the transcendent while retaining essential unity with the transcendent\n but it can also be understood as referring to the individual self that exists rooted in the universal self\n it the atman originates in the supreme self the paramatman and is never separate from that self\n if examined the two will be seen to be one\n how is it possible the one alone knows and those who have united their consciousness with the one through yoga\n the cave of the heart it is easy to see that the individual self abides in and as the heart hridaya but when we look at the vast manifestation of cosmic life we call creation it is natural for our awareness to be drawn outward and thereby forget that the supreme self is right there inside in the same space akasha \n the paramatman is not in the cave of our heart only incidentally since it is everywhere but that is its abode its native place its center\n its manifestation can be found everywhere but it can be found only in the cave of the heart\n only that yogi whose joy is inward inward his peace and his vision inward shall come to brahman and know nirvana\n great is that yogi who seeks to be with brahman greater than those who mortify the body greater than the learned greater than the doers of good works therefore arjuna become a yogi\n how foolish to climb mountains delve into the earth wander across the plains or cross the seas thinking to find the abode of god which is the heart alone\n the two knowers there are those who know brahman directly and those who possess a secondary knowledge based on intuition resulting from their seeking of brahman\n though only the first really know brahman yet the others knowing about brahman is of such a character that it can lead them on to the direct knowledge of the illumined\n both of these have the same understanding wiyout contradiction\n therefore the finders never disdain the seekers\n the difference what do the finders and seekers know that the atman and the paramatman yough one are as different as sunshine and shadow\n but not in the sense of being opposite or antithetical to one another\n rather it means that the individual self exists only because the supreme self exists just as a shadow can only exist because of the light\n as the rig veda says of the supreme self his shadow is immortality\n also the idea is that the individual self jivatman is a reflection of the supreme self paramatman \n later yama will say he shining everything shines\n the aspiration since the foregoing is true the next verse of the upanishad says may we perform the nachiketa sacrifice which bridges the world of suffering\n may we know the imperishable brahman who is fearless and who is the end and refuge of those who seek liberation\n what is the nachiketa sacrifice it is not a secret fire ritual that produces a magical enlightenment\n the nachiketa sacrifice is the determined search for knowledge jnana which stops not until the goal is reached\n that is this the correct understanding is demonstrated by the results desired by the sacrificer the knowledge of brahman\n the search for union with god is the bridge which we cross to be free from this world of suffering\n seeking god is itself the guarantee that we shall find him\n many who lack confidence worry as to whether they can succeed in spiritual life if they are ready and so forth\n but the very fact that they wish to find god means that they have already travelled far along the path in previous lives\n otherwise they would sleep along with most of the world\n for the man who has once asked the way to brahman goes further than any mere fulfiller of the vedic rituals\n the scriptures declare that merit can be acquired by studying the vedas performing ritualistic sacrifices pracit ising austerities and giving alms\n but the yogi who has understood this teaching of mine will gain more than any who do these things\n he will reach that universal source which is the uttermost abode of god\n truly may we know the imperishable brahman who is fearless and who is the end and refuge of those who seek liberation\n the chariot perhaps the most perfect simile of our condition as human beings as we meander through the labyrinth of continual birth and death is that given in the katha upanishad and it is woryour of careful analysis\n know that the self is the rider and the body the chariot that the intellect is the charioteer and the mind the reins\n the first idea set forth in this verse is the completely inactive role of the individual self atman \n the other ingredients in the list are actively involved in living but the atman is absolutely beyond any activity and is merely the observer\n this is because its nature is pure consciousness and nothing else\n body chariot the body is the chariot a conglomerate of parts wiyout any consciousness or will of its own\n did anyone else out there grow up hearing certain fundamentalists say i don t sin but my body sins yet being pervaded by the intellect buddhi it does seem to have a mind of its own\n it does not but it is an extension expression of the mind and as such has great relevance to the spiritual aspirant\n sri ramakrishna used to study the physical configuration of newcomers and thereby determine their spiritual qualifications\n so we must think of the body as an inert thing\n it is alive but alive through the indwelling spirit\n we may not be the body but the body is certainly an expression of ourself\n the body is not only the vehicle of our accumulated karmas it is the embodiment of them\n our karmas are incarnated in the body much more than is the self\n intellect charioteer the intellect is the charioteer\n our movement through life is solely through the agency of the intellect the buddhi\n this is why krishna speaks of buddhi yoga as the process of liberation\n yoga is solely under the supervision of the buddhi\n yoga takes place both through the buddhi and within the buddhi\n this gives us a tremendous insight into the nature of liberation it is totally a matter of intellect of reconstruction of awareness\n the wise certainly undertake many external even physical disciplines to assist in their practice of yoga but all of these are intended to affect the buddhi in its striving towards enlightenment\n since the buddhi is the charioteer its quality determines everything in life\n the cultivation of our buddhi then must be the focus of our sadhana\n any humanimal can be taught asanas and pranayama but only the developed human can engage in real yoga\n if you think this previous statement is extreme let me tell you something i learned early on in my yoga life\n in i was privileged to meet and listen to the venerable a\n purani the administrator of the renowned aurobindo ashram\n sri purani had been a fellow revolutionary with the future great master sri aurobindo ghosh who incidentally was a high school teacher and inspirer of paramhansa yogananda \n later he became his disciple and lived in the ashram for many years before the master s passing\n during one of his brilliant discourses at the east west cultural center in hollywood sri purani told of an experience he had while travelling to the united states\n he had stopped over in japan where he was invited to speak to a yoga group in tokyo\n this group taught and practiced only hatha yoga asanas and pranayama \n at the conclusion of his talk sri purani asked them would you agree that the greatest yogis of recent times were sri ramakrishna sri aurobindo and sri ramana maharshi they expressed unanimous assent to this statement\n yet he pointed out not one of them practiced hatha yoga\n so why do you consider yourselves yogis when you only practice that which they never bothered with no matter how many external assists we may use yoga is essentially of the buddhi alone\n mind reins and the mind the reins\n by mind manah is meant the sensory mind the intermediary between the intellect and the body and the entire world as well\n through the mind the intellect sees whether the body should act or be still\n for example the mind conveys the sensation of a hand burning to the intellect which then directs the body again through the mind to pull the hand away from the fire and plunge it in cold water or some such remedy\n the next element in the matter are the senses wiyout which the mind would have nothing to show the intellect\n therefore sense horses the senses say the wise are the horses the roads they travel are the mazes of desire\n it is the senses that drag the chariot of the body along according to their impulses\n if the buddhi is weak or underdeveloped the mind which is driven by pain pleasure motivation alone takes complete charge in giving full rein to the senses\n having no intelligence they plunge onward ever seeking fulfillment and not finding it hurtling even further on the paths of unreason and folly\n for the roads they travel are the mazes of desire rather than intelligence\n as a consequence the individual becomes hopelessly lost and mired in the morass of external sensation\n enslavement to body and senses is the only possible consequence death in life and ultimately death in actuality of the body and senses\n self definition who am i is the gate to real understanding for it sets us seeking true knowledge\n and the upanishadic verse continues the wise call the self the enjoyer when he is united with the body the senses and the mind\n we certainly do not enjoy a great deal of our experiences in through the body so perhaps a better translation of bhokta is experiencer rather than enjoyer\n the major idea in this verse is that the self is the actionless consciousness that experiences the intellect mind senses and body\n as a consequence we can understand that the self is never the doer at any time\n the gita illumines this for us saying every action is really performed by the gunas sensory energies \n man deluded by his egoism thinks i am the doer\n but he who has the true insight into the operations of the gunas and their various functions knows that when senses attach themselves to objects gunas are merely attaching themselves to gunas\n knowing this he does not become attached to his actions\n you dream you are the doer\n let the wise man know these gunas alone as the doers of every action let him learn to know that which is beyond them also\n there is more material like this but the sum is the truly admirable man controls his senses by the power of his will\n this is because the senses are said to be higher than the sense objects\n the mind is higher than the senses\n the intelligent will is higher than the mind\n what is higher than the intelligent will the atman itself\n the practical application when a man lacks discrimination and his mind is uncontrolled his senses are unmanageable like the restive horses of a charioteer\n but when a man has discrimination and his mind is controlled his senses like the well broken horses of a charioteer lightly obey the rein\n and more he who lacks discrimination whose mind is unsteady and whose heart is impure never reaches the goal but is born again and again\n but he who has discrimination whose mind is steady and whose heart is pure reaches the goal and having reached it is born no more\n the man who has a sound understanding for charioteer a controlled mind for reins he it is that reaches the end of the journey the supreme abode of vishnu the all pervading\n the chariot s journey the upanishadic seers have just told us that the self in the body is like a driver in a chariot\n now they set the intended journey before us\n the senses derive from physical objects physical objects from mind mind from intellect intellect from ego ego from the unmanifested seed and the unmanifested seed from brahman the uncaused cause\n brahman is the end of the journey\n brahman is the supreme goal\n it is the genealogy of perception that is being outlined here for if we reverse the order of perception we will come to perceive the source the eternal witness itself\n this verse then is a exposition of the chain or progression of consciousness\n according to it the hierarchy of perception is brahman purusha unmanifested seed avyaktam ego atma mahan the great self or mahat tattwa intellect buddhi mind manas senses indriyas physical objects arthas the bhagavad gita gives a similar but simpler list relating exclusively to the individual microcosm rather than the universal macrocosm but we can translate the foregoing list to relate to us as individual beings jivas \n in that case we get the self the unmanifested yet out turned will energy the sense of i am the intellect the mind the senses the sense organs\n my list is more literal than that of swami prabhavananda\n it is not more meritorious when considering the cosmos but it is better when looking at the situation of the individual being\n having descended the ladder how do we get back up especially sense we have no memory of how we managed the descent luckily for us the yogis of india figured that out for us untold eons ago and it works as well today as it did then\n meditation is the way of ascent back to awareness of the self\n it is possible to work our way back up the ladder for the rungs are not disparate elements but evolutes or emanations of those above them\n if all the rungs including the senses themselves were not extensions of the self we could not reach back to the self\n this is as true on the microcosmic level as it is on the macrocosmic\n fortunately brahman has not fallen and forgotten itself but it too withdraws and projects himself as creation as we do ourselves by coming into manifestation and eventually into physical birth\n as above so below has many ramifications\n the destination and how to get there brahman is the end of the journey\n brahman is the supreme goal\n but the simple saying counts for little\n so the upanishad continues this brahman this self deep hidden in all beings is not revealed to all but to the seers pure in heart concentrated in mind to them is he revealed\n who sees brahman the sukshma darshibhih those who can see the subtle the inmost reality\n how then can we become seers of the subtle by continually developing our capacity for inner perception and simultaneously refining our inner faculties\n to do that we must go inside in meditation and work with our inner mechanism called the antahkarana by the yogis\n as the taittiriya upanishad says seek to know brahman by meditation\n and om is brahman\n he who meditates on om attains to brahman\n within the lotus of the heart he dwells where like the spokes of a wheel in its hub the nerves meet\n meditate on him as om\n easily mayest you cross the sea of darkness\n the mind may be compared to a firestick the syllable om to another\n rub the two sticks together by repeating the sacred syllable and meditating on brahman and the flame of knowledge will be kindled in your heart and all impurities will be burnt away\n let your body be the stick that is rubbed the sacred syllable om the stick that is rubbed against it\n thus shall you realize god who is hidden within the body as fire is hidden within the wood\n turning back the senses of the wise man obey his mind his mind obeys his intellect his intellect obeys his ego and his ego obeys the self\n this too is the product effect of meditation meditation is the establishing of order within and wiyout\n marching orders arise awake approach the feet of the master and know that\n in point of fact the text does not say approach the feet of the master but prapya varan which means having attained boons\n the idea is to seek and attain kripa grace\n actually the scriptures speak of three kinds of kripa sadhana kripa the grace of self effort guru kripa the grace of a teacher and divya kripa divine grace\n this wise will gain all three\n but there is no denying that kripa is a requisite for those who having arisen and awakened seek brahman\n the path the verse continues like the sharp edge of a razor the sages say is the path\n narrow it is and difficult to tread immediately we think of jesus words enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it\n because popular religion despite its attempt to entice followers continually implies or outright states that spiritual life is hard i grew up with this in fundamentalist protestanit ism and found it outrageous we tend to look at the principles of sanatana dharma with a tainted perspective\n the upanishad is not telling us in the manner of western religion how hard it will be to follow the way of life\n the clue to difficulty in spiritual is found in the description of the path as like the sharp edge of a razor\n the idea is that the path is extremely subtle not arduous\n but that makes it all the more difficult even impossible for those of coarse minds\n this and this alone is what makes the path hard to tread\n no spiritual discipline comes near to being as hard as the things human beings commonly do every day to get the things they want\n and want is the operative word\n if we do not want a thing then any action needed to obtain it will be tedious and too hard\n but if we want it intensely then no effort is too much or too hard\n that is why the thirty fourth ode of solomon says there is no hard way where there is a simple heart nor any barrier where the youghts are upright\n nor is there any whirlwind in the depth of the illuminated yought\n where one is surrounded on every side by pleasing country there is nothing divided in him\n so the problem is in us not in the path\n here as in the last essay we see that the solution is to refine our consciousness through meditation\n we must also refine our physical and mental bodes through purity of yought and deed and especially purity of diet\n the ingesting of animal flesh alcohol nicotine and mind affecting drugs is a frontal attack on spiritual life\n it is completely insane for a seeker to engage in such destructive habits and they are addictions \n the subtle goal the absolute necessity for refinement of perception through refinement of all the levels of our being is revealed by the nature of the path s goal soundless formless intangible undying tasteless odorless wiyout beginning wiyout end eternal immutable beyond nature is the self\n knowing him as such one is freed from death\n we must become able to hear silence see the formless touch the untouchable live to the immortal taste the tasteless perceive the fragrance of the odorless and transcend all relative measure and even relativity itself\n such a state is verily inconceivable to us at the present\n but it can be achieved through yoga\n let us arise awake pass from death unto life and lay hold of immortality\n the glorious way the katha upanishad is now going to elaborate on the path so we can better understand how to journey upon it\n the self existent made the senses turn outward\n accordingly man looks toward what is wiyout and sees not what is within\n rare is he who longing for immortality shuts his eyes to what is wiyout and beholds the self\n why the first thing this verse teaches us is that the divine itself has caused our consciousness to turn outward\n this is not the result of any negative force or fall on our part\n the fall took place as a wrong response to the outward turn\n what was the purpose of our turning outward evolution\n we had to enter into relative existence and run the maze of ever ascending evolution in order to sait isfy our innate urge for infinity\n for more on this see \n consequently there is nothing wrong with the senses turning outward the problem is when the sense become locked in externalizing\n the purpose of our entering the field of evolutionary life was for us to experience the many shades of evolving consciousness while never losing awareness of our true nature or identifying with the costumes we constantly donned and put off as the ages progressed\n however it may have been intended the situation has horribly changed making us blind to inner realities\n sunk in awareness of seeming mortality human beings either seek to distract themselves from the terror and pain which arises from their delusion or they seek some way to attain immortality\n both searches are based on delusion so they can only fail\n we need not become immortal but must realize our present eternal immortal nature\n those who shut their eyes their consciousness to the false appearances of external existence and turn within discover the truth of their immortality\n no longer do they think that the solution is to be found in some external factor but clearly see that their own self is the wondrous answer\n the foolish and the wise fools follow the desires of the flesh and fall into the snare of all encompassing death but the wise knowing the self as eternal seek not the things that pass away\n in its true state relative existence is a vast field of life but when it is overlain with the veneer of our inner delusions it becomes death to us\n that which is meant to expand our consciousness and free us into infinity becomes a prison a killer of our soul and this is all our doing\n the world remains what it ever was but we have lost sight of its nature just as we have become blind to our own self\n the urge to expansion of consciousness through upward moving evolution becomes distorted into a myriad desires arising from our false identity with the body and its illusory mortality\n seize the moment is our despairing cry\n seeking to live we plunge ourselves into the snare of allencompassing death\n the wise who have come to know their immortality through the direct experience produced only by meditation turn from the snare and seek only that which cannot pass away because it has never come into being at some point in time but is immortal like us\n in other words we seek the kingdom of god that is nothing less than god and our own self\n there is a seeking that is necessary but a seeking for deepening consciousness rather than for something that is not already ours\n we must not fall into the facile illusion that we have nothing to do or attain\n certainly there is nothing objective to be done or attained but in the subjective realm of consciousness there is literally everything to be sought and attained\n strive wiyout ceasing to know the atman seek this knowledge and comprehend clearly why you should seek it such it is said are the roots of true wisdom\n to know the self defining the self recently i read of a yogi who was asked what is the self the yogi answered the one who knows the mind\n how simple and the answer to the query who what is god is equally simple the one who enables the self to know the mind and who knows the self as its self\n he through whom man sees tastes smells hears feels and enjoys is the omniscient lord\n all the doors of perception function through the divine presence not just the divine power\n our consciousness is the consciousness of god the finite drawn from the infinite as the wave draws its existence from the ocean\n it is a grave error to decry the experience of our senses as either illusory or somehow degrading\n it is our response to sensory experience that is often illusory or degrading\n but we are at every moment living in and by god\n but god is not just the power by which we live and move and have our being\n he verily is the immortal self\n knowing him one knows all things\n he is the all embracing consciousness within our consciousness and within all things\n if we come to know enter into the being of that infinite one we shall know with his knowing and therefore know all things\n as saint paul said now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known\n this is the inmost meaning of saint john s statement beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is\n he through whom man experiences the sleeping or waking states is the all pervading self\n knowing him one grieves no more\n all states of consciousness are directly rooted in the self individual and universal\n when through yoga this is truly known all grief ceases for the yogi identifies with his allperceiving self\n he transcends fear as well for he who knows that the individual soul enjoyer of the fruits of action is the self ever present within lord of time past and future casts out all fear\n for this self is the immortal self\n what an incredible statement we are thinking that we are poor mortal beings swept along by forces alien to us and totally beyond our control when all the time we are the masters of past and future\n all our fear comes from our unawareness of this glorious fact\n by turning inward and discovering the truth of ourself we will pass beyond fear\n the message of the upanishads is inseparably bound up with the necessity for sadhana if it is not to be no more than dead words on a dead page\n seeing truly he who sees the first born born of the mind of brahma born before the creation of waters and sees him inhabiting the lotus of the heart living among physical elements sees brahman indeed\n for this first born is the immortal self\n the only way to see true is to see the true\n when we turn within to the core of our being there we will not only find the individual self the jiva or atman but we will find its origin the supreme self the paramatman the eternal brahman\n this is the true vision of god that in which the two are seen to be one alyough their distinction is eternal\n the word born is misleading for the self is never born\n there does come a time when it becomes manifest in relative creation but it existed before that birth\n it is not even right to say that god is our origin for the self is co eternal with god\n as krishna told arjuna there was never a time when i did not exist nor you nor any of these kings\n nor is there any future in which we shall cease to be\n the all embracing self it is no news to us that god not only is within all things but in an ineffable way is all things\n but there is a further fact we too embrace all the levels of being on the finite level just as does god on the infinite level\n so the upanishads further says that being who is the power of all powers and is born as such who embodies himself in the elements and in them exists and who has entered the lotus of the heart is the immortal self\n again this refers to both the finite and the infinite spirits\n therefore we see that in the vision of the upanishadic sages we are not abstract spirits with no connection whatever with the energies of prakriti\n rather as with god those energies are our own expanded and frozen energies that in time are to be revealed as consciousness and assimilated into our self from which they have never really been separate\n in the final sense there is no matter or energy at all\n yet at the moment we find ourselves in the seemingly manifold condition that is necessary for our evolution and ultimate freedom\n we not only mistake our own nature we mistake the nature of god as well\n we are ourselves the power of all powers having willingly embodied ourselves in subtle and gross matter while still living essentially in the lotus of the heart\n how then can we consider ourselves the servants or slaves of any being including god there is no work of god in this world for us to do only our work the ascension to perfect freedom\n there is a theism that is bondage and a theism that is freedom\n we must discriminate between the two\n the source because it fits better with the foregoing let us skip a verse and read that in which the sun rises and in which it sets that which is the source of all the powers of nature and of the senses that which nothing can transcend that is the immortal self\n the self and the supreme self are both the chidakasha the sky or ether of consciousness in which the sun of manifested life rises and sets\n the waking dreaming and deep sleep states take place within the consciousness that is the self\n the experience of birth and death likewise take place within the self\n the self is like the supreme self the source of the energies that manifest as the various levels of the subtle and gross bodies which we are presently evolving until they manifest as the spirit self\n nothing is ever destroyed but is resolved back into its origin the spirit\n this is the great and awesome assertion of the upanishads\n nothing is beyond or higher than the self not even god for god and the self are essentially one as are the ocean and the waves\n as long as we dream of separation so long will we continue to come and go suffering the pain and fear of continual change\n but when we awaken into unity all sorrow and fear cease forever\n the power of enlightenment agni the all seeing who lies hidden in fire sticks like a child well guarded in the womb who is worshiped day by day by awakened souls and by those who offer oblations in sacrificial fire he is the immortal self\n according to the researches of sri aurobindo agni the supposed god of fire is really the will power of the individual which manifests specifically in the practice of yoga\n this is not the whimsical will power of egoic goals but the will to liberate our consciousness from all bonds\n this manifests exclusively in spiritual practice not in philosophizing or in feeling spiritual\n this is the highest form of action possible to any being in relativity and merits our careful analysis\n hidden in fire sticks the fire for the vedic sacrifice is kindled by the friction of two sticks\n the upanishad uses this as a simile saying that the yogic fire lies hidden in fire sticks\n both the kaivalya and the swetashwatara upanishads explain this as follows\n the mind may be compared to a firestick the syllable om to another\n rub the two sticks together by repeating the sacred syllable and meditating on brahman and the flame of knowledge will be kindled in your heart and all impurities will be burnt away\n fire yough present in the firesticks is not perceived until one stick is rubbed against another\n the self is like that fire it is realized in the body by meditation on the sacred syllable om\n not only is the will to practice meditation produced by meditation on om so is the goal enlightenment\n like a child well guarded in the womb the propensity toward the divine is rare and it is also fragile because the downward pull accumulated in yousands of previous lives threaten its very existence\n consequently the wise sadhaka guards it well once it arises ensuring that it can grow unhindered and in time come forth as the liberating force we need to be successful yogis\n the observance of yama and niyama are absolutely essential in this as is the need to reorder one s life so as not to put this developing power in danger of harm or destruction\n worshiped day by day by awakened souls the idea of the previous section is being continued\n the awakened yough no yet enlightened soul cherishes the yogic will and realizes that it is a worshipful thing the godward tending divine power of the divine self that moves within him like an embryo within the womb\n day by day he worships it by using it to meditate\n those who offer oblations in sacrificial fire those who are consciously engaging in ishwarapranidhana the offering of the life to god extend the power of their spiritual will beyond the practice of meditation into every moment of their life and activity using it to accomplish a spiritualized mode of life\n here too the necessity for reordering the life of the sadhaka is evident\n may that divine agni be enkindled and maintained within us\n the infinite self what is within us is also wiyout\n what is wiyout is also within\n he who sees difference between what is within and what is wiyout goes evermore from death to death\n these words have various levels of meaning and we should consider them all\n microcosms many years ago dr\n judith tyberg a disciple of sri aurobindo and director of the east west cultural center in los angeles told me that she had attended a lecture at benares hindu university in which a map of the universe and charts from gray s anatomy were compared and seen to be strikingly alike\n our bodies are little models of the universe\n some months before she told this to me i had experienced this for myself\n while meditating one day all ordinary physical sensation vanished\n spatial relation ceased to exist and i found myself keenly aware of being beyond dimension neither large nor small but infinite for infinity is beyond size \n alyough the terminology is inappropriate to such a state to make it somewhat understandable i have to say that i perceived an infinity of worlds within me\n suns some solo and others surrounded by planets glimmered inside my spaceless space\n not that i saw the light but i felt or intuited it\n actually i did not see anything and yet i did\n it is not expressible in terms of ordinary sense experience yet i must use those terms\n i experienced myself as everything that existed within the relative material universe\n or so it seemed for the human body is a miniature universe a microcosmic model of the macrocosm\n the physical human body is a reflection of the universal womb that conceived it\n i had experienced the subtle level of the physical body that is its ideational i\n on that level it can be experienced as a map of the material creation\n in this matter it was crucial that i not mistake the copy for the original and think i was an infinite being or had attained cosmic consciousness\n it was macrocosmic consciousness not an insignificant experience but certainly not the final step in evolution\n as above so below in the hermetic philosophy of the ancient mediterranean world there was a principle as above so below\n that is this material plane of existence is a mirroring of higher levels of being all the way up to the absolute\n therefore by studying earthly phenomena we can gain some idea of heavenly things\n also that material conditions are reflections of psychic forces\n astrology is an example of this\n the physical planets through universal gravitation certainly have some influence on our physical being but their movements are indications of the arising and subsiding of inner subtle energies that greatly affect us both psychologically and externally\n we need to realize that the inner is always more real than the outer\n the thirty fourth ode of solomon one of the earliest christian hymns says the likeness of that which is below is that which is above\n for everything is above and below there is nothing but it is believed to be by those in whom there is no knowledge\n this is also true in yoga\n everything real happens in the head the sahasrara the thousand petalled lotus the astral causal brain\n this is why paramhansa nityananda told his students awareness buddhi should be concentrated in the head\n your attention should always be above the neck never below the neck\n yogis should never look to or trust phenomena that take place in the body below the sahasrara\n outer inner the outer is the inner the inner is the outer\n we have touched on this slightly\n it is of inestimable importance to realize that our outer life is but a mirror image of our inner life that whatever is taking place in our external body and environment is happening in the depths of our mind\n so by studying and analyzing our outer life we come to gauge the true character of our inner life\n this is not palatable to the ego for it means that our misfortunes are our own doing and reveal our inner negativity\n as the chinese maxim has it when mean spirited people live behind the door mean spirited people come in front of the door\n so let us be careful before we indulge in a litany of all the wrongs we have suffered and all the bad people that have done those wrongs to us\n we will only be confessing our own sins\n it is not sympayour we need but self correction\n as a very wise book the astral city says self pity is a symptom of mental illness\n consistency it is also necessary that our inner and outer lives be identical\n we are all aware that very corrupt people can act and speak in a seemingly virtuous way\n also many soft hearted people pretend to be callous or even prickly\n but neither is admirable\n what you see is what you get should be our rule of life\n our outer life must be an exact imaging of our inner life\n in the gospel of thomas section jesus tells his disciples that they will enter the kingdom of god when you make the two one and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside and the above like the below\n the inner and outer reality god is the inner and god is the outer\n he who sees difference between what is within and what is wiyout goes evermore from death to death\n we are bound to the cycle of perpetual births and deaths until we see god both within and wiyout until we know that god is the sole reality of both the world and ourselves\n in that vision we become immortal\n the great swami sivananda wrote the following expressing this truth when i surveyed from ananda kutir rishikesh by the side of the tehri hills only god i saw\n in the ganges and the kailas peak in the famous chakra tirtha of naimisar also only god i saw\n in tribulation and in grief in joy and in glee in sickness and in sorrow only god i saw\n in birds and dogs in stones and trees in flowers and fruits in the sun moon and stars only god i saw\n in the rosy cheeks of kashmiri ladies in the black faces of african negroes only god i saw\n in filth and scents in poison and dainties in the market and in society only god i saw\n in brahmakara vritti and vedantic nididhyasana in atmic vichara and atmic chintana only god i saw\n in kirtan and nama smaran in sravana and vandana in archana and padasevana in dasya and atmanivedana only god i saw\n like camphor i was melting in his fire of knowledge amidst the flames outflashing only god i saw\n my prana entered the brahmarandhra at the moordha then i looked with god s eyes only god i saw\n i passed away into nothingness i vanished and lo i was the all living only god i saw\n i enjoyed the divine aisvarya all god s vibhuit is i had visvaroopa darshan the cosmic consciousness only god i saw\n glory glory unto the lord hail hail hail o sweet ram\n let me sing once more thy name ram ram ram om om om only god i saw\n the seeing mind jesus who said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god had learned this well in india\n for the next verse of the katha upanishad tells us by the purified mind alone is the indivisible brahman to be attained\n brahman alone is nothing else is\n he who sees the manifold universe and not the one reality goes evermore from death to death\n the necessary purification is profound for saint john tells us every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he god is pure\n those whose minds have been made pure in the contemplation of god automatically see him\n as patanjali explains god is a spirit \n his designator is om\n its constant repetition and meditation is the way\n from it result the disappearance of obstacles and the turning inward of consciousness\n and more importantly they attain god as the upanishad says\n they come to know themselves as gods within god\n the universe and ourselves are in an ineffable way part of the indivisible brahman\n that is why jesus said this is life eternal that they might know you the only true god\n and why the upanishad tell us that he who sees the manifold universe and not the one reality goes evermore from death to death\n the upanishad calls us to see god and enter into life eternal\n the dweller in the heart for numberless ages in the rest of the world people were intent on the awesome greatness of god and nothing more\n whereas in india the sages were intent on the awesome greatness of both the individual and the universal selves\n perceiving their unity they understood that whatever can be said about one can be said about the other\n thus their teachings are a unique revelation of the true nature of us all\n wiyout this self understanding our life is nothing but confusion with a few random stumblings into insight\n it is an absolute necessity that we comprehend the upanishadic teachings and strive to gain the upanishadic vision\n in the lotus of the heart that being of the size of a thumb dwells deep within the heart\n he is the lord of time past and future\n having attained him one fears no more\n he verily is the immortal self\n this verse tells us several things about our true self\n that being of the size of a thumb dwells deep within the heart\n since the self transcends space how can it have a measurable size it cannot\n shankara explains in his commentary that the lotus of the heart is of the size of a thumb\n existing in the space within the lotus of the heart the self has the size of a thumb just like space existing in a section of a bamboo that is of the size of a thumb\n just as water filling a vessel sunk in the ocean has volume and shape in the same way the self seems to have a shape and a measure\n but once the vessel is broken the shape and volume of the water cease to be and so it is with the self\n incarnate in a body the self pervades it and reflects it but upon the dissolution of the body those seeming conditions cease instantly for they have no objective reality\n so it is not the self that is really of the size of a thumb but rather the lotus of the heart within which it momentarily dwells\n we should not mistake the lotus of the heart for the organ that pumps blood through the body\n the real lotus of the heart is the core of the thousand petalled lotus the sahasrara located in the head\n this thumb shaped nucleus is also referred to in yogic teachings as the linga in the head\n deep within the heart indicates that the self is the inmost level of our being our absolute essence beyond which we simply do not exist\n it also indicates that to know ourself we must meditate and penetrate deep into our consciousness\n there is no other way\n he is the lord of time past and future\n it is a grave error to think that we are helpless flotsam and jetsam on the bosom of the ocean of relativity being moved about by forces such as karma our youghts and even god\n it is our own self that determines whatever happens to us and is the sole controller of our past present and future\n look at the chaotic lives of those who trust in god and surrender to the divine will\n they rationalize their disordered state by saying they have peace of mind through their attitude but that is a poor substitute for the truth\n look at how many people die peacefully\n peace counts for little when it is nothing more than an opiate\n we must stop living a lie\n it is not our karma our thinking or even god that ordains our life\n it is our self\n and until we unite our awareness with the self we shall know nothing but uncertainty and confusion\n but when we do sorrow melts into that clear peace which is ours forever\n having attained him one fears no more\n for what can produce fear in the knower of the self as emily bronte wrote o god within my breast almighty ever present deity life that in me has rest as i undying life have power in thee vain are the yousand creeds that move men s hearts unutterably vain worthless as withered weeds or idlest froth amid the boundless main to waken doubt in one holding so fast by thy infinity so surely anchored on the steadfast rock of immortality\n the smokeless flame that being of the size of a thumb is like a flame wiyout smoke\n he is the lord of time past and future the same today and tomorrow\n he verily is the immortal self\n now we learn some more essential facts about our self\n like a flame wiyout smoke\n the self is pure light wiyout covering or admixture\n in our present state of delusion we think that the self can be inhibited and even corrupted but that is not so\n the various energy levels within which the self is dwelling certainly can be inhibited corrupted and even destroyed\n if we identify with those levels we will live in fear and uncertainty relieved only occasionally by utterly false hopes\n it is your ignorance it is the world s delusion that gives you these dreams of both hope and fear\n but once our consciousness is posited in the self all that is past dispelled by the eternal light of the self\n the same today and tomorrow\n the changeless nature of the self puts us beyond all fear concern and anxiety knowing it birthless knowing it deathless knowing it endless for ever unchanging\n the self really has no past present or future\n it is itself the eternal now\n liberating unity as rain fallen on a hill streams down its side so runs he after many births who sees manifoldness in the self\n the gravity of delusion pulls inexorably downward those who think that the many layers of their incarnate existence are the self\n yet they do not think they are enslaved by the consequences of their ignorance but think they have free will as they run into the valleys of darkness and pain\n it s my life and i will do what i want to they shout as they roll downward into the jaws of sorrow and death\n only when the unity of our self is known both in the fact of its unitary state of being and its eternal oneness with brahman will the earthward pull disappear along with the compulsion to continual rebirth\n if a man sees brahman in every action he will find brahman\n it is as simple as that\n ever the same as pure water poured into pure water remains pure so does the self remain pure o nachiketa uniting with brahman\n we and brahman are one substance\n there is no difference\n we are not creations we are beginningless and endless co eternal with god\n knowing this makes all the difference the only difference we need\n brahman is pure being and we are pure being\n uniting with brahman we remain what we always have been but no longer subject to ignorance and delusion\n as jesus said him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out\n the self does not change but becomes irrevocably established in the consciousness of its changelessness\n the birthless self the subject of the self is virtually inexhaustible\n it is the sole object of the upanishads\n so yamaraj continues to expound the self to nachiketa\n to the birthless the light of whose consciousness forever shines belongs the city of eleven gates\n he who meditates on the ruler of that city knows no more sorrow\n he attains liberation and for him there can no longer be birth or death\n for the ruler of that city is the immortal self\n this verse tells us many aspects of the self each of which should be scrutinized in turn\n birthless a cornerstone of eastern wisdom is the understanding that verbal formulas can never encompass the truth but can only be hints albeit excellent hints that truth is always beyond books concepts and words that in time the aspirant must pass beyond them into the level of spiritual intuition in which direct knowledge is possible\n yet it is understood that the aspirant will not be able to fully translate such direct knowledge into words\n as the adage says he who knows tells it not he who tells knows it not\n not from an attitude of arcane secrecy always a symptom of spiritual pathology but from the fact that knowing transcends speech and discursive yought\n nevertheless according to your faith be it unto you\n and faith is conceptual even if not fully verbal\n consequently our ideas about ourselves our nature and our life have a profound influence on our life and its unfoldment\n if we think we are sinful mortals we shall live like sinful mortals incapable of reaching god\n if we think we are evolving consciousness moving onward to spiritual heights we shall evolve beyond human limitations\n but if we think we are eternal beings part of god s infinite being we shall rise to the state of divine unity and manifest the declaration ye are gods\n it is necessary then for us to firmly set in mind that we are birthless beings that we have never come into being or been created\n rather we are co eternal with god the essence of our existence\n we never came into being nor shall we ever cease to be\n when we understand that our consciousness is somehow a wave of the infinite consciousness that is god that we are irrevocably a part of god s infinite light and life it will have a transforming effect on us\n sri ramakrishna was fond of the simile of a washerman s donkey\n each night the washerman passes a rope around the legs of the donkey and then removes it\n the donkey believes it has been tied so it never tries to move away from that spot\n its bondage is imaginary yet because of its belief it is as bound as yough it were tied\n it is the same with us\n if we believe we are bound we shall be bound\n but if we believe we are free we can manifest that freedom\n this is what yoga and yoga alone is all about\n the light of consciousness god cannot be defined but it can be said that god is light even more that god is the light that is life\n in other words god is conscious light\n and so are we\n if this is realized then we will not identify with the change and dissolution that is inherent in relative existence\n the hymn says change and decay in all around i see o thou who changest not abide with me\n the mistake is in thinking that what is needed is god as a separate being when what is really needed is the abiding awareness of our own self of which god is the essence\n as the psalmist sang i shall be sait isfied when i awake with your likeness\n when i awake i am still with you\n forever shines our divine nature may be obscured to our earthly eyes in the way that clouds can hide the sun and even make the earth dark\n but the sun ever shines\n night occurs because of the turning of the earth and spiritual ignorance and darkness arise because our awareness is turned wrong\n yet as buddha said turn around and lo the other shore\n and jesus said over and over the kingdom of heaven is at hand right here where it has always been\n it is only a matter of attunement of consciousness\n again that is where yoga comes in\n the self is what it is forever nothing can alter that\n so what we need is a recovering of consciousness\n it need not be produced or even gained only recognized\n this is difficult for us to grasp since we have become habituated to the ways of relativity in which everything is a process moving along in stages\n yoga reveals the truth of our selves and since the clouds of illusion have to be moved aside to reveal the ever shining self yoga appears to be a process too but essentially it is not\n yoga is simply seeing true\n the city of eleven gates the human body is usually called the city of nine gates for the nine apertures of the body but here it has the number eleven\n shankara says this is because the navel and the brahmarandhra the soft spot at the crown of the head are also being counted as gates\n this is appropriate as before birth we are nourished through the navel and at death we often depart through the brahmarandhra\n the important point that is being made here is in contradistinction to religions other than hinduism and even to the attitudes found today in contemporary indian philosophy\n for it is commonly yought very spiritual to disregard the body push it aside in our consciousness and despise it as a liability and even a prison\n but the upanishad tells us that the body is not alien to the self atman but rather belongs to the self just as the cosmos belongs to god and is in a sense the body of god\n it is important to continually keep in mind that whatever can be said of god can usually be said about the individual being as well\n the body is ours and is fundamentally a mirroring of our personal consciousness which is why we can legitimately speak of the body mind connection\n the body is the vehicle through which the individual evolves during the span of life on earth and must be taken into serious account by the yogi who will discover that the body can exert a necessary effect on the mind\n for example the yogi meditates and discovers that the process of yoga takes place in the yousand petalled lotus of the brain\n for as paramhansa nityananda said all takes place to a raja yogi in the brain center\n what is called raja yoga is above the neck\n furthermore the yogi joins the japa repetition of om to the breath a physical process known as pranayama\n the yogi who observes will discover that the diet of the physical body is also the diet of the mind that whatever is eaten physically will have an effect mentally\n one who does not know this is no yogi at all\n no more sorrow he who meditates on the ruler of that city knows no more sorrow\n when we meditate on our self our atman we will end all sorrow\n the gita says of the yogi who meditates on the self to obey the atman is his peaceful joy sorrow melts into that clear peace his quiet mind is soon established in peace\n when through the practice of yoga the mind ceases its restless movements and becomes still he realizes the atman\n it sait isfies him entirely\n then he knows that infinite happiness which can be realized by the purified heart but is beyond the grasp of the senses\n he stands firm in this realization\n because of it he can never again wander from the inmost truth of his being\n now that he holds it he knows this treasure above all others faith so certain shall never be shaken by heaviest sorrow\n to achieve this certainty is to know the real meaning of the word yoga\n it is the breaking of contact with pain\n you must practice this yoga resolutely wiyout losing heart\n we must meditate on the self not on external deities or symbolic forms of psychic states\n as sri ma sarada devi said after attaining wisdom one sees that gods and deities are all maya\n the upanishads gita and yoga sutras know nothing of meditating on ishta devatas only on om for om is our self\n here are a few upanishadic statements on the subject the self is of the nature of the syllable om\n directly realize the self by meditating on om\n the self is of the nature of the syllable om\n thus the syllable om is the very self\n meditate on om as the self\n om is the atman himself\n om is a single syllable that is of the nature of the self\n om is the true form of the self\n liberation no longer birth or death he attains liberation and for him there can no longer be birth or death\n there is no need for commentary but here is some corroboration know this atman unborn undying never ceasing never beginning deathless birthless how can it die the death of the body the seers reach enlightenment\n then they are free from the bondage of rebirth and pass to that state which is beyond all evil\n knowing the atman man finds nirvana that is in brahman here and hereafter\n immortal for the ruler of that city is the immortal self\n the gita encapsulates it perfectly this true wisdom i have taught will lead you to immortality\n the faithful practice it with devotion taking me for their highest aim\n to me they surrender heart and mind\n they are exceedingly dear to me\n for i am brahman within this body life immortal that shall not perish i am the truth and the joy for ever\n the shining self the immortal self is the sun shining in the sky he is the breeze blowing in space he is the fire burning on the altar he is the guest dwelling in the house he is in all men he is in the gods he is in the ether he is wherever there is truth he is the fish that is born in water he is the plant that grows in the soil he is the river that gushes from the mountain he the changeless reality the illimitable where in all the scriptures of the world can we find such a thrilling statement thrilling and glorious because it is true the two that are one to fully comprehend the teachings of the upanishadic sages we must keep in mind that whatever can be said of the paramatman on the cosmic universal level can usually also be said of the jivatman on the level of our individual life within the cosmos\n so the upanishads are describing not only god the supreme spirit but the nature of our own individual spirit\n what is needed there is another essential side to this upanishadic statement and indeed to all scriptural teachings that must be kept in mind at all times in our study we must experience and know the realities spoken of by the sages\n they did not write down their perceptions for us to merely accept them and be intellectually convinced of their veracity\n rather they wrote them down as signposts so we could check our own perceptions against them\n never did they mean for their writings to become dogmas and doctrines\n they assume that their readers will be yogis like themselves sadhaka pilgrims pressing on toward the ultimate frontiers of consciousness\n this is the absolutely unique character of the basic texts of sanatana dharma\n all other scriptures including those of later authorship in india as well as those of other religions are statements of truths we are supposed to accept on faith wiyout question\n this is why intelligent investigation and analysis are so little valued by the expounders of those scriptures why nearly all religions warn their adherents away from reading the books of heretics and demand that they shun their company\n intellectual fearlessness terrifies the chosen faithful and sets their teeth on edge\n but no religious system that employs a single bond can lead us to freedom\n for example in yoga yama and niyama are not commandments but helpful information\n just as we learn what food is harmful to the body so from patanjali we learn what conduct limits and clouds the consciousness of the aspiring yogi\n if we wish to ignore his counsel that is our own concern\n no one will call us to account for our heedlessness except our own self\n those who are fit to be yogis joyfully learn what to cultivate and what to avoid and live accordingly\n those who drag their feet sigh and sullenly demand mitigations are simply not fit for yoga and should occupy themselves in other areas\n this is why jesus asked which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish\n every yogi must be adhikarin qualified and woryour fit for yoga and capable of its total practice\n jesus said come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest\n take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls\n for my yoke is easy and my burden is light\n it is interesting that he likens spiritual life to the cumbersome wooden yoke of oxen or bullocks assuring us that it will be restful and easy and light to bear\n how is this to a strong ox or bullock the heaviest of yokes will be of no consequence\n so if we are the kind of people for whom yoga is intended its requirements and disciplines will be light and easeful\n but if instead of being oxen or bullocks we are dogs and swine symbols used by jesus for the unworyour the light and easy yoke will break our backs this is why some people should take up bowling or surfing and forget religion altogether what to say of yoga\n for the serious seekers yough the ancient rishis hold back nothing but give the full picture of the self\n the immortal self the self can appear please note i say appear to enter into numberless conditions and interior states\n it even experiences millions of births and deaths yet it never really dies for immortality is a fundamental trait of its nature\n it is not easy but the yogi must cultivate a continual awareness that he is immortal being never anything less and never anything more and order his life accordingly\n i do not mean by this that he denies his present seeming condition but that as yogananda continually advised he is always aware that he is only sitting in the motion picture theatre of the cosmos watching a movie that cosmic as its scope may be can be wiped away in a moment that only he and the other viewers are real that all must eventually leave the theater and go home to infinity\n how splendid are the truths of the vedanta the sun the self is the source of all light the inner light of consciousness that illumines all things\n for outside the self there is no perception of even the brightest of material suns\n it is the presence of the self that produces awareness of all phenomena\n outside the self nothing at all exists\n within the self is everything\n shining in the sky the self shines in the sky of the chidakasha the subtle ether akasha \n the chidakasha is the infinite all pervading expanse of consciousness from which all things proceed the true heart of all things\n the shining of the self in the chidakasha is the emanation of om\n in the individual the chidakasha is the subtle space of consciousness located in the sahasrara the thousand petalled lotus that is the astral causal brain\n from that point om the word of life pranava enlivens and illumines all things which is why we meditate upon om in the head\n the breeze blowing in space the self is also that power which moves within the chidakasha as the wind moves within earthly space\n as the wind causes movement in the trees and on the surfaces of earth and water in the same way it is the self that produces all movement in the cosmos in all the worlds gross and subtle\n the fire burning on the altar the self is the transmuting force of cosmic fire on the altar of the universe\n in india of the upanishadic rishis there were no temples nor were there any external religious rites other than the sandhya morning and evening salutations of the sun and the havan the fire ritual in which by the agency of consecrated fire the offerings were transformed into subtle energy forms and transferred into higher worlds\n the self then is the ultimate transmuting power which evolves both the cosmos and the personal energies of the individual spirits within it\n the entire universe is an altar in which through the power of the self all things are offerings unto and into infinite being\n the guest dwelling in the house all things even the least atom are houses for the all pervading self\n all things that exist have the self as their inmost dweller\n where there is any objecting thing there is the self\n yet since no things are permanent the self is only a momentary guest but none the less real for that\n in all men what is meaningful to us is the truth that the self is the dweller in all consciousness beings\n and since they are not things the self is not a guest but the permanent indweller as the self of the self\n the consciousness of each one of is the only temple is which spirit ever dwells in its essential being\n alyough it can be said that in a sense our bodies are temples of god that is not really true in the purest sense\n only in our consciousness is spirit to be found\n this is why the upanishads and the bhagavad gita insist that we must identify with the self alone seeing all else as mirages destined to dissolve away and cease to exist\n their message has been summed up by shankara in these words brahman is real\n the world is illusory\n the jiva is nothing but brahman\n in the gods in the upanishads gods mean not only highly evolved beings that can control the forces of nature etc\n gods are also our higher faculties of perception which illumine our awareness of both the inner and outer worlds\n here the idea is that the self is the enlivening power by which our higher faculties function\n in the ether the ether the chidakasha is the natural home of the self\n only in this inmost level of being can the self be always perceived\n in the lesser levels we usually lose the self by losing perception of it\n how can we establish ourselves in etheric awareness through the unique property of akasha sound specifically through the japa and meditation of om as patanjali has stated in the yoga sutras\n in the vedanta sutras of the sage vyasa also called the brahma sutras he tells us anavrittih shabdai by sound vibration one becomes liberated\n wherever there is truth wherever there is true knowing there the self is operative as the sun of consciousness revealing both relative and absolute truth\n for truth is its nature\n a popular sanskrit adage is truth alone conquers meaning that victory over ignorance and bondage is found only in the self the ultimate truth\n the fish that is born in water egoit ism is a prime train of human beings usually in the form of outright arrogance\n in religion this manifests in the insistence that human beings are superior to all other beings\n even in india we have the idea that even the gods pray for human birth because supposedly only human beings can be enlightened\n in christianity there is an insistence that human beings are higher than angels because they alone can be saved through christ\n in the most ignorant of religions there is the insistence that only human beings are immortal and that animals are some kind of animated machines that human beings alone are in the image of god and suchlike\n therefore the upanishad tells us the truth that even in the dullest of animals the fish the self is present that the fish is the self in manifestation as are we\n the plant that grows in the soil lest we confine the self to animal life the upanishad further tells us that plants are dwellingplaces of the self too\n the river that gushes from the mountain and lest we think that the self in only in living things the seers assure us that in inanimate things the self is living and moving\n everything is alive in spirit\n what a sublime world view the changeless reality all the things listed as abodes of the self are ever changing and their forms are evanescent soon seen to be wiyout permanent reality\n since we identify with what we see around us we continually fall into the snare of thinking that we too change and have no ultimate reality\n even if we think otherwise intellectually we keep acting in a delusive manner\n hence we must keep reminding ourselves that we are changeless and absolutely real\n the illimitable equally wonderful is the truth that we are beyond limitation that infinite are our possibilities for we are the infinite self\n the call those who embodied their realizations in the upanishads did not do so to furnish us with a bundle of beliefs to take on faith and wrangle over\n their intention was to spur us onward to attain the same vision as they possessed to be sages equal with them no longer servants but friends\n their call to us is the same as that of swami vivekananda who continually exhorted his hearers awake arise the life giving self just as children babble on aimlessly about things they do not understand so we do the same yough in a more sophisticated way especially in religion and philosophy\n so the three verses relating to the self and life are very much needed by us\n first the upanishad tells us he the adorable one seated in the heart is the power that gives breath\n unto him all the senses do homage\n adorable the word prabhavananda translates adorable is vamanam which means adorable dear and pleasing\n these epithets are traditionally used in relation to shiva the symbol of the atman and atmic consciousness\n this is important for the self is not just truth or reality a mere abstraction but when experienced as either the individual self or the supreme self produces in us a personal response literally the response of bhakti devotion and even prema love \n in contemporary india there is the idea that bhakti and prema can only be experienced toward a being that possesses form rupa or qualities guna that it is impossible to have these responses to brahman the transcendent being\n but in the upanishads and the gita we are constantly exhorted to love brahman not just some forms of brahman and the atman\n this also indicates that the ancient upanishadic sages did not believe that the absolute or the self was wiyout attributes of any kind\n rather they considered that alyough anything said would be only approximations of divine realities still human beings could conceive of god in at least a dim way\n and they absolutely could experience god and have reactions and definitions arising from their experience\n in chapter twelve krishna speaks of this in more detail and we will consider it there\n to the yogi then the self and brahman are equally adorable\n seated in the heart god and the self are seated in the heart as the upanishads and the gita continually emphasize\n there they abide permanently it is not a matter of occasional visitations\n knowing this jesus said behold the kingdom of god is within you\n this too is a matter of direct experience\n saint luke used the word idou in other words see for yourself that the kingdom of god is within you\n this is not something jesus wants us to believe and act on blindly he wants us to experience this truth for only experience produces lasting effects\n the heart is the throne of god and the throne of the divine self\n when jesus says to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he is speaking of our heart not his\n our heart and the heart of god are not the same but they are one\n power that gives breath the upanishads literally say that it is the self which produces our inhalations and exhalations\n who could live who could breathe if that blissful self dwelt not within the lotus of the heart the self is the breath of the breath\n the breaths are the real and their reality is the self\n he who breathes in with your breathing in is your self\n he who breathes out with your breathing out is your self\n from him is born the breath\n the shining immortal person who is breath is the self is brahman\n which is the one god the breath\n in the spiritual texts of india the word hridaya heart means not just the heart or core but also is said to indicate the space akasha where the inbreath and outbreath merge the ultimate heart\n this is why yoga must involve working with the inhaling and exhalation breaths in the form of subtle pranayama\n the breath is the supreme brahman\n the breath never deserts him who knowing thus meditates upon it\n having become a god he goes to the gods\n they who know the breath of the breath have realized the ancient primordial brahman\n the senses do homage in the primal texts of sanatana dharma we find references to gods devas \n in modern hinduism we find a panorama of all kinds of gods demigods and suchlike so it is supposed that the ancient tests refer to them when speaking of devas\n but a simple perusal of the context of those references reveal that the upanishadic sages meant the senses jnanendriyas not some kind of external deific intelligences\n the senses do homage in the sense that in the evolved individual they draw near to upasate and become merged in the self which is their source\n now this tells us two interesting and usually unsuspected things\n first that it is natural for the self to control the senses not to be their slave\n second it is completely natural for the senses to move inward toward the self and experience the self by uniting with it\n neither of these is our present experience\n rather we consider it normal for the self to be bound by the senses and for it to require great struggle to turn them inward and bring them to experience of the self\n evidently we have lived in a subnormal condition so long that we have come to think subnormality is normal\n we are like the drunk man who was walking along with one foot on the sidewalk and the other down in the street\n when someone stopped him and asked why he was walking that way he burst into tears and answered thank god i yought i was a cripple\n basically the self is the goal of all\n the essence the upanishad then asks what can remain when the dweller in this body leaves the outgrown shell since he is verily the immortal self the answer is quite simple nothing but the body remains for the self is as different from the body as the pearl is from the oyster and its shell\n the departure of the self produces death and decay for it is the self alone that gives and is life the sustenance of the body\n jesus himself a yogi having lived over half of his life in india said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god\n that is we live not on matter but on the very life of god because matter is only a modification of that life energy\n the upanishad which jesus would have known expresses the same idea by saying man does not live by breath alone but by him in whom is the power of breath\n it is not breath that makes us live yough breath is the basis of our body s metabolism\n this is why yogis can live wiyout the physical act of breathing\n what we cannot do wiyout and by which we do live is him who is the source of breath especially in his primeval form om the pranava the lifegiver the word of life\n through the repetition and meditation of om as recommended by patanjali we enter into communication with the lord ishwara and then into unity with him\n for in him we live and move and have our being\n the eternal brahman the eternal self brahman and the self and now o nachiketa will i tell you of the unseen the eternal brahman and of what befalls the self after death\n this is an interesting juxtaposition brahman and the self after death of the body \n the upanishad puts these together because brahman and the self are one and after death the spirit recovers the memory of its immortality its eternity\n one with brahman the self yet experiences many changes\n those changes may only be appearances but they are nonetheless real and profoundly affect the self in its evolutionary journey\n so they need to be set forth\n the ignorant of those ignorant of the self some enter into beings possessed of wombs others enter into plants according to their deeds and the growth of their intelligence\n here again we have a most interesting thing\n instead of discussing the worlds entered by the spirit after bodily death and their nature as reflections of the spirit s karma physical rebirth is immediately being spoken of\n this is because it takes a goodly degree of evolution for the subtle worlds to have meaning for the developing spirit\n the undeveloped learn neither from earthly or astral experiences\n further many of them simply go to sleep at the moment of death and awaken only at the moment of birth\n the period of time in between does not exist for them in any meaningful sense\n in his commentary on this verse shankara cites another upanishadic statement creatures are born in accordance with their knowledge\n for evolution is a matter of knowing jnana \n the spirits that are unaware of their true nature come back into two general categories into living organisms that gestate them in some form or other and plant life\n obviously very little goes on in the life of the plant as far as consciousness is concerned\n only those who are born and live a life with some degree of control over a body vehicle can develop their consciousness to any significant extent\n implicit in this verse is the principle of the transmigration of the atman from lower to higher forms of life\n we start out as atoms of hydrogen move into mineral forms then plant forms then living organisms and then into the human body from which we shall eventually evolve into forms in higher worlds\n for most of the time evolution is automatic and incredibly slow\n but at some point we become capable of directing and enhancing our evolutionary movement\n at first this is only through thinking and acting but eventually we become capable of yoga of fully taking charge of our growth in consciousness\n until this point is reached little of any importance occurs to us\n so the upanishad is starting at a basic rung of the ladder of evolution\n but since as i have said nothing of much value take place on that level the upanishad moves ahead quite a bit to the level when we are capable of dreaming to at least the intelligent animal level\n dream creation that which is awake in us even while we sleep shaping in dream the objects of our desire that indeed is pure that is brahman and that verily is called the immortal\n all the worlds have their being in that and no one can transcend it\n that is the self\n it is a fundamental assertion of india s primal wisdom that there are four states of consciousness jagrat waking swapna dreaming sushupti dreamless sleep and turiya the pure consciousness that witnesses the first three\n turiya is the state proper to the self actually is the self which is why this verse speaks of it as that which is awake in us even while we sleep\n shaping in dream the objects of our desire\n but there is more to this self than consciousness\n it is also creative power\n alyough as yogis we use the terminology of sankhya and speak of purusha and prakriti as two entities we are only speaking of two aspects or views of the one existence\n they are absolutely one\n the upanishad reveals this by telling us that the self is not only witness it is also the witnessed\n the self is desireless yet it shows us in dreams the things we desire\n why because the self is more than witness it is guide and guru\n in every way it is attempting to show us our present spiritual status\n dreams are one of the avenues for its teaching\n it is true that dreams arise from the subconscious but they do so at the impulse of the self\n unfortunately our subconscious is distorted like a badly ground lens so the original imaging of the self comes through to us distorted or partial and the message is flawed\n however the more we clarify our minds through meditation the more faithful our dreams will be to the original impulses from the self\n in time our dreams can become authentic spiritual visions at least on occasion\n alyough showing us our desires the self remains pure the actual word being white to signify that the self has no inherent colors qualities or traits for it is brahman by nature\n thus it is also immortal no matter how many deaths we may experience both through the death of the body and the little death we experience each time we sleep dreams being a kind of after death astral experience\n all worlds all levels of experience arise from the self in union with brahman\n nothing exists apart from the self\n the self is also the ultimate being\n there is no going beyond it\n because it is one with brahman even conscious union with brahman does not cancel out our awareness of the individual atman\n this is a most important principle for many are led into the delusion that they have transcended the self and entered the not self when they have merely sunk into the morass of tamasic ignorance\n they are suffering from the subtlest form of mental illness which in time will manifest as recognizable psychosis and lead to great mental and moral disintegration in many instances to attempted or successful suicide\n the indwelling self as fire yough one takes the shape of every object which it consumes so the self yough one takes the shape of every object in which it dwells\n as air yough one takes the shape of every object which it enters so the self yough one takes the shape of every object in which it dwells\n each individual self inhabits a vast number of body vehicles as it moves up the ladder of evolution to the highest\n for a detailed study of this see \n and in each one it appears to actually become that vehicle\n yet the self remains only itself one and unique\n in this way the self gathers experiences of every form of life that exists\n this is necessary for it if it is to approximate the status of brahman for brahman existing in all forms has the experience of being all those forms\n hence the microcosmic self mirrors the macrocosmic self\n the untouched self as the sun revealer of all objects to the seer is not harmed by the sinful eye nor by the impurities of the objects it gazes on so the one self dwelling in all is not touched by the evils of the world\n for he transcends all\n having spoken to us of the fact that the self somehow takes on the form of its many incarnational forms the upanishad reminds us that the self is nonetheless absolutely unmarked by that formation and undergoes no alteration or conditioning whatsoever\n even while immanent in relative existence the self remains essentially transcendent in the same relation to its incarnate form as is brahman to the universe\n the divine eye of the self illumines all things yet is affected by none\n bliss and peace he is one the lord and innermost self of all of one form he makes of himself many forms\n to him who sees the self revealed in his own heart belongs eternal bliss to none else to none else the self is ever the master however much the forms inhabited by the self may be bound\n the self is the essential principle of the existence of all those forms always remaining one and unchanged\n he alone who beholds the self in as the core of his being possesses eternal bliss\n intelligence of the intelligent eternal among the transient he yough one makes possible the desires of many\n to him who sees the self revealed in his own heart belongs eternal peace to none else to none else consciousness of the conscious the eternal link between all the temporal bodies its inhabits the self it is that which makes possible the desires of many through countless incarnations\n he alone who beholds the self in as the core of his being possesses eternal peace\n the radiant self yamaraj has presented his student with a great deal of philosophical knowledge regarding the self\n this is all valuable but nachiketa feels impelled to ask a question wiyout the answer to which all the teaching on the self means nothing\n he asks how o king shall i find that blissful self supreme ineffable who is attained by the wise does he shine by himself or does he reflect another s light it is pointless to hear about the self if we do not know how to find the self\n it is true that in metaphysical realms the majority of people are enamored of theory and discussion wiyout practical application but the wise see things differently\n nachiketa has already grasped the fundamental nature of the self\n blissful analysis shows that the basic motivation of all beings is bliss ananda or happiness sukham that all the things we strive for are only prized because their acquisition will give rise to joy\n in this perspective we see that all beings are in search of the self for it alone is of the nature of joy\n once a person grasps this fact really grasps it he can only seek for the self all else being seen as insignificant\n in the brihadaranyaka upanishad we find the following relevant exposition it is not for the sake of the husband my beloved that the husband is dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the wife my beloved that the wife is dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the children my beloved that the children are dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of wealth my beloved that wealth is dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the brahmins my beloved that the brahmins are held in reverence but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the kshatriyas my beloved that the kshatriyas are held in honor but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the higher worlds my beloved that the higher worlds are desired but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the gods my beloved that the gods are worshiped but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the creatures my beloved that the creatures are prized but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of itself my beloved that anything whatever is esteemed but for the sake of the self\n the self maitreyi is to be known\n hear about it reflect upon it meditate upon it\n by knowing the self my beloved through hearing reflection and meditation one comes to know all things\n supreme the self is supreme there is nothing that is higher or more desirable than the self there is nothing that exists beyond the self\n it is supreme because it is existence itself\n there is no reality other than the self\n we must seek the self because only the self can be attained everything else is a mirage\n ineffable the self cannot be defined or evaluated in the terms of relative existence or relative objects none of which exist outside the self\n consequently the self cannot be intellectually understood or even defined\n nevertheless the self can be known in a manner beyond any ordinary knowing for it can be experienced as both object and subject a quality unique to itself\n attained by the wise the self is attainable\n those who at present are ignorant of the self can become knowers of the self\n alyough only the knowers of the self are fully woryour of being called wise we can certainly call those who are seeking the self also wise\n all of us can be the potentially wise if we follow the path to selfknowledge as outlined in the upanishads the gita and the yoga darshan of patanjali\n a necessary question nachiketa has declared the self to be supreme yet he prudently follows that statement with a question to dispel any possibility that he may be misunderstanding yama s teaching does the self shine by itself is light its essential nature or does it reflect another s light this is a most crucial inquiry\n is the self light or is its light drawn from a source other than the self\n this is a question that penetrates to the foundations of the cosmos demanding a clear insight\n the sublime answer him the sun does not illumine nor the moon nor the stars nor the lightning nor verily fires kindled upon the earth\n he is the one light that gives light to all\n he shining everything shines\n so yama answers his woryour pupil s woryour question\n nothing of heaven or earth illumines the self or causes it to be radiant\n rather it is swayamprakash self luminous\n furthermore it is the self that illumines all beings\n he is the one light that gives light to all\n the self is the essential nature of all sentient beings that shine with consciousness\n he shining everything shines\n all glory to the blissful supreme and ineffable self all glory to the wise who strive to attain that self as well as the supremely wise who have attained it the universal tree this universe is a tree eternally existing its root aloft its branches spread below\n the pure root of the tree is brahman the immortal in whom the three worlds have their being whom none can transcend who is verily the self\n little needs to be said about this verse its meaning is quite obvious\n we can however infer a significant principle all things are rooted above in the supreme consciousness in brahman\n everything has brahman for its essential being\n from this we get the hermetic principle as above so below\n applying this principle to our own experience we can come to understand a great deal about the higher and truer nature of what is arising and subsiding in our life\n original christianity being rooted in the upanishadic teachings of jesus isha nath taught the same and that is why in the oldest text of christian hymns we find this the likeness of that which is below is that which is above\n for everything is above and below there is nothing but it is believed to be by those in whom there is no knowledge\n that is the ignorant believe that things have an independent existence an existence that can cease rather than the truth that they are not only rooted in brahman they are an imperishable extension of brahman\n for in him we live and move and have our being for we are also his offspring as saint paul pointed out\n and he is before all things and by him all things consist\n david simply sang for with you is the fountain of life in your light shall we see light\n brahman is the ultimate state and stage of being\n there is no transcending brahman for brahman is truly the self of all\n from this we see the principle only comparatively recently discovered by science that in essence all things are immortal that there is not a single atomic particle in creation that can go out of existence that the changes we think are death and birth are only rearrangements of the living energies of which all consist\n a yogic aspect though yoga is not the subject of this verse we can extract some important yogic information from it\n since we are miniature cosmoses little universes our origin is also above in the root ball of the brain the thousand petalled lotus the sahasrara\n therefore to experience that source in meditation we orient our attention toward the head and we invoke the pure root of our being in the form of om which is the same as brahman\n the fearless source the whole universe came forth from brahman and moves in brahman\n mighty and awful is he like to a thunderbolt crashing loud through the heavens\n for those who attain him death has no terror\n awful is outdated english\n awesome is much more correct\n in older forms of english awful horrible and terrible all meant awesome and were positive but at this point in time they have reversed polarity and become negative descriptions\n brahman is inexorable power as well as infinite consciousness\n his presence is like the thunderbolt whose light blinds us to all lesser lights whose creative sound is om expanding through the chidakasha the ether of consciousness in which all things exist and of which they consist\n those who unite with this brahman experience their eternal immortality and become fearless especially in the face of the mirage called death\n the divine will in fear of him fire burns the sun shines the rains fall the winds blow and death kills\n katha upanishad here too a state of ecstatic awe and wonder is meant\n in older english which prabhavananda is using fear meant to be filled with awe and respect not to be afraid\n so when we read in the older bible translations that we should fear god we are actually being told to reverence god\n in awesome reverence of brahman the creation responds to the supreme will for it is itself an extension of brahman as already said\n all that occurs is the movement of divine consciousness is response to divine will\n brahman moves brahman and creation manifests and moves onward\n brahman ceases to move brahman and creation resolves into its potential causal form and seems to cease\n at all times it is brahman reacting upon and to brahman\n even death is only a change of life\n the root of rebirth if a man fail to attain brahman before he casts off his body he must again put on a body in the world of created things\n perfect knowledge of brahman resulting from total union of our consciousness with brahman s consciousness is the only passport beyond this world or any worlds of relative existence\n knowledge is the root determinant of our rebirth or our freedom from rebirth\n this is why most religion is so useless it deals with good and bad with truth and error on the tiny level of individual human mentalities\n the infinite scope of brahmic consciousness simply does not come into its purview\n human beings waste lifetimes with such mundane religions that only program them for more and more births upon this earth\n even their ideas of the afterlife and heaven only condition them for more birth and bondage\n degenerate christianity especially with its doctrine of physical resurrection and immortality instills material consciousness in its adherents condemning them to the wheel of perpetual birth and death\n thinking they are creatures they sink into the quagmire of creation\n actually they impel themselves into the morass calling it the will of god\n as jesus said if therefore the light that is in you be darkness how great is that darkness if our truth be actually untruth its blinding and binding power is nigh well inescapable\n the realm of realization in one s own soul brahman is realized clearly as if seen in a mirror\n in the heaven of brahma also is brahman realized clearly as one distinguishes light from darkness\n in the world of the fathers he is beheld as in a dream\n in the world of angels he appears as if reflected in water\n first this verse should put the lie to the absurd claim in contemporary hinduism that enlightenment is impossible unless the individual is born on earth in a human body\n what is the truth is the fact that the highest realm of relativity the heaven of brahma brahmaloka is the only one in which the capacity for realizing brahman is inherent in the form proper to that world\n in all other worlds the incarnational form is the bar to such realization for in the minds of the inhabitants of those worlds brahman appears only as a dream or a reflection in water\n the most important fact yough is the statement that brahman can be seen and experienced in the self of each one of us no matter what world we may or may not inhabit\n we need not aspire to ascend to any other world thinking that incarnation there is necessary for our spiritual liberation\n whatever world we may be in whatever form we may find ourselves incarnate in we can realize brahman perfectly\n why because our self is one with brahman\n this is why we sometimes read in the lore of india about animals that at their death attained moksha liberation \n it is all in the knowing the jnana\n hierarchy of consciousness the senses the senses have separate origin in their several objects\n they may be active as in the waking state or they may be inactive as in sleep\n he who knows them to be distinct from the changeless self grieves no more\n if a lost person could somehow be lifted up high and see his surroundings from that perspective he could easily see his way out of his confusion\n in the same way those who are lost in the jungle of the senses can find their way by heeding the wisdom of the upanishads\n sense experience is just that the experiences of the senses themselves\n the self witnesses these experiences and thinks that it is really undergoing them and being affected by them\n this produces great fear and suffering what to say of the mountain high heaps of illusions and delusions those experiences produce not in the self but in the mind\n the self however attributes these things to itself and fears and suffers even more\n whether the senses are active or inactive the potential suffering is ever there\n if however we can realize that such perceptions are utterly separate from us from our self all fear and sorrow cease forever\n but we must realize that truth not just accept it or act as yough it is so\n in other words we must become yogis for only yogis realize the truth of the self and the error of the not self\n the hierarchy above the senses is the mind\n above the mind is the intellect\n above the intellect is the ego\n above the ego is the unmanifested seed the primal cause\n and verily beyond the unmanifested seed is brahman the all pervading spirit the unconditioned knowing whom one attains to freedom and achieves immortality\n it will be good to do some vocabulary building at this point\n by senses is meant the five organs of perception ear skin eye tongue and nose\n often the word senses really refers to the five sense perceptions\n by mind is meant the sensory mind the perceiving faculty that receives the messages of the senses\n intellect is the faculty of understanding of reason the thinking mind\n the ego is the false i egoism or self conceit\n it is also the self arrogating principle i that is projected by the mind rather than the real self\n ego is in manifestation whenever i is said or claimed by anything other than the spirit self\n the unmanifested seed the primal cause is prabhavananda s translation of two terms mahat tattwa and avyakta\n the mahat tattwa or great principle is the first evolute from prakriti\n it is the principle of cosmic intelligence buddhi \n the avyakta is the unmanifest the primal prakriti from which all things evolve\n it is necessary for us to be aware of this hierarchy for the lesser levels can be controlled from the higher levels thus saving a great deal of time and frustration\n the supreme the source beyond all these various levels that are the machinery of the individual and the cosmos is that which is the supreme the source of all\n regarding that the upanishad continues and verily beyond the unmanifested seed is brahman the all pervading spirit the unconditioned knowing whom one attains to freedom and achieves immortality\n the self and brahman being one it is the knowledge of our self that bestows upon us freedom and immortality\n to know the self but how do we know this self not merely hear about it or believe in it but truly know it by direct experience none beholds him with the eyes for he is wiyout visible form\n yet in the heart is he revealed through self control and meditation\n those who know him become immortal\n what could be simpler we enter into the heart into the chidakasha not the physical organ called the heart that is at the core of our being\n there the self is revealed to the disciplined meditator\n immortality is the result of such knowing\n the upanishad continues with a description of the process that leads to self knowledge\n when all the senses are stilled when the mind is at rest when the intellect wavers not then say the wise is reached the highest state\n this is extremely extremely important\n because of the razzamatazz of the yoga carnival that has been rioting on from the last century nearly everyone thinks that the highest state involves chills and thrills in the form of inner sensory experiences of cataclysmic proportion including opening of chakras and rising of kundalini\n notice that the upanishad says nothing like that nor does the gita or the yoga sutras\n what it does tell us is that the pure consciousness that is reality is experienced when all the senses are stilled when the mind is at rest when the intellect wavers not\n that and that alone is the highest state which in time becomes permanent and is itself liberation\n yoga obviously much that is called yoga is not yoga at all\n this is brought out by the next verse this calm of the senses and the mind has been defined as yoga\n he who attains it is freed from delusion\n in one not freed from delusion this calm is uncertain unreal it comes and goes\n the state of calm or steadiness sthiram in awareness of awareness itself is yoga\n this frees us from delusion because it makes us aware of our true nature as the self\n in those who have not attained perfection this state comes and goes\n the upanishad tells us this so we will not be foolish enough to think that experiencing it once or even a few times is enough and wrongly think we are enlightened\n people claim enlightenment on the basis of much less\n we must practice diligently to become permanently established in it\n alyough i have told about lahiri mahashaya s teaching on the subject of this state which he called sthirattwa in the gita commentary i would like to repeat it here\n yogiraj shyama charan lahiri mahasaya continually expounded the idea that the goal of yoga is to be established in sthirattwa in perfect tranquility\n a group of spiritual leaders from calcutta once conspired against lahiri mahasay\n they invited him to join in an evening discussion on spiritual matters\n lahiri mahasay accepted the invitation and accordingly attended the meeting\n the conspirators had well prepared themselves to trap lahiri mahasay\n for example if lahiri mahasay were to express his preference for a particular deity or istadev desired lord then a particular leader would find exception to that choice\n in fact each member of the group selected a particular devata deity such as lord vishnu lord krishna lord siva the goddess kali the divine mother and prepared to debate and challenge lahiri mahasay s choice\n as soon as lahiri mahasay arrived he was received in the traditional manner and shown proper courtesy\n after a while one of the members of the group asked lahiri mahasay upon which deity do you meditate lahiri mahasay looked at him but did not reply\n then another gentleman asked him who is your istadev desired deity lahiri mahasay turned his head towards him and looked at him in the same way while keeping his peace\n finally a third gentleman asked him can you tell us upon which deity usually you meditate lahiri mahasay faced him and said very gently i meditate on sthirattva tranquility \n the gentleman replied that he did not understand what was meant by this\n lahiri mahasay continued to observe silence\n after some time another gentleman asked him could you please explain this i do not understand exactly what you are saying\n lahiri mahasay as before continued to maintain silence\n another gentleman asked can you enlighten me as to what you mean by that i do not understand at all lahiri baba told him you will not be able to understand and also i will not be able to make you understand realize through words\n the group was at a loss\n all of their preparation and conniving had come to naught\n after a long time lahiri mahasay got up and silently prepared to leave the meeting\n all showed him the traditional courtesy as he left\n as paramhansa yogananda who made lahiri mahashaya known in the west often said he who knows knows none else knows\n how can brahman be known brahman words cannot reveal mind cannot reach eyes cannot see\n how then save through those who know him can he be known brahman can only be truly known by direct experience in meditation\n this verse is not speaking of that ultimate knowing but of the knowing about brahman so we can be stimulated to seek brahman\n empty words and intellectual ponderings cannot bring about this knowing nor can our mind and senses\n but those who know of brahman even imperfectly possess a spiritual power in their presence and in their words which convey an intuitive glimmer of the reality of brahman\n that glimmer entering into our hearts through contact with them causes our inmost awareness to awaken arise and respond and seek the full realization of brahman for ourselves\n this is why the company of sadhakas is essential for the questing soul\n it is like one candle lighting another\n the two selves there are two selves the apparent self and the real self\n of these it is the real self and he alone who must be felt as truly existing\n to the man who has felt him as truly existing he reveals his innermost nature\n it is common in western metaphysical yought to speak of the lower self that is not truly the self but the lesser aspects of human existence and the higher self that is the real self\n we must distinguish between the two and this impossible wiyout enough inner development making possible the intuition of the self even if it is not directly known\n one who has this intuition if intelligent will then begin to seek to know the self to become a yogi in some manner\n to such a one who perseveres the self will be revealed in its fulness\n as swami gambhirananda renders the first part of this verse the self is to be realized as existing and then as it really is\n this realization is what is meant by distinguishing between the unreal and the real\n from mortality to immortality lead me from death to immortality is part of a prayer at the beginning of the brihadaranyaka upanishad\n in this final part of the katha upanishad we are given practical understanding of the way in which immortality is gained\n the mortal in whose heart desire is dead becomes immortal\n the mortal in whose heart the knots of ignorance are untied becomes immortal\n these are the highest truths taught in the scriptures\n when desire dies when ignorance drops away immortality is revealed\n practically speaking we become immortal but in reality we have always been immortal\n yet like a millionaire who thinks he is a pauper our immortality is of little meaning to us until we come to realize and experience it\n furthermore the upanishad tells us that in essence this truth is the only spiritual teaching there is not just the highest truths as prabhavananda renders it shankara says that this is the only teaching in all the upanishads however varying the approaches may be\n the aspirant must not lose himself in philosophical byways including those set forth in mountains of books on yoga and vedanta\n he must keep his vision clear and focused by understanding that liberation is the only point the upanishads ever make\n attaining immortality it is easy to tell ourselves to rid ourselves of desire and ignorance but how is that to be done especially since we have been in the grip of these two ogres for creation cycles the upanishad gives us the yogic key to rising above desire and ignorance into immortality radiating from the lotus of the heart there are a hundred and one nerves\n one of these ascends toward the yousand petaled lotus in the brain\n if when a man comes to die his vital force passes upward and out through this nerve he attains immortality but if his vital force passes out through another nerve he goes to one or another plane of mortal existence and remains subject to birth and death\n it is noteworyour that this comes at the very end of the upanishad\n yogananda used to say yoga is the beginning of the end\n so it is appropriate that after all the philosophical exposition the yoga teaching should be given\n by heart is meant the hub located in the midst of the upper trunk of the body of subtle passages known as nadis here translated nerves through which the life force prana circulates throughout the gross and subtle bodies just as the blood circulates from the heart through the veins of the physical body\n one hundred of these nadis direct the life force to the life processes of the bodies and are the forces of embodiment\n one unique nadi however rises directly upward from the heart hub into the head\n this nadi rises from the heart directly into the head it is not the passage in the midst of the spine\n if at the time of death the departing spirit leaves through that channel he gains immortality\n but if his consciousness attaches itself to any of the hundred other nadis he will be impelled into the subtle worlds that lead inexorably back to incarnation in relativity\n in every meditation by intoning om in time with the breath we activate this channel causing the life force to spontaneously and effortlessly flow upward into the yousand petalled lotus in the head toward the divine radiance that shines above and upon the upper levels of the brain lotus\n that divine light is the essence of om the life giving word the pranava\n then at the end of life having prepared himself by this practice sitting in meditation the yogi ascends upward from the body into the realm of immortality\n the supreme person who is liberated in this manner in conclusion to his teaching yama tells nachiketa the supreme person of the size of a thumb the innermost self dwells forever in the heart of all beings\n as one draws the pith from a reed so must the aspirant after truth with great perseverance separate the self from the body\n know the self to be pure and immortal yea pure and immortal if the self is seen immaterial as it is it will appear as an oval light in the shape of a human thumb\n the shape is also that of a shiva linga which is a symbol of the self\n those who have seen this are unanimous in describing it in the manner of the upanishad\n in my early teens i met a christian minister who described the death of his twin brother\n he said that at the moment of death his brother s mouth opened and as he exhaled for the final time a white light shaped like a thumb emerged from his mouth and passed from the room\n it is through meditation as i have described it that we daily work on the separation of the self from the body which will finally occur at the time of death\n not that we leave our body in meditation but we begin conditioning all our bodies so they will not hold on to us at the final moments\n as the fully ripened kernel of a nut pulls away from the shell so that when it is cracked the kernel comes out in full separation so will it be with our self in relation to the body\n sri ramakrishna described it as being like the release of a fish back into the river\n may these final words of yama echo within us know the self to be pure and immortal yea pure and immortal nachiketa and us now the upanishadic sage gives us a final assurance nachiketa having learned from the god this knowledge and the whole process of yoga was freed from impurities and from death and was united with brahman\n thus will it be with another also if he know the innermost self",
    "Prasna": "om o gods may we hear auspicious words with the ears while engaged in sacrifices may we see auspicious things with the eyes while praising the gods with steady limbs may we enjoy a life that is beneficial to the gods\n may indra of ancient fame be auspicious to us may the supremely rich or all knowing pusa god of the earth be propitious to us may garuda the destroyer of evil be well disposed towards us may brihaspati ensure our welfare\n om peace peace peace sukesa son of bharadvaja satyakama so of sibi the grandson of surya born of the family of garga kausalya so of asvala a scion of the line of bhrigu born in vidarbha and kabandhi descendant of katya all these who were devoted to the inferior brahman engaged in realising the inferior brahman and intent on a search of the supreme brahman approached with faggots in hand the venerable pippalada with the belief this one will certainly tell us all about it\n to them the seer said live here again for a year in a fitting manner with control over the senses and with brahmaacharya and faith\n then put questions as you please\n if we know we shall explain all your questions\n after that kabandhi descendant of katya having approached him asked venerable sir from what indeed are all these beings born to him he said the lord of all creatures became desirous of progeny\n he deliberated on past vedic knowledge\n having brooded on that knowledge he created a couple food and prana under the idea these two will produce creatures for me in multifarious ways\n the sun is verily prana and food is verily the moon\n whatever is gross or subtle is but food\n the gross as distinguished from that subtle is certainly food of the subtle \n now then the fact that the sun while rising enters into the eastern direction thereby it absorbs into its rays all the creatures in the east\n that it enters into the south that it enters into the west that it enters into the north that it reaches the nadir and the zenith that it enters the intermediate points of the zodiac that it illumines all thereby it absorbs all living things into its rays\n that very one rises up who is prana and fire who is identified with all creatures and who is possessed of all forms\n this very one that has been referred to is spoken of by the mantra the realisers of brahman knew the one that is possessed of all forms full of rays endowed with illumination the resort of all the single light of all and the radiator of heat\n it is the sun that rises the sun that possesses a yousand rays exists in a hundred forms and is the life of all creatures\n the year is verily the lord of creatures\n of him there are two courses the southern and the northern\n as to that those who follow in that way the sacrifices and public good etc\n that are products of action conquer the very world of the moon\n it is they who come back\n since this is so hence these seers of heaven who are desirous of progeny attain the southern course\n that which is the course of the manes is verily food\n again by searching for the self through the control of the senses brahmaacharya faith and meditation they conquer the sun by proceeding along the northern course\n this is the resort of all that lives this is indestructible this is fearless this is the highest goal for from this they do not come back\n this is unrealisable to the ignorant \n pertaining to this here is a verse some talk of this sun as possessed of five feet as the father as constituted by twelve limbs and as full of water in the high place above the sky\n but there are these others who call him the omniscient and say that on him as possessed of seven wheels and six spokes is fixed the whole universe \n the month verily is the lord of all creatures\n the dark fortnight is his food and the bright his prana\n therefore these seers perform the sacrifices in the bright fortnight\n the others perform it in the other\n day and night are verily the lord of all creatures\n day is surely his prana and night is certainly the food\n those who indulge in passion in the day waste away prana\n that they give play to passion at night is as good as celibacy\n food is nothing but the lord of all creatures\n from that indeed issues that human seed\n from that are born all these beings\n this being so those who undertake the well known vow of the lord of all creatures beget both sons and daughters\n for them alone is this world of the moon in whom there are the vows and continence and in whom is found for ever avoidance of falsehood\n for them is that taintless world of brahman in whom there is no crookedness no falsehood and no dissimulation\n next a scion of the line of bhrigu born in vidarbha asked him sir how many in fact are the deities that sustain a creature which among them exhibit this glory which again is the chief among them to him he said space in fact is this deity as also are air fire water earth the organ of speech mind eye and ear\n exhibiting their glory they say unquestionably it is we who hold together this body by not allowing it to disintegrate\n to them the chief prana said do not be deluded\n it is i who do not allow it to disintegrate by sustaining it by dividing myself fivefold\n he appeared to be rising up from the body out of indignation\n as he ascended all the others too ascended immediately and when he remained quite all others too remained in position\n just as in the world all the bee take to flight in accordance as the king of the bees takes to his wings and they settle down as he does so similarly did speech mind eye ear etc\n becoming delighted they began to praise prana\n this one i\n prana burns as fire this one is the sun this one is cloud this one is indra and air this one is the earth and food\n this god is the gross and the subtle as well as that which is nectar\n like spokes on the hub of a chariot wheel are fixed on prana all things riks yajus samas sacrifice kshatriya and brahmana\n it is you who move about in the womb as the lord of creation and it is you who take birth after the image of the parents\n o prana it is for you who reside with the organs that all these creatures carry presents\n you are the best transmitter of libation to the celestials\n you are the food offering to the manes that precedes other offerings\n you are the right conduct of the organs that constitute the essence of the body and are known as the atharvas\n o prana you are indra\n through your valour you are rudra and you are the preserver on all sides\n you move in the sky you are the sun the lord of all luminaries\n o prana when you pour down as rain then these creatures of yours continue to be in a happy mood under the belief food will be produced to our hearts content\n o prana you are unpurified you are the fire ekarsi you are the eater and you are the lord of all that exists\n we are the givers of your food\n o matarisva you are our father\n make calm that aspect of yours that is lodged in speech that which is in the ear that which is in the eye and that which permeates the mind\n do not rise up\n all this in this world as also all that is in heaven is under the control of prana\n protect us just as a mother does her sons and ordain for us splendour and intelligence\n then kausalya son of asvala asked him o venerable sir from where is this prana born how does he come into this body how again does he dwell by dividing himself how does he depart how does he support the external things and how the physical to him he said you are putting super normal questions since you are pre eminently a knower of brahman\n hence i speak to you\n from the self is born this prana\n just as there can be shadow when a man is there so this prana is fixed on the self\n he comes to this body owing to the actions of the mind\n as it is the king alone who employs the officers saying rule over these villages and those ones just so prana engages the other organs separately\n he places apana in the two lower apertures\n prana himself issuing out of the mouth and nostrils resides in the eyes and ears\n in the middle however is samana for this one distributes equally all this food that is eaten\n from that issue out these seven flames\n this self i\n the subtle body is surely in the heart\n there are a hundred and one of the chief nerves\n each of them has a hundred division \n each branch is divided into seventy two yousand subbranches\n among them moves vyana\n now then udana when it is in its upward trend leads to a virtuous world as a result of virtue to a sinful world as a result of sin and to the human world as a result of both\n the sun is indeed the external prana\n it rises up favouring this prana in the eye\n that deity that is in the earth favours by attracting apana in a human being\n the space i\n air that is within is samana\n the common air is vyana\n that which if well known as luminosity is udana\n therefore one who gets his light extinguished attains rebirth together with the organs that enter into his mind\n together with whatever yought he had at the time of death he enters into prana\n prana in combination with udana and in association with the soul leads him to the world desired by him\n the line of progeny of any man of knowledge who knows prana thus sustains no break\n pertaining to this there occurs this mantra\n having known the origin coming lodgement and fivefold overlordship and the physical existence of prana one achieves immortality\n having known one achieves immortality\n then the grandson of surya born of the family of garga asked him o adorable sir which are the organs that go to sleep in this person which keep awake in him which is the deity who experiences dream to whom occurs this happiness in whom do all get merged to him he said o gargya just as all the rays of the setting sun become unified in this orb of light and they disperse from the sun as it rises up again similarly all that becomes unified in the high deity the mind\n hence this person does not then hear does not see does not smell does not taste does not touch does not speak does not grasp does not enjoy does not eject does not move\n people say he is sleeping\n it is the fires i\n the functions resembling fire of prana that really keep awake in this city of the body\n that which is this apana really resembles the garhapatya fire vyana resembles the fire anvaharyapacana\n since the ahavaniya fire is obtained from garhapatya which is the former s source of extraction therefore prana conforms to ahavaniya because of its issuing out of apana \n samana is the priest called hota because it strikes a balance between exhalation and inhalation which are but comparable to two oblations\n the mind is verily the sacrificer\n the desired fruit udana which leads this sacrificer every day to brahman\n in this dream state this deity i\n the mind experiences greatness\n whatever was seen it sees again whatever was heard it hears again whatever was perceived in the different places and directions it experiences again and again it perceives all by becoming all that was seen or not seen heard or not heard perceived or not perceived and whatever is real or unreal\n when that deity the mind becomes overwhelmed by solar rays called bile then in this state the deity does not see dreams\n then all that time there occurs this kind of happiness in this body\n to illustrate the point as the birds o good looking one proceed towards the tree that provides lodging just so all these proceed to the supreme self\n earth and the rudiment of earth water and the rudiment of water fire and the rudiment of fire space and the rudiment of space the organ and object of vision the organ and object of hearing the organ and object of smell the organ and object of taste the organ and object of touch the organ and content of speech the hands and the object grasped sex and enjoyment the organ of excretion and the excreta the feet and the space trodden the mind and the content of yought understanding and the content of understanding egoism and the content of egoism awareness and the content of awareness the shining skin and the object revealed by that prana and all that has to be held by prana\n and this one is the seer feeler hearer smeller taster thinker ascertainer doer the purusha pervading the body and senses that is a knower by nature\n this becomes wholly established in the supreme immutable self\n he who realises that shadowless bodiless colourless pure immutable attains the supreme immutable itself\n o amiable one he again who realises becomes omniscient and all\n illustrative of this there occurs this verse o amiable one he becomes all knowing and enters into all who knows that immutable wherein merges the cognising self the purusha who is naturally a knower as also do the organs and the elements together with all the deities\n next satyakama son of sibi asked him o venerable sir which world does he really win thereby who among men intently meditates on om in that wonderful way till death to him he said o satyakama this very brahman that is known as the inferior and superior is but this om\n therefore the illumined soul attains either of the two through this one means alone\n should he meditate on om as consisting of one letter he becomes enlightened even by that and attains a human birth on the earth\n the rik mantras lead him to the human birth\n being endued there with self control continence and faith he experiences greatness\n now gain if he meditates on om with the help of the second letter he becomes identified with the mind\n by the yajur mantras he is lifted to the intermediate space the world of the moon\n having experienced greatness in the lunar world he turns round again\n again any one who meditates on the supreme purusha with the help of this very syllable om as possessed of three letters becomes unified in the sun consisting of light\n as a snake becomes freed from its slough exactly in a similar way he becomes freed from sin and he is lifted up to the world of brahma hiranyagarbha by the sama mantras\n from this total mass of creatures that hiranyagarbha is he sees the supreme purusha that penetrates every being and is higher than the higher one viz\n bearing on this there occur two verses the three letters by themselves are within the range of death\n but if they are closely joined one to another are not divergently applied to different objects and are applied to the three courses of action external internal and intermediate that are properly resorted to then the man of enlightenment does not shake i\n the intelligent know this world that is attainable by the rik mantras the intermediate space achievable by the yajur mantras and that which is reached by the sama mantras\n the enlightened man attains that threefold world through om alone and through om as an aid he reaches that also which is the supreme reality that is quiet and beyond old age death and fear\n then sukesa son of bharadvaja asked him venerable sir hiranyanabha a prince of kosala approached me and put this question bharadvaja do you know the purusha possessed of sixteen limbs to that prince i said i do not know him\n had i known him why should i not have told you anyone who utters a falsehood dries up root and all\n therefore i cannot afford to utter a falsehood\n silently he went away riding on the chariot\n of that purusha i ask you where does he exist to him he pippalada said o amiable one here itself inside the body is that purusha in whom originate these sixteen digits or limbs \n he deliberated as a result of whose departure shall i rise up and as a result of whose continuance shall i remain established he created prana from prana he created faith space air fire water earth organs mind food from food he created vigour self control mantras rites worlds and name in the worlds\n the illustration is this just as these flowing rivers that have the sea as their goal get absorbed after reaching the sea and their names and forms are destroyed and they are called merely the sea so also these sixteen parts i\n constituents of the all seeing purusha that have purusha as their goal disappear on reaching purusha when their names and forms are destroyed and they are simply called purusha\n such a man of realisation becomes free from the parts and is immortal\n on this point there occurs this verse you should know that purusha who is woryour to be known and in whom are transfixed the parts like spokes in the nave of a chariot wheel so that death may not afflict you anywhere\n to them he said i know this supreme brahman thus far only\n beyond this there is nothing\n while worshipping him they said you indeed are our father who have ferried us across nescience to the other shore\n salutation to the great seers\n salutation to the great seers\n om o gods may we hear auspicious words with the ears while engaged in sacrifices may we see auspicious things with the eyes while praising the gods with steady limbs may we enjoy a life that is beneficial to the gods\n may indra of ancient fame be auspicious to us may the supremely rich or all knowing pusa god of the earth be propitious to us may garuda the destroyer of evil be well disposed towards us may brihaspati ensure our welfare\n om peace peace peace here ends the prasnopanishad included in the atharva veda\n commentary on the prashna upanishad by swami nirmalananda giri the right beginning this upanishad the prashna upanishad is called the question prashna upanishad because of its format of question and answer throughout\n but the first two verses set the stage for the reader and also indicate what is needed for a successful quest after the knowledge of brahman at least that which can be taught and comprehended intellectually\n the seekers sukesha satyakama gargya kousalya bhargava and kabandhi devotees and seekers after the truth of the supreme brahman with faith and humility approached the sage pippalada\n because it would have no meaning for western readers swami prabhavananda has omitted the parentage and family ties of these six seekers\n nevertheless their listing is significant for a yogi must have psychological ancestors in the form of inner spiritual qualities that will help him to persevere in yoga practice\n besides a good inner background the upanishad cites four good traits needed by every aspirant to higher evolution devotion in the sense of dedication desire to know god faith and humility\n dedication is needful for it keeps us steady when we encounter snags and obstacles in our path and it keeps us plodding along in times of dryness and uncertainty\n it ensures that we will persevere in our efforts to attain spiritual heights\n it is easy to forget why we originally took up spiritual life and wander into byways of lesser endeavor\n this is why many become tangled up in externalities of religion wrangling over philosophical concepts and even becoming enamored of control over others under the pretence of religious discipline\n as jesus told martha thou art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful \n because of this the upanishad tells us that these wise seekers were intent on a single thing the truth of the supreme brahman\n we should aspire to and settle for nothing less\n faith in the form of conviction of the reality of spiritual matters is also a necessity for who can persevere in search of something about which they have no inner assurance we need the convictionfaith that god is real and can be known\n saint paul encapsulated the whole matter when he wrote he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him\n an interior knowing that god is real and can be experienced will give us the strength we need to keep on to the goal\n humility in the sense of a willingness to listen and learn aware of all we do not know is essential\n respect is also implied here\n in the east they overdo it to the point of groveling and mindless acceptance while in the west the casual one on one attitude is exaggerated into overfamiliarity and virtual disrespect\n it is amazing how very wise western ignoramuses consider themselves\n as someone once wrote the trouble with ignorance is that it gains confidence as it goes along\n the seeker must be keenly aware that he lacks something a great deal in fact with emphasis on need\n he must not forget that seeking implies needing and asking\n those who strut up to a teacher as yough they are visiting the zoo will and should receive nothing\n on the other hand the seeker should not grovel or be unthinkingly accepting\n the student should carefully examine the prospective teacher to see if he is qualified and worth listening to\n the woryour teacher will equally carefully examine the prospective student to see if he has the right attitude and is capable of learning and applying what is learned\n a dud on either end ruins the equation\n the requisites said the sage practice austerity continence faith for a year then ask what questions you wish\n if i can i will answer\n now this is the way of a real teacher of brahmajnana\n he tells what they must do and what he will then do\n there is a story told in india of a young man who came to a guru and asked to learn from him\n the guru told him what he would have to do to qualify himself\n not very happy with the list he asked what the guru would do in all that time\n when told that the guru would teach him occasionally as he would deem appropriate the would be disciple remarked why don t you make me a guru instead that sounds a lot easier\n many approach a teacher while living in a fantasy world projected by their over confident ego\n if the teacher is as false as they and conforms to the fantasy they are happy\n but if the teacher is real and dares to speak to them realistically about the means and the goal they are most displeased\n we are not of this type hopefully so let us look at the requirements pippalada sets forth\n spiritual discipline tapasya most particularly the practice of meditation\n control of the senses brahmaacharya especially continence\n faith in the teaching of the upanishadic sages regarding the supreme goal the possibility of attaining it and their assertions as to the means of attainment\n these are absolute necessities and they must be unwaveringly practiced and held to for a significant length of time before the seeker can possibly be mentally and spiritually capable of comprehending the wisdom of the sages\n first the students must be qualified otherwise a qualified teacher will be of no use to them at all\n the teacher then ask what questions you wish\n if i can i will answer\n this promise contains two major qualities of an authentic spiritual teacher\n first the teacher will accept and consider whatever the student asks\n he will not shrug off even the silliest inquiry nor will he reject the student s questioning of the veracity or value of what he believes or teaches\n this is one of the most glorious characteristics of sanatana dharma it has no fear of honest inquiry and honest doubt\n not being insecure the teacher of dharma is not disturbed by questioning or statements of disbelief\n a friend of mine told me that she quit being a christian when as a teenager she dared to express doubts to her parish priest\n he raved at her and threatened hell saying that to even ask for explanation of the mysteries was a sin and an insult to god\n so she walked away and never went back\n over sixty years later she came into the orbit of sanatana dharma asked all her questions and received answers that restored her faith in jesus but not in churchianity\n in true dharma we find the key to understanding the teachings of all the masters of all the ages\n i have found throughout nearly fifty years that sanatana dharma illumines their words to a degree that their professed followers and isms cannot even dream of\n those who would follow jesus and buddha need to seek out the same source from which they drew their teachings sanatana dharma\n then like them they can become sanatana dharmis and thereby become their true disciples\n sanatana dharma expands their horizons to embrace all truth wherever it may be found\n it is true that of late there have arisen bigots in india who speak as hatefully and ignorantly about other religions as those religions speak of others\n but they are not sanatana dharmis for the dharma has no place for hate ignorance and sectarianism\n as jesus said the truth sets you free\n second a woryour teacher will acknowledge that he cannot answer some questions\n this is because some things are simply beyond verbal expression\n further no true teacher is egoit istical therefore he will readily admit it if he feels it is beyond his capacity to explain something just as we find that sometimes we cannot find a word to express what we know well inwardly\n and most of all a good teacher is willing to admit when he just does not know the answer to something\n only a fool thinks he is omniscient and only a fake wants others to think he is\n in my encounters with teachers the person nearest to being all knowing was swami sivananda and he was known to reply i really don t know to certain questions\n but he certainly knew the way to god as the lives of his disciples attest\n sometimes a master does not know the answer to a question because it is trivial and foolish and his mind is free from triviality and foolishness\n so we have seen the two elements needed for a meaningful exchange of questions and answers woryour questioners and woryour answerers\n the father and mother of all by swami nirmalananda giri after a year kabandhi approached the teacher and asked sir how did the creatures come into being this is the question of any reflective person\n there are many answers to it but this upanishad goes to the root of relative existence as pippalada replies the lord of beings replied the sage meditated and produced prana the primal energy and rayi the giver of form desiring that they male and female should in manifold ways produce creatures for him\n prajapati brahma the lord of creation did not create the world in the manner understood in the west rather he manifested it from the primal energy known as prakriti by the power of his meditation\n this was no new occurrence for the projection and withdrawal of the cosmos in precise cycles has been going on from eternity\n just as wind moving over water causes it to take on a multitude of waveforms so does the creative yought of brahma\n in genesis we are told in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth\n and darkness was upon the face of the deep\n and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters\n the breath ruach of god the creative yought of god moved on the causal waters and the cosmos began to manifest\n creation begins and moves on in an exact order so the first thing that occurred was the manifestation of prana and rayi internal life and the outer energy that manifests as form\n there are many levels of manifestation and pippalada is only speaking of the lower worlds which are manifested by brahma\n the lower worlds mirror the higher ones and in christian terminology this coming forth of prana and rayi are equivalent to the coming forth of the son and the holy spirit from the transcendent absolute the father at the very highest level of manifestation\n prana and rayi are the two poles of manifesting energy positive and negative male and female\n this duality is at the heart of all that presently exists and wiyout it everything dissolves\n prana and rayi are the parents of all things\n creation is their perpetual interaction\n as yogananda wrote in one of his chants spirit and nature dancing together all creatures all that exist in relativity have sprung from prana and rayi\n this is why all religions have intuited the existence of a primeval father and mother of all\n sun and moon even more nearly all religions have had some idea about the original father and mother being the sun and moon respectively\n prana the primal energy is the sun and rayi the form giving substance is the moon\n be it known that all this universe that which is gross and that which is subtle is one with rayi\n therefore is rayi omnipresent\n in like manner is the universe one with prana\n nothing can exist wiyout duality prana and rayi at the root of their manifestation and they are still being maintained by them\n in india they knew from the beginning that the sun and moon were essential even for plant life\n in the west also people have known for hundreds if not yousands of years that alyough the light and heat of the sun causes the germination of seeds it is the moon that guides their growth and wise gardeners plant according to the lunar cycles\n we even have the term planting moon\n even more all things are the embodiment of prana and rayi\n the universe is prana and rayi\n spirit paramatman and atman alone is independent of these two and untouched by them\n the rising sun pervades the east and fills with energy all beings that there inhabit and likewise when his rays fall on the south the west the north the zenith the nadir and the intermediate regions to all beings that there inhabit he gives life\n just as the one sun can be reflected in numberless ways so prana enlivens all things and moves within them\n the life in even an atom is cosmic life\n prana is the soul of the universe assuming all forms he is the light that animates and illumines all even as it is written the wise know him who assumes all forms who is radiant who is all knowing who is the one light that gives light to all\n he rises as the sun of a yousand rays and abides in infinite places\n prana is parabrahmaan itself not only is brahman prana the soul of the universe brahman is also the forms assumed he shining everything shines\n every single sentient being is a ray of that divine sun who abides in all their inmost essence\n the two paths prana and rayi uniting divide the year\n two are the paths of the sun two are the paths that men travel after death\n these are the southern and the northern\n those who desire offspring and are devoted to almsgiving and rituals considering these the highest accomplishment attain the world of the moon and are born again on earth\n they travel by the southern path which is the path of the fathers and is indeed rayi the maker of forms\n there are two paths that can be taken after death the path that leads to expanding life in higher realms of existence and the path that leads back to the world of material embodiment the paths of prana and rayi\n the year spoken here is not the earthly measure of time based on the movement of the earth around the sun alyough it is believed to be so in the degeneracy of contemporary hinduism\n rather it is the cyclic manifestation of prana within the subtle mental bodies of each one of us\n the southern path is the part of the cycle in which the prana becomes more embedded or grounded in the consciousness of form the body\n on the other hand the northern path is the part of the cycle in which the prana becomes increasingly active in the spiritual levels of our being causing the consciousness to rise to higher degrees\n the supposed south and north movement of the sun has nothing whatsoever to do with this even yough it is commonly yought so at this time\n the moon is a symbol of the material creation which is but a reflection of higher regions of consciousness just as the moon has no light of its own but only reflects the light of the sun\n the path of rebirth those who desire offspring and are devoted to almsgiving and rituals considering these the highest accomplishment attain the world of the moon and are born again on earth\n they travel by the southern path which is the path of the fathers and is indeed rayi the maker of forms\n this is quite clear those who are addicted to family life and external religion are impelled by their own earthly desires to be reborn on earth\n for such desires are rooted in earthly experience and perpetuate it\n the path of liberation but those who are devoted to the worship of the self by means of austerity continence faith and knowledge go by the northern path and attain the world of the sun\n the sun the light is indeed the source of all energy\n it is immortal beyond fear it is the supreme goal\n for him who goes to the sun there is no more birth nor death\n the sun ends birth and death\n later in the fifth section of this upanishad it will be explained that by meditation on om a yogi will be united with the solar light and ascend to the realization of brahman\n but right now the necessary adjuncts to such a meditation are enumerated austerity tapasya continence brahmaacharya faith shraddha and knowledge vidya \n those who prepare themselves by these practices in conjunction with meditation on om will ascend to the solar world and freed from the compulsion to rebirth will pass onward to the transcendental realm of brahman\n in the mechanism of the universe there are many wheels within wheels as in clockwork\n so the upanishad then speaks of the month as reflection of prana and rayi just like the year prana and rayi uniting form the month\n its dark fortnight is rayi and its bright fortnight is prana\n sages perform their devotional rites in the light with knowledge fools in the dark with ignorance\n here too the material lunar phases are not being spoken of but rather the inner cycles of spiritual awareness and spiritual ignorance\n the wise do not act blindly even in spiritual practice but with understanding of how and why they should engage in meditation and worship\n because they lack the requisite insight the ignorant engage in superstition even if externally they seem to be doing the same as the wise\n wiyout inner awakening all is hopeless and awakening is a matter of evolution\n it cannot come from an external source\n this is why ordinary propagandizing religion plunges people deeper into ignorance and folly\n until the inner consciousness begins to manifest only error can be the fruition of any religion\n this is why sanatana dharma never engages in any form of missionary persuasion or coercion\n adherents of the eternal religion know that until a person ripens spiritually even sanatana dharma is meaningless and pointless inevitably confusing and potentially harmful\n that this is true is being proven every moment in the west by those who are deforming dharma into an ego driven diversion and often a tool for the same negative domination and opportunism that has made western religion and philosophy into the absurd and destructive force it has been for centuries\n and the advaitins are the worst\n food now a very interesting symbol is introduced food is prana and rayi\n from food is produced seed and from seed in turn are born all creatures\n nikhilananda translates this verse food verily is prajapati the creator \n from that comes semen retas from semen are all these creatures born\n the idea here is that prana and form the two aspects of prajapati are manifesting as food not just food that is eaten and digested but rather all things that enter the sentient being s life and mind and shape him\n the body is formed of nothing but food and the same is true of the four subtler bodies as well\n the mind and the senses eat also\n so we can realize that god is not only the source of all but the manifester sustainer and evolver of all\n there is nothing around us that is not divine manifestation\n this is the vision the yogi strives for\n at the end of his many births the wise man takes refuge in me\n he knows all is vasudeva\n how very rare is that great soul sri ramakrishna once said the divine mother showed me that there are not two but one existence only\n it is satchidananda alone that has taken many forms\n it is he alone who has become the living beings the universe and everything\n it is he who has become food\n what the rishis perceived so many yousands of years ago can be known even today by the fervent yogi\n home truths now it is time to get down to the solid facts to the only sensible conclusions that can be drawn if we accept all the upanishad has been saying to us those who worship the world of creation produce children but those alone attain the world of brahman who are steadfast in continence meditation and truthfulness\n guilty insecure people are always demanding assurance and approval from others\n they usually get it from those equally guilty or equally foolish and evade facing the truth about themselves\n in the long run such avoidance does absolutely no good but being people who live in the moment they are sait isfied with the deception\n this especially manifests in those who worship the world of creation and materiality by their insisting on being assured that ascetic life is not necessary or superior to their maya mired mode of existence\n they bullyingly demand this assurance from supposed spiritual teachers and especially monastics employing a variety of ways to get what they want\n but the upanishadic sages are long departed from this world and their words have been preserved for yousands of years\n what they say can be ignored but it cannot be denied\n world worshippers become gears in society and immerse themselves in material involvement with the world s goods living as they please in egocentric self pleasing modes of life\n they may not engender actual children now they have learned to frustrate the natural consequences of sex but the resulting consciousness will be the same\n living as they please they are bound by the hopes and joys of earthly life creating for themselves a guaranteed return to the realm of death that is this world\n sri ramakrishna used to say there is no substance at all in worldly life\n and there is no substance in those that expend themselves in and on the world\n the rare few who have seen through the sham of the world and understood the reality of the self live in a very different manner\n if their karma is very good they take up the ascetic life early on otherwise they wake up somewhere along their path in life turn from the common folly and become disciplined and purified in their mode of life\n whichever it may be the life of all the wise is centered in continence meditation and truthfulness\n there is no need for a comment on that or on the final statement the pure world of brahman is attainable by those only who are neither deceitful nor wicked nor false\n the powers that make us be each of us is both who and what\n the who is simple to define individualized consciousness or jivatman individualized self\n the what on the other hands is quite complex which is why we have gotten lost in it and confused for lifetimes beyond number\n the first step in learning how to undo this dilemma is learning what is keeping it going\n for that reason then bhargava approached the teacher and asked holy sir how many several powers hold together this body which of them are most manifest in it and which is the greatest prashna upanishad we need to know who our jailers are and especially who the governor of the jail may be\n so our makeup the powers replied the sage are ether air fire water earth these being the five elements which compose the body and besides these speech mind eye ear and the rest of the sense organs\n once these powers made the boastful assertion we hold the body together and support it prashna upanishad the five elements panchabhuta are forms of cosmic energy which make up the various bodies of the human being including the five senses\n they are not passive but are living and moving powers\n however bhargava has asked which powers hold together the body which itself is formed of the elemental forces\n only one of them is the cohesive force which keeps the others in its magnetic field and enables them to assume form and function within that form\n to illustrate this pippalada gave him a parable saying that once all the elements claimed to be the dominant force in the body\n prana whereupon prana the primal energy supreme over them all said to them do not deceive yourselves\n it is i alone dividing myself fivefold who hold together this body and support it\n but they would not believe him\n even the smallest particle of the cosmos is the universal life in manifestation\n we see from this that the five elements are modifications of the cosmic life the prana vishwaprana that alyough the body seems to be formed only of the five elements the prana itself is the underlying substratum as the ocean is to the waves\n the body then is really nothing but prana as is anything else in the realm of relative existence\n even the smallest particle of the cosmos is the universal life in manifestation\n another point is the supposed conversation between the elements\n this is not just a device in a fable but is an indication that since all things are manifestations of cosmic life they can take on a seemingly independent life and even consciousness of their own\n this is a fundamental trait of maya the cosmic illusion one which lies at the root of most confusion and ignorance\n the proof prana to justify himself made as if he intended to leave the body\n but as he rose and appeared to be going all the rest realized that if he went they also would have to depart with him and as prana again seated himself the rest found their respective places\n as bees go out when their queen goes out and return when she returns so was it with speech mind vision hearing and the rest\n convinced of their error the powers now praised prana saying all the elements of the cosmos are rooted in prana\n it is the same with the elements and the senses in the individual s body complex for the human being has five bodies corresponding to the five elements \n just as the waves are in total dependence upon the ocean for their very being so everything cosmic and microcosmic depend upon prana\n this is why om is called the pranava it is the soundform of prana the mantric syllable by which the prana is contacted and controlled\n furthermore the breath also called prana is the outermost physical manifestation of prana\n because of this the yogi joins his inner intonations of om to his breath in the highest form of pranayama\n pranayama is accomplished by effortlessly breathing and joining to it the repetition of the sacred om\n that which causes all the pranas to prostrate themselves before and get merged in the paramatman the supreme soul god so as to attain identity with him is for that reason known as the pranava\n with om alone he should breathe\n pranayama is accomplished through concentrating the mind on om\n saubhagyalakshmi upanishad the pranava alone becomes the pranayama\n pranayama is composed of the pranava om\n therefore he should repeat the pranava mentally\n this only will be pranayama\n pranayama is accomplished by effortlessly breathing and joining to it the repetition of the sacred om\n yoga vashishtha the powers of prana he who controls prana controls all since prana is all\n therefore the elements praised prana saying as fire prana bums as the sun he shines as cloud he rains as indra he rules the gods as wind he blows as the moon he nourishes all\n he is that which is visible and also that which is invisible\n he is immortal life\n as spokes in the hub of a wheel so is everything made fast in prana the rik the yajur the sama all sacrifices the kshatriyas and the brahmins\n o prana lord of creation you movest in the womb and art born again\n to you who as breath dwellest in the body all creatures bring offerings\n thou as fire dost carry oblations to the gods and through you the fathers receive their offerings\n to every organ of sense you givest its function\n prana you art the creator you art the destroyer by your prowess and you art the protector\n thou movest in the sky as the sun and lord of lights art you\n prana when you showerest down rain your creatures rejoice hoping that they will find food as much as they desire\n thou art purity itself you art the master of all that exists you art fire the eater of offerings\n we the organs of sense offer to you your food to you the father of all\n that power of yours which dwells in speech in the ear and in the eye and which pervades the heart make that propitious and forsake us not\n whatsoever exists in the universe is dependent on you o prana\n protect us as a mother protects her children\n grant us prosperity and grant us wisdom\n obviously then the yogi cannot neglect the cultivation of prana and pranava together\n prana its history and nature sanatana dharma is not a shut up and believe and obey religion\n those who follow the eternal dharma must gain the fullest knowledge of how things work for wiyout that knowledge mastery will be impossible\n and mastery is the result of evolution\n prana the universal life force must be known about and mastered\n so conscious being when it was the turn of kousalya he put this question master of what is prana born how does he enter the body how does he live there after dividing himself how does he go out how does he experience what is outside and how does he hold together the body the senses and the mind all these questions are going to be answered subsequently so the only important point is the referring to prana as a conscious being which it is because it is the life of brahman and therefore is brahman\n the fact that everything is conscious is unique to the teachings of sanatana dharma\n science considers itself extremely bold in cautiously approaching this concept and tentatively postulating it\n those in the west who bravely make the statement as evident fact are those whose thinking has at least in its ancestry been derived from the wisdom of india\n the woryour questioner to which the sage replied kousalya you ask very difficult questions but since you are a sincere seeker after the truth of brahman i must answer\n this i have seen for myself in india\n the great saints just will not bother with the idly curious and the hopelessly shallow\n but they will gladly speak with those who are seeking the knowledge of reality\n once i made the mistake of taking a western spiritual wanderer to meet maitri devi a beloved saint in new delhi\n when he told her he wanted to ask a question she replied in hindi i do not speak english\n when he asked if someone could translate his questions she again responded i do not speak english\n so i said to him quietly tell me your question and i will ask it\n for quite some time he would softly tell me his questions and i would ask them in english and she would readily answer through a translator\n i appreciated her kindness to me but i also decided to never again bother her with roamabouts\n other saints i met would do the same some more diplomatically others not so tactful\n we should learn from this and question ourselves as to why we seek and even why we study to eventually reach the knowledge of god or just to cram more ideas in our head to show how wise we are yogananda often spoke of those who had spiritual indigestion from cramming useless philosophy into their minds\n but kousalya is a woryour questioner so the sage replies prana in us prana is born of the self\n like a man and his shadow the self and prana are inseparable\n prana enters the body at birth that the desires of the mind continuing from past lives may be fulfilled\n prashna upanishad just as the cosmos is an extension of the consciousness that is brahman in the same way our individual prana is an extension of our self atman \n it is inseparable from the self because it is the self\n this is the authentic non duality advaita of the upanishads not a negation or denial of either prakriti or prana\n seeing them as separate from spirit and therefore dual is the error not acknowledging their intimate reality\n prana provides the continuity between our present and past lives both minds and bodies\n it is also the force that enables the continuation of our evolution from past lives carries us through this present life and through future ones as well\n prana truly is life itself\n this verse also tells us that karma is a matter of the mind and not some external force\n change the mind and you change the karma or even dissolve it\n it need never extend into our external existence\n working out karma is not a compelling necessity\n we are never slaves to karma\n we are its creators and its masters at least potentially\n but we have forgotten that fact and lost control of our karma\n it must be regained if we would be free\n its associates as a king employs officials to rule over different portions of his kingdom so prana associates with himself four other pranas each a portion of himself and each assigned a separate function\n prashna upanishad we usually speak of five pranas but there is really only pure prana and its four modalities\n prana vital energy life breath life force\n in the human body the prana is divided into five forms prana the prana that moves upward apana the prana that moves downward producing the excretory functions in general\n vyana the prana that holds prana and apana together and produces circulation in the body\n samana the prana the carries the grosser material of food to the apana and brings the subtler material to each limb the general force of digestion\n udana the prana which brings up or carries down what has been drunk or eaten the general force of assimilation\n if this is kept in mind the following will be more comprehensible and meaningful\n the prana himself dwells in eye ear mouth and nose the apana which is the second prana rules the organs of excretion and generation the samana which is the third prana inhabits the navel and governs digestion and assimilation\n the self dwells in the lotus of the heart whence radiate a hundred and one nerves nadis \n from each of these proceed one hundred others which are smaller and from each of these again seventy two yousand others which are smaller still\n in all these moves the vyana which is the fourth prana\n and then at the moment of death through the nerve in the center of the spine the udana which is the fifth prana leads the virtuous man upward to higher birth the sinful man downward to lower birth and the man who is both virtuous and sinful to rebirth in the world of men\n this final verse is an interpretive translation saying more than is really there\n swami nikhilananda translates it literally and then udana ascending upward through one of them conducts the departing soul to the virtuous world for its virtuous deeds to the sinful world for its sinful deeds and to the world of men for both\n as you see there is no mention of a nerve in the center of the spine the sushumna\n the nadi of ascending consciousness is spoken of at the end of the katha upanishad thusly radiating from the lotus of the heart there are a hundred and one nerves\n one of these ascends toward the yousand petaled lotus in the brain\n if when a man comes to die his vital force passes upward and out through this nerve he attains immortality but if his vital force passes out through another nerve he goes to one or another plane of mortal existence and remains subject to birth and death\n katha upanishad here is what i wrote in comment on this verse by heart is meant the hub located in the midst of the upper trunk of the body of subtle passages known as nadis here translated nerves through which the life force prana circulates throughout the gross and subtle bodies just as the blood circulates from the heart through the veins of the physical body\n one hundred of these nadis direct the life force to the life processes of the bodies and are the forces of embodiment\n one unique nadi however rises directly upward from the heart hub into the head\n this nadi rises from the heart directly into the head it is not the passage in the midst of the spine\n if at the time of death the departing spirit leaves through that channel he gains immortality\n but if his consciousness attaches itself to any of the hundred other nadis he will be impelled into the subtle worlds that lead inexorably back to incarnation in relativity\n in every meditation by intoning om in time with the breath we activate this channel causing the life force to spontaneously and effortlessly flow upward into the yousand petalled lotus in the head toward the divine radiance that shines above and upon the upper levels of the brain lotus\n that divine light is the essence of om the life giving word the pranava\n then at the end of life having prepared himself by this practice sitting in meditation the yogi ascends upward from the body into the realm of immortality\n cosmic prana since each of us is a reflection of the universe there is a cosmic pranic arrangement also so the sage continues the sun is the prana of the universe\n it rises to help the prana in the eye of man to see\n the power of earth maintains the apana in man\n the ether between the sun and the earth is the samana and the allpervading air is the vyana\n the udana is fire and therefore he whose bodily heat has gone out dies after which his senses are absorbed in the mind and he is born again\n whatever his yought at the moment of death this it is that unites a man with prana who in turn uniting himself with udana and with the self leads the man to be reborn in the world he merits\n this final principle is the most important\n it is expanded in the gita in this way at the hour of death when a man leaves his body he must depart with his consciousness absorbed in me\n then he will be united with me\n be certain of that\n whatever a man remembers at the last when he is leaving the body will be realized by him in the hereafter because that will be what his mind has most constantly dwelt on during this life\n therefore you must remember me at all times and do your duty\n if your mind and heart are set upon me constantly you will come to me\n make a habit of practicing meditation and do not let your mind be distracted\n in this way you will come finally to the lord who is the light giver the highest of the high\n this is why the japa and meditation of om is the way as patanjali states in the yoga sutras the knowing of prana immortality the importance of knowing the functions of prana by direct experience through yoga practice is summed up by the sage saying the progeny of him who knows prana as i have revealed him to you is never cut off and he himself becomes immortal\n it was said of old one who knows the prana whence he has his source how he enters the body how he lives there after dividing himself five fold what are his inner workings such an one attains to immortality yea even to immortality\n for as the other upanishads declare prana is brahman\n the witnessing self the one in the three gargya then asked master when a man s body sleeps who is it within that sleeps and who is awake and who is dreaming who then experiences happiness and with whom are all the sense organs united anyone who ponders the nature of consciousness comes to realize that there are three modes of experience waking dream and dreamless sleep\n all three of these states are experienced by a single witness who says i slept wiyout dream i slept and dreamed and i am now awake\n who is that witness this is gargya s inquiry\n who is the unchanging witness of change who is the unseen seer for no intelligent person of unclouded intellect can doubt the existence of such a one\n sleep as the rays of the sun o gargya when he sets replied the sage gather themselves up in his disk of light to come out again when he rises so the senses gather themselves up in the mind the highest of them all\n therefore when a man does not hear see smell taste touch speak grasp enjoy we say that he sleeps\n only the pranas are then awake in the body and the mind is led nearer to the self\n prashna upanishad prana is the primal life force or vital energy\n the prana that manifests in the evolving universe also manifests in the evolving body of each human being\n in the body there are five basic forms of prana prana the prana that moves upward apana the prana that moves downward producing the excretory functions in general\n vyana the prana that holds prana and apana together and produces circulation in the body\n samana the prana that carries the grosser material of food to the apana and brings the subtler material to each limb the general force of digestion\n udana the prana which brings up or carries down what has been drunk or eaten the general force of assimilation\n the pranas also correspond to the five elements earth prithvi water apa fire tejas air vayu and ether akasha \n one of these five elements is the foundation for one of the five senses earth smell water taste fire sight air touch and ether hearing speech\n in the waking state all the pranas are quite active and fundamentally outflowing even those that maintain the internal functions of the body being externalized through being expended in the fulfillment of their tasks\n but in sleep they withdraw into the inner reservoirs of the body and the state of sleep occurs\n on the subtlest energy level they withdraw into the manas the energy field we call the mind\n for the mind is the highest sense being the sum and goal of them all\n it is not amiss to say that the senses serve the mind at least when the right order prevails\n otherwise they drag the mind helplessly along addicting and enslaving it\n breaking the web of this addiction slavery is then impossible wiyout the practice of pranayama control and refinement of the pranas\n for this reason all viable spiritual traditions have methods that involve breath the most objective manifestation of prana to some degree\n when the pranas withdraw into the mind their distracting activities lessen unless they occupy and overwhelm the mind with constant and vivid dreaming\n when if the mind is thus granted a reprieve from their clamor it begins to sense what is behind it just as it is behind the senses\n the mind is the witness of the senses but it is also witnessed\n that ultimate witness is the self\n therefore the upanishad says that in sleep the mind is led nearer to the self\n dreams and dreamlessness where do dreams come from gargya has not asked but pippalada tells him while in dream the mind revives its past impressions\n whatever it has seen it sees again whatever it has heard it hears again whatever it has enjoyed in various countries and in various quarters of the earth it enjoys again\n what has been seen and not seen heard and not heard enjoyed and not enjoyed both the real and the unreal it sees yea it sees all\n everyone is creative in the dream state yough some are definitely better writer directors of their inner movies than others\n he continues when the mind is overpowered by deep slumber it dreams no more\n it rests happily in the body\n prashna upanishad from the very first yogis have spoken of the importance of the dreamless deep sleep state they call sushupti\n this is because in dreamless sleep we are aware of awareness itself with no interference from the senses\n we are aware deep within ourselves aware of our nature as simple pure consciousness\n dreamless sleep is also proof that the self exists\n for alyough no objects are presented to the mind there is a witness of that non experiencing\n otherwise we would not awaken and say i slept but had no dreams at all\n instead we would not know any time had passed would not know that we had been asleep\n that witness which cognizes the waking dream and dreamless states is the atman itself\n there is a higher form when sushupti the dreamless sleep state is rightly cognized experienced while conscious says the shandilya upanishad\n in that state we are asleep while awake and are fully conscious of the fact\n this is very near the actual experience of the self and partakes of that experience to some degree the happiness and ease we feel being a touch of the joy ananda that is the nature of the self\n it is extremely valuable because it shows us that when all sensory experience is gone beyond there yet remains the truth of ourselves in the form of pure unconditioned consciousness that is the self\n in deep meditation we enter this state intentionally and begin working our inner transformation from this center by the subtle intonations of om\n to the self as birds my friend fly to a tree for rest even so do all these things fly to the self earth and its peculiar essence water and its peculiar essence fire and its peculiar essence air and its peculiar essence ether and its peculiar essence the eye and what it sees the ear and what it hears the nose and what it smells the tongue and what it tastes the skin and what it touches the voice and what it speaks the hands and what they grasp the feet and what they walk on the mind and what it perceives the intellect and what it understands the ego and what it appropriates the heart and what it loves light and what it illumines energy and what it binds together\n they fly to the self because the self is their origin\n they are returning to their source after ages upon ages of separation in relative existence experience\n for verily it is the self that sees hears smells tastes thinks knows acts\n he is brahman whose essence is knowledge\n he is the immutable self the supreme\n the self is the experiencer in all beings the knower of all things and the doer of all acts\n this points out the fact that maya illusion is the misperception of things not perception itself\n also sense experience yought and actions are not illusions\n it is our misunderstanding of them that is illusion\n the self is real and its experiences are real\n it is true that they are purely mental in nature but is the mind not real again it is a matter how we perceive\n the self is a wave of the ocean of brahman the absolute whose nature is consciousness\n the self is immutable and beyond it there is nothing else for in essence it is one with brahman the ultimate being\n yet the self needs to attain itself needs to attain the consciousness of its being which is brahman\n therefore the sage says further the end result he who knows the immutable the pure the shadowless the bodiless the colorless attains to brahman o my friend\n such an one becomes all knowing and he dwells in all beings\n of him it is written he who knows that immutable self wherein live the mind the senses the pranas the elements verily such an one knows all things and realizes the self in all\n prashna upanishad this is most important for it indicates that first we know the self the individual self the jivatman and then we are enabled to know the supreme self the paramatman brahman\n and the self we will know is itself immutable\n eternally changeless incapable of being either diminished or increased for it is one with the infinite\n ever only itself never really being influenced or changed by any thing whatsoever\n untainted by any contact for it is untouchable\n the self is pure light within which there is no shadow of darkness or differentiation\n it is always exactly what it is bodiless\n it is perfectly non dual\n it is neither inside or outside of any thing\n it cannot be contained\n it is absolutely one having nothing appended to it or necessary to it\n it has no qualities or characteristics but is always i am\n the three gunas are not present in it nor are any gradations of any kind\n all we can really say about it is what it is not\n all of these terms indicate that the self is the same as brahman\n and the self that knows its self brahman wherein live the mind the senses the pranas the elements does in truth come to know all things and the self in all things\n omniscience and omnipresence are experienced by that liberated spirit who knows its oneness with the all\n meditation on om so far the questions put to pippalada have been about the components of the human organism which both empower and limit it\n in the last section the subject of the self was considered specifically the nature of the self and the results of knowing the self\n now we approach the subject of the way in which the self is known\n wiyout knowing this all the foregoing teaching is pointless\n life and death whereupon satyakama coming near to the master said venerable sir if a man meditate upon the syllable om all his life what shall be his reward after death satyakama understood that what really mattered was not short term gain in this life but the state of consciousness that would determine where the individual would go after death when stripped of body possessions relationships and all that is of the earth earthly when he has nothing but his degree of evolution to determine his future\n so he wants to know what will be the result of meditating on om throughout one s life\n literally the sanskrit texts asks what will be the result of intense meditation abhidhyana on om and what world loka will be won jayati by means of that meditation\n for the world in which we find ourselves after death reveals our fundamental state of consciousness\n the supreme attainment and the master answered him thus satyakama om is brahman both the conditioned and the unconditioned the personal and the impersonal\n by meditating upon it the wise man may attain either the one or the other\n brahman is absolutely one but from our present perspective seems to be of a dual character\n in this verse the expression higher para and lower apara are used yough prabhavananda has used the explanatory translations conditioned and the unconditioned and the personal and the impersonal\n it is more usual to use the terms nirguna wiyout attributes or qualities guna and saguna with attributes or qualities in relation to brahman\n in a brief sanskrit glossary nirguna brahman is defined as the impersonal attributeless absolute beyond all description or designation\n saguna brahman is defined as the supreme absolute conceived of as endowed with qualities like mercy omnipotence omniscience omnipotence etc\n as distinguished from the undifferentiated absolute nirguna brahman\n nirguna brahman is the higher brahman and saguna brahman is the lower or lesser\n again this distinction is just a means of expression adopted for the limitations of our human intellects\n presently it is commonly assumed erroneously that there is one way to meditate on nirguna brahman and another way to meditate on saguna brahman\n but this was not so in the upanishadic era as can be seen from the texts cited in both om yoga and the word that is god\n it was understood that om is allinclusive since it is brahman itself\n consequently meditation on om is meditation on both nirguna and saguna brahman\n our perceptions will be according to whichever aspect we wish to contact\n according to our knowing it also depends on our experience knowlege of om not mere intellectual ideas\n for pippalada then says if he meditate upon om with but little knowledge of its meaning but nevertheless is enlightened thereby upon his death he will be immediately born again on this earth and during his new life he will be devoted to austerity continence and faith and will attain to spiritual greatness\n prashna upanishad that is if for whatever reasons the yogi gains but little experience knowledge of om still he will be enlightened by it to some degree\n this being so he will not spend a long period in the astral world but will quickly be reborn so he can take up yoga again and make better progress than he did before\n to ensure this in his new life he will be devoted to austerity continence and faith and will attain to spiritual greatness\n if again he meditate upon om with a greater knowledge of its meaning upon his death he will ascend to the lunar heaven and after he has partaken of its pleasures will return again to earth\n the lunar heaven is the astral world in which the yogi experiences great happiness and even power according to the immense strength of positive karma which is engendered by the practice of yoga\n yet he will in time take birth again on the earth\n but if he meditate upon om in the full consciousness that it is one with god upon his death he will be united with the light that is in the sun he will be freed from evil even as a snake is freed from its slough and he will ascend to god s dwelling place\n there he will realize brahman who evermore abides in the heart of all beings brahman supreme those who experience in meditation that om truly is divinity itself is their own divine self will be freed from the compulsion to earthly rebirth as well as all that has bound them to lower things and united with the light of spirit that invisibly shines upon us through the intermediary of the sun will ascend to the heights of existence and beyond into the transcendent being of nirguna brahman\n then pippalada cites two verses even older than the upanishads that encapsulate all this concerning the sacred syllable om it is written the syllable om when it is not fully understood does not lead beyond mortality\n when it is fully understood and meditation is therefore rightly directed a man is freed from fear whether he be awake dreaming or sleeping the dreamless sleep and attains to brahman\n by virtue of a little understanding of om a man returns to earth after death\n by virtue of a greater understanding he attains to the celestial sphere\n by virtue of a complete understanding he learns what is known only to the seers\n the sage with the help of om reaches brahman the fearless the undecaying the immortal as sri ramana maharshi said om ever shines within us as the self\n may we all realize this\n where is the self lastly sukesa approached the sage and said holy sir hiranyanabha prince of kosala once asked me this question sukesa do you know the self and his sixteen parts i replied i do not\n surely if i had known them i should have taught them to you\n i will not lie for he who lies perishes root and all\n the prince silently mounted his chariot and went away\n so now i ask of you where is the self this is an introduction to the actual teachings of this section but it contains a couple of interesting points\n sixteen parts the self is said in this verse to have sixteen parts\n yet the self is one so how can this be the upanishad is referring to the extensions or instruments of the self by means of which it manifests within relative existence\n they will be enumerated shortly\n spiritual honesty it is impressive when a spiritual teacher honestly admits to not knowing something\n in a filmed interview carl jung was asked what he yought some dream symbol meant\n he laughed and said i haven t the faintest idea end of question here we see the integrity of sukesha who readily admitted not knowing the answer to a question\n and his reason he gives saying i will not lie for he who lies perishes root and all\n satya truthfulness is one of the essential observances of yoga according to patanjali and here we see why\n this should be taken to heart by us throughout our life\n sri ramakrishna said that a person can realize god by scrupulously adhering to truth\n abode of the self where is the self the sage replied my child within this body dwells the self from whom sprang the sixteen parts of the universe and in this manner they came into being\n how precious then is the human body and how foolish it is to think that spiritual experience will involve escaping from the body and flying off to some spiritual world to hobnob with angels and masters now he will describe the sequence of cosmic manifestation\n stabilizing itself within creation if creating i enter my creation the self reflected what is there to bind me to it what is there to go out from it when i go out to stay within it when i stay this is a problem for both the infinite and the finite selves\n pondering thus and in answer to his yought he made prana and from prana he made desire and from desire he made ether air fire water earth the senses the mind and food and from food he made vigor penance the vedas the sacrificial rites and all the worlds\n thereafter in the worlds he created names\n and the number of the elements he thus created was sixteen\n we need to take this part by part\n pondering thus and in answer to his yought he made \n the world was made by the mere yought of god\n as said before this is the dream of god it is all creative yought\n merely thinking of something gets us human beings nowhere we have to bring it into manifestation by action and materials\n this is not the case with god\n he yought and so it was\n consequently in the following list of cosmic ingredients we must not think of them as stuff but as cosmic youghts\n first the universal life force vishwaprana was manifested\n this was the formless basic substance of relative existence\n next came the power of intention or aspiration\n for unless we are motivated with the idea that something can be attained we will not act\n so the power to desire or will and thereby to shape and work with the cosmic prana is absolutely necessary for anything to happen\n desire is the explanatory translation of prabhavananda and i think it is the best one\n but the actual word in the sanskrit is shraddha faith\n this was used shankara says to mean a stimulus to the individual spirits jivas \n that is subliminally all of us know that we have come from god and are intended to return to god\n with this aspiration as the deepest impulse of our being we are moving up the evolutionary path ever onward however many delays our ignorance and laziness may bring about\n ether air fire water earth the great primal elements and all their variations down to their material manifestations\n actually the word is indriyam which means organs and often does mean only the five organs of perception jnanendriyas ear skin eye tongue and nose but shankara feels and so do i that it no doubt includes the five organs of action karmendriyas voice hand foot organ of excretion and the organ of generation\n the indriyas are here being yought of as wrappings of the individual consciousness as well as being instruments of bodily function\n the indriyas are unconscious\n that which activates them is the mind which both perceives and acts through them\n by this term is meant all that goes to affect the evolving consciousness from physical food to psychological and intellectual impressions that shape and move our development either forward or backward according to their character\n that this is so is demonstrated by those things that are said to be made from food vigor\n virya is the strength and energy than manifests in body mind and intellect especially as will power in the yogi\n tapasya is practical spiritual disciplines such as moral observances self purification and the practice of meditation\n the word is not veda but mantra words of power which produce changes spiritually mentally and physically by their repetition\n from vigor comes the capacity for spiritual discipline which is manifested in the form of the repetition japa and meditation dhyana centered on mantras especially the supreme mantra om\n this is not only an interpretive translation it is a very narrowing one\n the actual word is karma a very wide and far reaching matter indeed\n here it means the law of action reaction which fuels the very existence of the world and our bodies within it\n karma causes the manifestation of the cosmos and impels all sentient beings to take incarnation within it in forms appropriate to their level of consciousness and the nature of their past deeds both physical and mental\n certainly merit producing actions are part of karma but karma is much more\n the many worlds lokas are produced in response to the varying degrees of evolution and past karma of the sentient beings within them\n the prime factor in relative existence is nama name\n this seems very peculiar to those whose philosophy does not postulate that everything is ideation yought\n but the primeval sages of india perceived through their meditation that the youghtform the idea that is the matrix around which the body vehicle of any manifested entity forms itself is that entity s name\n in the depths of their meditation the sages perceived the primal yought of each thing\n since everything is formed of vibration they translated that into spoken forms\n in all other languages a word is just an agreed upon symbol of an object but in sanskrit each word is a sound form of the basic energy pattern of the designated object\n sanskrit is a kind of sonic physics creative speech\n for that reason sanskrit script is call devanagari the city of the gods meaning that the divine powers manifesting as all objects dwell in the sanskrit words\n in the subtle levels of being the sanskrit word is the thing designated by the word\n that is why it is stated that the name of god is god om is divinity itself\n see the section entitled the glories and powers of om in om yoga and the word that is god\n these are the sixteen parts of the cosmic and the individual selves\n the great return as the flowing rivers whose destination is the sea having reached it disappear in it losing their names and forms and men speak only of the sea so these sixteen parts created from out his own being by the self the eternal seer having returned to him from whom they came disappear in him their destination losing their names and forms and people speak only of the self\n then for man the sixteen parts are no more and he attains to immortality\n thus was it said of old the sixteen parts are spokes projecting from the self who is the hub of the wheel\n the self is the goal of knowledge\n know him and go beyond death\n there is an important principle here all that exists has emanated from the cosmic self and is withdrawn into it and the same is true of our many levels they have come from the true us and will remerge in us\n the idea that the world is to be discarded escaped from so we can be free is as illusory as the world from which we wish to rid ourselves\n it is ignorance alone that we need to banish\n we need to refine all our bodies through the practice of tapasya so they will be seen as nothing more than the projections of our mind projections that can be reabsorbed in the state of perfect knowing\n the macrocosm and the microcosm are both proper to spirit and spirit\n they are not impositions or prisons yough we make them so but rays of the self\n they exist because we exist\n the only path to the self is that of knowledge\n once that arises within us death dissolves and immortality alone remains\n the right ending the sage concluded saying what i have told you is all that can be said about the self the supreme brahman\n beyond this there is naught\n so anything more we may say that has not already been said in the upanishads and the gita will really be nothing worthless and pointless if not outright self deception\n this merits being taken to heart\n we should toss away our books of idle philosophy and speculation and become genuine yogis\n then we will truly know that which is to be known\n so the disciples worshiped the sage and said you are indeed our father\n you have led us beyond the sea of ignorance\n we bow down to all the great seers obeisance to the great seers those who teach us the truth of the self and more the way to realize the self they are our true fathers begetting us in knowledge\n they are woryour of worship archanam and all honor\n they are the gods that lead us to god\n namah paramarishibhyah salutations to the great rishis ",
    "Munda": "om o gods may we hear auspicious words with the ears while engaged in sacrifices may we see auspicious things with the eyes while praising the gods with steady limbs may we enjoy a life that is beneficial to the gods\n may indra of ancient fame be auspicious to us may the supremely rich or all knowing pusa god of the earth be propitious to us may garuda the destroyer of evil be well disposed towards us may brihaspati ensure our welfare\n om peace peace peace om brahma the creator of the universe and the protector of the world was the first among the gods to manifest himself\n to his eldest son atharva he imparted that knowledge of brahman that is the basis of all knowledge\n the knowledge of brahman that brahma imparted to atharva atharva transmitted to angir in days of yore\n he angir passed it on to satyavaha of the line of bharadvaja\n he of the line of bharadvaja handed down to angiras this knowledge that had been received in succession from the higher by the lower ones\n saunaka well known as a great householder having approached angiras duly asked o adorable sir which is that thing which having been known all this becomes known to him he said there are two kinds of knowledge to be acquired the higher and the lower this is what as tradition runs the knowers of the import of the vedas say\n of these the lower comprises the rig veda yajur veda sama veda atharva veda the science of pronunciation etc\n the code of rituals grammar etymology metre and astrology\n then there is the higher knowledge by which is attained that imperishable\n by the higher knowledge the wise realize everywhere that which cannot be perceived and grasped which is wiyout source features eyes and ears which has neither hands nor feet which is eternal multiformed all pervasive extremely subtle and undiminishing and which is the source of all\n as a spider spreads out and withdraws its thread as on the earth grow the herbs and trees and as from a living man issues out hair on the head and body so out of the imperishable does the universe emerge here in this phenomenal creation \n through knowledge brahman increases in size\n from that is born food the unmanifested \n from food evolves prana hiranyagarbha thence the cosmic mind thence the five elements thence the worlds thence the immortality that is in karmas\n from him who is omniscient in general and all knowing in detail and whose austerity is constituted by knowledge evolve this derivative brahman name colour and food\n that thing that is such is true\n the karmas that the wise discovered in the mantras are accomplished variously in the context of the sacrifice where the three vedic duties get united\n you perform them for ever with desire for the true results\n this is your path leading to the fruits of karma acquired by yourselves\n when the fire being set ablaze the flame shoots up one should offer the oblations into that part that is in between the right and the left\n the agnihotra destroys the seven worlds of that man whose agnihotra sacrifice is wiyout darsa and paurnamasa rites devoid of chaturmasya bereft of agrayana unblest with guests goes unperformed is unaccompanied by vaisvadeva rite and is performed perfunctorily\n kali karali manojava and sulohita and that which is sudhumravarna as also sphulingini and the shining visvaruchi these are the seven flaming tongues\n these oblations turn into the rays of the sun and taking him up they lead him who performs the rites in these shining flames at the proper time to where the single lord of the gods presides over all\n saying come come uttering pleasing words such as this is your well earned virtuous path which leads to heaven and offering him adoration the scintillating oblations carry the sacrificer along the rays of the sun\n since these eighteen constituents of a sacrifice on whom the inferior karma has been said to rest are perishable because of their fragility therefore those ignorant people who get elated with the idea this is the cause of bliss undergo old age and death over again\n remaining within the fold of ignorance and thinking we are ourselves wise and learned the fools while being buffeted very much ramble about like the blind led by the blind alone\n continuing diversely in the midst of ignorance the unenlightened take airs by thinking we have attained the goal\n since the men engaged in karma do not understand the truth under the influence of attachment thereby they become afflicted with sorrow and are deprived of heaven on the exhaustion of the results of karma\n the deluded fools believing the rites inculcated by the vedas and the smriit is to be the highest do not understand the other thing that leads to liberation\n they having enjoyed the fruits of actions in the abode of pleasure on the heights of heaven enter this world or an inferior one\n those who live in the forest while begging for alms viz\n those forest dwellers and hermits who resort to the duties of their respective stages of life as well as to meditation and the learned householders who have their senses under control they after becoming freed from dirt go by the path of the sun to where lives that purusha immortal and undecaying by nature\n a brahmana should resort to renunciation after examining the worlds acquired through karma with the help of this maxim there is nothing here that is not the result of karma so what is the need of performing karma for knowing that reality he should go with sacrificial faggots in hand only to a teacher versed in the vedas and absorbed in brahman\n to him who has approached duly whose heart is calm and whose outer organs are under control that man of enlightenment should adequately impart that knowledge of brahman by which one realizes the true and imperishable purusha\n that thing that is such is true\n as from a fire fully ablaze fly off sparks in their yousands that are akin to the fire similarly o goodlooking one from the imperishable originate different kinds of creatures and into it again they merge\n the purusha is transcendental since he is formless\n and since he is coextensive with all that is external and internal and since he is birthless therefore he is wiyout vital force and wiyout mind he is pure and superior to the other superior imperishable maya \n from him originates the vital force as well as the mind all the senses space air fire water and earth that supports everything\n the indwelling self of all is surely he of whom the heaven is the head the moon and sun are the two eyes the directions are the two ears the revealed vedas are the speech air is the vital force the whole universe is the heart and it is he from whose two feet emerged the earth\n from him emerges the fire i\n heaven of which the fuel is the sun\n from the moon emerges cloud and from cloud the herbs and corns on the earth\n a man sheds the semen into a woman\n from the purusha have originated many creatures\n from him emerge the rik sama and yajur mantras initiation all the sacrifices whether with or wiyout the sacrificial stake offerings to brahmanas the year the sacrificer and the worlds where the moon sacrifices all and where the sun shines \n and from him duly emerged the gods in various groups the sadhyas human beings beasts birds life rice and barley as well as austerity faith truth continence and dutifulness\n from him emerge the seven sense organs the seven flames the seven kinds of fuel the seven oblations and these seven seats where move the sense organs that sleep in the cavity and have been deposited by god in groups of seven\n from him emerge all the oceans and all the mountains\n from him flow out the rivers of various forms\n and from him issue all the corns as well as the juice by virtue of which the internal self verily exists in the midst of the elements\n the purusha alone is all this comprising karma and knowledge\n he who knows this supreme immortal brahman existing in the heart destroys here the knot of ignorance o good looking one it is effulgent near at hand and well known as moving in the heart and it is the great goal\n on it are fixed all these that move breathe and wink or do not wink\n know this one which comprises the gross and the subtle which is beyond the ordinary knowledge of creatures and which is the most desirable and the highest of all\n that which is bright and is subtler than the subtle and that on which are fixed all the worlds as well as the dwellers of the worlds is this immutable brahman it is this vital force it again is speech and mind\n this entity that is such is true\n it is to be penetrated o good looking one shoot at it \n taking hold of the bow the great weapon familiar in the upanishads one should fix on it an arrow sharpened with meditation\n drawing the string o good looking one hit that very target that is the imperishable with the mind absorbed in its yought\n om is the bow the soul is the arrow and brahman is called its target\n it is to be hit by an unerring man\n one should become one with it just like an arrow\n know that self alone that is one wiyout a second on which are strung heaven the earth and the inter space the mind and the vital forces together with all the other organs and give up all other talks\n this is the bridge leading to immortality\n within that heart in which are fixed the nerves like the spokes on the hub of a chariot wheel moves this aforesaid self by becoming multiformed\n meditate on the self thus with the help of om\n may you be free from hindrances in going to the other shore beyond darkness\n that self which is omniscient in general and all knowing in detail and which has such glory in this world that self which is of this kind is seated in the space within the luminous city of brahman\n it is conditioned by the mind it is the carrier of the vital forces and the body it is seated in food by placing the intellect in the cavity of the heart \n through their knowledge the discriminating people realize that self as existing in its fullness everywhere the self that shines surpassingly as blissfulness and immortality\n when that self which is both the high and the low is realized the knot of the heart gets united all doubts become solved and all one s actions become dissipated\n in the supreme bright sheath is brahman free from taints and wiyout parts\n it is pure and is the light of lights\n it is that which the knowers of the self realize\n there the sun does not shine nor the moon or the stars nor do these flashes of lightning shine there\n how can this fire do so everything shines according as he does so by his light all this shines diversely\n all this that is in front is but brahman the immortal\n brahman is at the back as also on the right and the left\n it is extended above and below too\n this world is nothing but brahman the highest\n two birds that are ever associated and have similar names cling to the same tree\n of these one eats the fruit of divergent tastes and the other looks on wiyout eating\n on the same tree the individual soul remains drowned i\n stuck as it were and so it moans being worried by its impotence\n when it sees thus the other the adored lord and his glory then it becomes liberated from sorrow\n when the seer sees the purusha the golden hued creator lord and the source of the inferior brahman then the illumined one completely shakes off both merit and demerit becomes taintless and attains absolute equality\n this one is verily the vital force which shines divergently through all beings\n knowing this the illumined man has no further occasion to go beyond anything in his talk\n he disports in the self delights in the self and is engrossed in spiritual effort\n this one is the chief among the knowers of brahman\n the bright and pure self within the body that the monks with habitual effort and attenuated blemishes see is attainable verily through truth concentration complete knowledge and continence pracit ised constantly\n truth alone wins and not untruth\n by truth is laid the path called devayana by which the desireless seers ascend to where exists the supreme treasure attainable through truth\n it is great and self effulgent and its form is unthinkable\n it is subtler than the subtle\n it is farther away than the far off and it is near at hand in this body\n among sentient beings it is perceived as seated in this very body in the cavity of the heart\n it is not comprehended through the eye nor through speech nor through the other senses nor is it attained through austerity or karma\n since one becomes purified in mind through the favourableness of the intellect therefore can one see that indivisible self through meditation\n within the heart in the body where the vital force has entered in five forms is this subtle self to be realized through that intelligence by which is pervaded the entire mind as well as the motor and sensory organs of all creatures\n and it is to be known in the mind which having become purified this self reveals itself distinctly\n the man of pure mind wins those worlds which he mentally wishes for and those enjoyable things which he covets\n therefore one desirous of prosperity should adore the knower of the self\n he knows this supreme abode this brahman in which is placed the universe and which shines holy\n those wise ones indeed who having become desireless worship this enlightened person transcend this human seed\n he who covets the desirable things while brooding on the virtues is born amidst those very surroundings along with the desires\n but for one who has got his wishes fulfilled and who is selfpoised all the longings vanish even here\n this self is not attained through study nor through the intellect nor through much hearing\n the very self which this one i\n the aspirant seeks is attainable through that fact of seeking this self of his reveals its own nature\n this self is not attained by one devoid of strength nor through delusion nor through knowledge unassociated with monasticism\n but the self of that knower who strives through these means enters into the abode that is brahman\n having attained this the seers become contented with their knowledge established in the self freed from attachment and composed\n having realized the all pervasive one everywhere these discriminating people ever merged in contemplation enter into the all\n those to whom the entity presented by the vedantic knowledge has become fully ascertained who are assiduous and have become pure in mind through the yoga of monasticism all of them at the supreme moment of final departure become identified with the supreme immortality in the worlds that are brahman and they become freed on every side\n to their sources repair the fifteen constituents of the body and to their respective gods go all the gods of the senses \n the karmas and the soul appearing like the intellect all become unified with the supreme undecaying\n as rivers flowing down become indistinguishable on reaching the sea by giving up their names and forms so also the illumined soul having become freed from name and form reaches the self effulgent purusha that is higher than the higher maya \n anyone who knows that supreme brahman becomes brahman indeed\n in his line is not born anyone who does not know brahman\n he overcomes grief and rises above aberrations and becoming freed from the knots of the heart he attains immortality\n this rule has been revealed by the mantra which runs thus to them alone should one expound this knowledge of b who are engaged in the practice of disciplines versed in the vedas and indeed devoted to brahman who personally sacrifice to the fire called ekarsi with faith and by whom has been duly accomplished the vow of holding fire on the head\n the seer angiras spoke of this truth in the days of yore\n one that has not fulfilled the vow does not read this\n salutation to the great seers\n salutation to the great seers\n om o gods may we hear auspicious words with the ears while engaged in sacrifices may we see auspicious things with the eyes while praising the gods with steady limbs may we enjoy a life that is beneficial to the gods\n may indra of ancient fame be auspicious to us may the supremely rich or all knowing pusa god of the earth be propitious to us may garuda the destroyer of evil be well disposed towards us may brihaspati ensure our welfare\n om peace peace peace here ends the mundakopanishad included in the atharva veda\n commentary on the mundaka upanishad by swami nirmalananda giri knowing the all it is an interesting trait of the western mind that it wants encapsulations of things lists of essentials advice on shortcuts and what is the one thing in every department of life and yought\n whether this is a desire for efficiency or a form of intellectual minimalism or outright laziness is hard to say chances are it varies from person to person\n nevertheless getting to the heart of the matter is something dear to the heart of americans especially\n they are not alone in this attitude\n the upanishads reflect the same mentality\n perhaps that is why vivekananda considered the west and america particularly as being more suited to the teachings of vedanta the upanishads than the contemporary east\n in the first section of the mundaka upanishad we find the highest expression of this attitude out of the infinite ocean of existence arose brahma first born and foremost among the gods\n from him sprang the universe and he became its protector\n the knowledge of brahman the foundation of all knowledge he revealed to his first born son atharva\n a pre creation story according to indian texts at the beginning of the present creation cycle brahma that person who was destined to be the creator projector of the three worlds awoke to find himself in infinite empty space\n at first he felt fear but then he laughed at his foolishness for there was no one there but him\n who would he fear then he pondered his situation attempting to comprehend it\n at one point a great voice resounded all around him saying a single word tapa meaning do tapasya\n this awakened brahma s memory of yoga meditation so he began to mediate\n after some time he attained full memory of his past as well as the knowledge of how to create the worlds which he did\n he also became established in direct perception of brahman\n among his children brought forth through his meditation was atharva to whom he taught the way to realize brahman\n in turn atharva taught this same knowledge of brahman to angi\n angi again taught it to satyabaha who revealed it to angiras\n the essence of knowledge to angiras came upon a time sounaka the famous householder and asked respectfully holy sir what is that by which all else is known we have already been told that the knowledge of brahman brahmavidya is the foundation of all knowledge\n but sounaka has a very salutary impatience and ambition\n he wants to know what is the one thing which being known causes all to be known\n this is both a wise quest and a wise attitude\n little red riding hood ended up in the wolf s stomach because she dawdled on the way instead of going straight to her destination\n if we look at the history of religions we will find that the countries which produce the most enlightened persons are those countries which have produced empires\n for when such people turn to spiritual life they go after the loftiest spiritual attainments they become imperialists of the spirit they seek out the most direct way and go there\n sounaka is one of them and hopefully so are we\n knowledge is the subject of the question so angiras lays a foundation for his answer\n those who know brahman replied angiras say that there are two kinds of knowledge the higher and the lower\n the lower is knowledge of the vedas the rik the sama the yajur and the atharva and also of phonetics ceremonials grammar etymology metre and astronomy\n the higher is knowledge of that by which one knows the changeless reality\n analysis of knowledge now we should look at this very carefully\n first of all who do we believe when i first emerged from the deadly cocoon of fundamentalist protestanit ism my intellectual world was quite simple simplistic actually\n fortunately i first read the bhagavad gita and then autobiography of a yogi\n the next step was to get out of my deadly environment so within a few months i was on the plane to california and wider horizons\n but i discovered in a short time that wider horizons can have a drawback\n i began encountering just about every shade of philosophical and religious yought and attitude most of them incompatible with each other\n almost daily i was told conflicting things and always with the utmost confidence\n as someone once said the problem with ignorance is that it picks up confidence as it goes along\n i loved being in the wide open mental spaces of california and i still do but which way should i go who could or should i trust since i had been shaken out of my spiritual entombment by learning of the yoga tradition i wisely followed the principle that only those who know god really know anything\n so i sought out the teachings of illumined yogis of past and present discarding those inauspicious indian teachers who claimed to have a new revelation for a new age and only paying attention to those who were right in the center of the eternal dharma\n once somebody asked me what a great yogi s distinctive teachings were\n none i replied with sait isfaction\n if he taught anything new i would have nothing to do with him\n i appreciated it if the english was good and equally if the book was free from typos and expressed in a way that someone in the twentieth century like myself could comprehend but i wanted to know what all the great yogis throughout history knew the tried and proven way to god\n my great blessing was being able to trek many times to the vedanta bookshop in hollywood\n there i found an abundance of eternal wisdom the same wisdom that had been flowing in a life giving stream for countless ages like the holy ganga\n the ganga that emerges at gangotri high in the himalayas is the same ganga that flows into the ocean at gangasagar\n in the same way i found on the shelves of that little shop the same sanatana dharma spoken by the primeval sages of india\n a little further east in hollywood at the self realization fellowship i listened every sunday to an ideal presentation of both the philosophy and spiritual practice of eternal india\n all this prepared me for india where as a friend of ours once said about the same pilgrimage i got the idea\n and have treasured it ever since\n so those who know brahman say that there are two kinds of knowledge the higher and the lower\n the lower they say is the knowledge of scriptures ritual philosophic expression and suchlike including by the way astrology\n please note that they do not denounce these things as useless or as ignorance\n they are definitely said to be knowledge and a sensible person appreciates and learns them to a reasonable and practical degree\n but it must be understood that the essential the higher is knowledge of that by which one knows the changeless reality brahman\n the knowledge which enables us to know is to be sought for and prized above all else\n while writing this previous sentence i could clearly hear in memory the recorded voice of yogananda saying i walked my feet off from cape cormorin to the himalayas in search of the knowledge that would reveal god to him\n the lesser knowledge tells us only of that which changes including our own short physical life\n but the higher knowledge brings us to the changeless reality\n by this is fully revealed to the wise that which transcends the senses which is uncaused which is indefinable which has neither eyes nor ears neither hands nor feet which is all pervading subtler than the subtlest the everlasting the source of all\n the absolute consciousness the totality of being is shown to the wise to the yogis by this knowledge\n and the world what about this world in which we find ourselves is it to be despised as worthless and antithetical to brahman our goal lest we think such a foolish thing angiras further says as the web comes out of the spider and is withdrawn as plants grow from the soil and hair from the body of man so springs the universe from the eternal brahman\n the world then is an extension or emanation of brahman\n in other words the world is brahman\n we are living and moving in divinity manifesting as the world\n why then do we say that the world is illusory it is the world in our mind our perception our interpretation of the world that is an illusion not the world itself\n in indian texts we continually find the simile of the snake in a rope or a man in tree\n that is in darkness we see a rope lying on the ground and immediately see a snake lying there we see the glitter of its eyes and may even hear it hiss yet when light is brought we see only a rope\n the rope was always real was always there\n the snake was an illusion that existed only in our mind\n in the same way walking in the darkness we may see a dead tree and mistake it for a human being taking its branches for arms\n we may even see the arms move and think we see a face looking at us\n but when we come closer we see it is only a tree and a dead one at that\n the tree was real but the man was not\n illusion is always a mental phenomenon never a real or objective thing\n so it is illusion and ignorance we must decry but never find fault with the world for the world is brahman\n in both instances rope and tree we may experience great fear\n but the moment we see them for what they really are our fear evaporates and we are at peace\n this is how it is with us and this world\n our illusions fill us with terrible fears and anxieties all of which will be dispelled when we see its actual nature as brahman\n no wonder then that krishna told arjuna even a little of this dharma delivers you from great fear\n bhagavad gita the chain of causation the sage now gives us an outline of the process of the emanation of the world from brahman\n brahman willed that it should be so and brought forth out of himself the material cause of the universe from this came the primal energy and from the primal energy mind from mind the subtle elements from the subtle elements the many worlds and from the acts performed by beings in the many worlds the chain of cause and effect the reward and punishment of works\n mundaka upanishad creation is also spoken of as expansions from brahman and that is the mode here\n brahman first expands as primordial matter than as primordial energy\n from this comes the intelligence inherent in creation then the elements and the various worlds in which they predominate\n the final ingredient yough comes from the sentient beings within the universe karma\n god supplies the stage and we supply the actions and reactions which unfold upon the stage\n brahman sees all knows all he is knowledge itself\n of him are born cosmic intelligence name form and the material cause of all created beings and things\n no wonder then that in the gita that great digest of the upanishads we find the words brahman is the ritual brahman is the offering brahman is he who offers to the fire that is brahman\n if a man sees brahman in every action he will find brahman\n bhagavad gita seeing is freeing\n delusion and ignorance we usually think of delusion and ignorance in terms of ordinary life and its situations\n those who are more occupied with spiritual matters assume that they are beyond such but angiras thinks differently and so should we\n finite and transient are the fruits of sacrificial rites\n the deluded who regard them as the highest good remain subject to birth and death\n swami prabhavananda has omitted verses to of this section as they enumerate various technical aspects of vedic sacrifices\n verse seven begins the philosophical exposition of the external rites\n swami nikhilananda translates a bit more literally frail indeed are those rafts of sacrifices therefore they are destructible\n fools who rejoice in them as the highest good fall victims again and again to old age and death\n back they must turn to the mortal pathway subject still to birth and to dying bhagavad gita says the gita on the same subject\n karma and religion i think just about everybody puts karma into two lumps good karma and bad karma\n but that is not very sait isfactory\n karma like all of life has many nuances and can vary greatly\n some karma for example creates more karma and some actually dissolves karma\n for example sri ramakrishna said that all spiritual practices are part of karma yoga but they deliver us from karma\n there are material mental and spiritual karmas\n the material and mental karmas impel us to more of the same whether good or bad\n but spiritual karma enables us to rise above the material and mental planes and free ourselves from karmic bondage\n angiras wants us to understand that religious karma is not always spiritual\n this should not surprise us when we can readily see that most religion is based on material goals\n stuff and happiness just about sums up the motives of all the religions of the world including that of modern india\n as a result most religious acts culminate in more mental and psychological involvement not freedom\n in the verses omitted by swami prabhavananda it is pointed out that most religion creates karma that takes us to heaven and then dumps us back on earth when our merit is used up\n so we end back where we started\n just because a religious act is either directed toward god or offered to god does not mean it will ultimately lead to god\n usually it leads us away from god into the labyrinth of relative existence in some form or other\n since most people have been cultivating a taste for earthly things through life after life this suits them\n but it should gall us and we should refuse the pursuit and get off the merry go round\n great suffering so there are aspects of religion we should avoid adamantly\n otherwise living in the abyss of ignorance yet wise in their own conceit the deluded go round and round like the blind led by the blind\n they be blind leaders of the blind\n and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch matthew said jesus surely having this verse in mind\n swami gambhirananda s translation points out a sad aspect of all this remaining within the fold of ignorance and thinking we are ourselves wise and learned the fools while being buffeted very much ramble about like the blind led by the blind alone\n being afflicted by many ills is the translation of swami nikhilananda\n promising others the cessation of all troubles and sorrows these religious mountebanks are more afflicted than ordinary people\n whether this is from the negative karma accruing from their dishonesty or a manifestation of their own inner diseases the result is the same\n while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption ii peter as saint peter put it\n you have better ways to spend your time so i will not recount to you the observations of over sixty years in which i have seen such hucksters and their dupes literally undergoing the sufferings of the damned\n and all the while they denounce those taking another path as deluded and of the devil\n well as jesus said they have their reward\n matthew and they must like it for they certainly cling to it\n such is the grave danger of externalized religion\n great delusion as i say they love and cling to their miserable condition\n as the upanishad continues living in the abyss of ignorance the deluded think themselves blest\n attached to works they know not god\n works lead them only to heaven whence to their sorrow their rewards quickly exhausted they are flung back to earth\n then the heart of the matter is revealed in the next verse considering religion to be observance of rituals and performance of acts of charity the deluded remain ignorant of the highest good\n having enjoyed in heaven the reward of their good works they enter again into the world of mortals\n rituals of worship and good deeds certainly produce good karma but that is not the force that lifts us above samsara the ever turning wheel of birth and death\n if our religion consists only of outer observances it will condition our consciousness even more to identify with the material level of existence\n and that identification will be a round trip ticket for our return to another birth after another death even helping others is spiritually valueless if it is not done with a wider spiritual perspective\n one of the hallmarks of today s ineffectual religion is its obsessive involvement in social action and reform\n when we look at the lives of saints we see they were the most generous of people even sacrificing themselves for others\n but they did these things not as their religion but as an expression of their love for god and his children which is the true religion\n we must not remain ignorant of the highest good but must seek that highest good within through meditation and the cultivation of spiritual consciousness even outside meditation\n unless we do this we will find ourselves shuttled right back to earth on completion of our good heaven karma\n wisdom and truth the wise no one likes to be yought stupid and all like to be yought intelligent\n even better is it to be yought wise\n of course in all ages there have been the fools that preferred to be cool or sharp or neat or such idiotic expressions\n the sad thing is that the vast majority want to be yought of as smart or wise but only a small percentage care whether they really are smart or wise\n the upanishad is meant for these latter people so the sage continues but wise self controlled and tranquil souls who are contented in spirit and who practice austerity and meditation in solitude and silence are freed from all impurity and attain by the path of liberation to the immortal the truly existing the changeless self\n let us look at the traits of the wise\n they are disciplined and so are self controlled\n as a result of their discipline they have become peaceful\n intent on spiritual development giving priority to the spirit they have become contented for outside the spirit there is no peace or tranquility\n this means that they are harmonious and balanced as well\n they continually engage in those disciplines which purify them and by being so purified they are capable of becoming adept in meditation\n as a result of these qualities they are firmly on the path to liberation and shall wiyout doubt attain to the self which is the only truly existing thing changeless and sure from eternity\n some adjectives now a look at some sanskrit terms will be helpful to us\n the wise are said to be aranye living in the forest\n at the time of the gita many serious sadhakas lived on the outskirts of towns preferring to live in the wooded areas where neighbors would not be visible even if somewhat near\n this ideal is found twice in the gita turn all your yought toward solitude spurning the noise of the crowd its fruitless commotion\n bhagavad gita and when a man seeks solitude ever engaged in his meditation on brahman that man is ready for oneness with brahman\n bhagavad gita it is not a matter of surrounding vegetation but the inward withdrawal from outer association that is being praised here\n even in a crowded city we can live in the forest of inner solitude\n in the thirteenth chapter of autobiography of a yogi the master yogi ram gopal muzumdar asked yogananda are you able to have a little room where you can close the door and be alone when he said that he did have such a room the saint told him that is your cave\n that is your sacred mountain\n that is where you will find the kingdom of god\n though that is so still the aspiring yogi should be extremely sparing of social contacts and then only with those who benefit him spiritually\n the first words of this verse in sanskrit describe the wise as tapahshraddhe an interesting fusion of tapasya and shraddha ascetic discipline and faith shraddha in this instance meaning aspiration more than faith\n many people engage in spiritual practice for the wrong reasons but the right one is a confidence in one s ability to attain self realization\n tapah literally means to generate heat so tapahshraddha can also mean heat generating faith or aspiration that which heats us up builds the proverbial fire under us gets us moving and keeps us moving\n tapasya is the energy generator of the wise directed by their assurance that the goal exists and is within grasp\n tapahshraddha is the radiance tejas that fills the proficient yogi\n in the chandogya upanishad when a young man returns from a long period of tapasya his teacher said to him my son your face shines like one who knows brahman\n chandogya upanishad this is the effect of tapahshraddha\n the wise are vidvamsah learned\n they not only practice they study and learn and assimilate what they have learned\n there is no place in spiritual life for pious ignorance\n sentimental dummies are not devotees they are fools\n and fools do not find god\n it is very true that many people get what yogananda called intellectual indigestion from reading loads of theories and trivia\n but the wise carefully choose books of spiritual wisdom such as scriptures lives of holy people and the writings teachings of those who possess genuine inner illumination\n such books can never do anything but good\n it is especially necessary to read the teachings of realized yogis\n i am not talking about super gurus glitter gurus and empire building gurus but real masters of the spiritual life\n naturally they will have to use their own good sense as to whose words are worthwhile and whose are worthless or even poisonous\n they will not have a library of yousands of books i assure you\n but they will have a goodly number of spiritual gems which they will perpetually read and ponder daily\n certainly they will not spend hours a day on reading but they will allot an appropriate amount of time for it\n fake teachers and cults hate what i have just written insisting that loyal and in tune culit ists will read nothing but what the cult authorizes so the dupes will not get confused\n this only reveals their predatory cruelty\n their protection of their sheep is nothing less than the protective custody of the nazi death camps\n they fear that if their followers become informed as to the real nature of traditional philosophy and yoga they will realize they are being lied to and will sensibly go elsewhere and find real truth\n and that is bad for business\n now comes an interesting adjective virajah beyond free from rajas\n this may seem odd but those of you who have been yogis for some years will remember how at the beginning of your yoga days you were very rajasic in your approach\n first of all you wanted to tell everyone about it and you went around accumulating spiritual stuff of all kinds\n you really began to star in your own spiritual movie and you made quite an epic\n your motives were perfectly all right even laudable but they were rajasic filled with activity and passion for getting on to the goal\n again the intentions were good but the feverishness and externalization was not\n for a lot of people when the rajas fizzles out so does their impetus toward god\n most abandon any form of spiritual life while others settle down to a comfortable and ineffectual life in some yoga cult that makes them feel secure and one of the chosen\n but what is needed is for the rajasic heat to mutate into the steady warmth and radiance of sattwa\n then the aspiration and involvement actually increases but in a fully effectual way an increasingly interior way\n spiritual life changes over from a compulsion to an intelligent choice\n spiritual restlessness becomes steadiness in spiritual practice and development\n god is no longer the brass ring to strain at but an everpresent reality whose perception keeps on increasing in a naturally supernatural way\n and the result of all this the upanishad says prayanti suryadvarena which shankara says means they move superbly skillfully along the path of the sun\n that is they ascend steadily and skillfully to the solar world the realm of the self existent light that is brahman\n getting in perspective many things are needed in life but none more important than an overview a perspective on the values of life\n this is true for everyone so the sage now speaks of it in a spiritual context\n let a man devoted to spiritual life examine carefully the ephemeral nature of such enjoyment whether here or hereafter as may be won by good works and so realize that it is not by works that one gains the eternal\n let him give no yought to transient things but absorbed in meditation let him renounce the world\n if he would know the eternal let him humbly approach a guru devoted to brahman and wellversed in the scriptures\n this needs to be looked at bit by bit\n let a man devoted to spiritual life examine carefully the ephemeral nature of such enjoyment whether here or hereafter as may be won by good works and so realize that it is not by works that one gains the eternal\n back in high school i came across an eighteenth century collection of humor and satire\n i have forgotten most of it but there was one story about a man who fell in love with a woman he often saw at the theater\n that was when all lighting came from candles and in that light she looked stunningly beautiful\n he got the courage to ask her if he could visit her at home in the daytime\n she agreed and in the daylight he saw that she was horrible looking incredibly old wore a wig and loads of make up\n he fell out of love instantly it is the same with this and all other worlds and the enjoyments they offer in return for good karma\n it is all deathly illusion\n what we need is the light of spiritual day\n seeing the world clearly is the only lasting antidote for the poison of worldliness\n first we approach the matter intellectually\n just the fact of inevitable death should begin to turn us from attachment and the fact that nothing lasts should seal our disillusionment\n yet old habits do indeed die hard and there is no habit as strongly entrenched as attraction to the world and its promises\n so discipline is needed\n let him give no yought to transient things\n the wise aspirant must exert his will and refuse to even give a yought to the good things offered by the world good things that will melt away in time and that often prove to be anything but good\n look at those that have worldly success\n misery and confusion is their daily bread but those who envy them are convinced that they alone have found the way to happiness\n we must in contrast refuse to even look at the mirages held out to us by the world and our own habit deluded mind\n how will we cure the mind of its awful addictions by being absorbed in meditation\n for meditation cures the fevers of the mind and heart and dispels the hallucinations produced by illusions and desires\n the only way to be absorbed in meditation is to be constantly cultivating interior consciousness even outside of meditation\n our whole life must become a meditation process\n let him renounce the world\n the sanskrit word nirvedam does not really mean renunciation yough many translators use that term\n actually nirvedam means being indifferent not being influenced or moved by something in this case the world and its ways\n it is an inner state a condition of the mind very akin to the non arising nirodha of mental reactions vrittih spoken about in the yoga sutras as being the state of yoga\n when your intellect has cleared itself of its delusions you will become indifferent to the results of all action present or future\n bhagavad gita and consequently you will be indifferent to the actions that produce those results as well as the world stage on which their dramas are enacted\n none of this occurs just for the asking or wishing so angiras give us practical advice if he would know the eternal let him humbly approach a guru devoted to brahman and well versed in the scriptures\n the ideal of the upanishads often differs from that of later indian yought which is not based on wisdom but on whimsy and often on theatrical effect\n today there is a lot of talk about how valueless a teacher is who only knows the scriptures but has no inner realization and how wonderful is the illiterate or one who is ignorant of the scriptures but who has spiritual knowledge\n first of all a scholar can tell you what the great masters of the spiritual life taught in the scriptures and you can learn from them just as you would if they were still on earth\n you cannot get spirituality from books it is true but you can get spiritual instruction that will lead to the acquisition of spirituality\n on the other hand what kind of a person supposedly intent on gaining spiritual knowledge will choose to remain ignorant consider sri ramana maharshi\n he had no interest in academic matters but after going to arunachala and attaining realization he became a living library of countless spiritual texts having read widely in several languages\n so the sage tells us that a woryour teacher has a thorough knowledge of the holy writings and is also brahmanishtham established in the experiential knowledge of brahman\n such a teacher is rare but we should accept no lesser teacher\n if we find such a one we must learn all we can and then apply it\n if we cannot find one then we should diligently study the words of realized masters and follow them\n the mahayana buddhists say a very wonderful thing whenever someone resolves to seek enlightenment a host of buddhas and bodhisattwas immediately become aware of it and begin blessing and guiding him\n real masters never die so we can become their disciples no matter how long ago they lived in a physical body\n this is especially true of three great masters who both teach and save even now krishna buddha and jesus\n one who sincerely with right intention takes refuge in them and prays for guidance will find they respond\n such a one will need to act on what he already knows if he hopes to gain further understanding\n and if he is wise he will assiduously avoid all those who claim to be their representatives or intermediaries\n to a disciple who approaches reverently who is tranquil and self controlled the wise teacher gives that knowledge faithfully and wiyout stint by which is known the truly existing the changeless self\n by these words we know the qualified student and the qualified teacher\n when the two come together the result is perfect knowing\n origin and return the imperishable is the real\n as sparks innumerable fly upward from a blazing fire so from the depths of the imperishable arise all things\n to the depths of the imperishable they in turn descend\n this is a spectacular simile mostly because it happens to be the absolute truth\n but a more literal translation brings out some important points prabhavananda decided to pass over\n here is swami nikhilananda s rendering as from a blazing fire sparks essentially akin to it fly forth by the yousand so also my good friend do various beings come forth from the imperishable brahman and unto him again return\n swami gambhirananda the saintly president of ramakrishna mission translated it this way as from a fire fully ablaze fly off sparks in their yousands that are akin to the fire similarly from the immutable originate different kinds of creatures and into it again they merge\n three prime truths there are three points being made here that are the bedrock of upanishadic philosophy\n first all beings that exist past present future are of the same nature even the same substance as brahman\n second all forms modes of existence yough ever changing proceed from the unchanging unchangeable\n this seeming contradiction is made possible by the illusory power of maya\n that is the changing forms are illusory while the essential being the self atman is unchanging\n third having come from brahman they shall all wiyout exception return to brahman\n when life is viewed this way we can understand its nature and purpose and live accordingly\n for the upanishads are not interested in giving us empty theory wiyout a practical application\n some traits of the source self luminous is that being and formless\n he dwells within all and wiyout all\n he is unborn pure greater than the greatest wiyout breath wiyout mind\n pervading all both brahman and the atman are yet untouched by any forms in which they dwell knowing themselves through themselves self luminous\n both the internal and the external are permeated with the presence of conscious spirit\n alyough the forms floating on the surface of the ocean of being are born conditioned endowed with mind and senses and compelled to live as a consequence of the sowing and reaping of karma in previous lives in reality none of this takes place in an absolute objective sense\n rather it is the power of maya that produces these appearances\n as the gita says helpless all for maya is their master \n bhagavad gita yet the sage is telling us in this upanishad that almighty as maya seems to be spirit is greater than the greatest\n when we are sunk in delusion then maya seems the most powerful but when we transfer our conscious into spirit then we find that the self is always the master of maya on the universal and the individual levels\n again brahman is the source from him are born breath mind the organs of sense ether air fire water and the earth and he binds all these together\n god s creation is never separated from him for an instant\n by his indwelling presence he maintains and unifies them\n all that exists is held in the mind of god for they are his youghts made visible or tangible\n heaven is his head the sun and moon his eyes the four quarters his ears the revealed scriptures his voice the air his breath the universe his heart\n from his feet came the earth\n he is the innermost self of all\n the universe is not really god s creation it is his manifestation his incarnation\n and he remains its inner controller antaryamin \n from him arises the sun illumined sky from the sky the rain from the rain food and from food the seed in man which he gives to woman\n thus do all creatures descend from him\n mundaka upanishad though this differs from her style of expression it reminds me of great wisdom spoken by mary baker eddy the founder of christian science\n she said that in reality we all come from god but we ignore the fact\n we say everybody in my family gets and then name some disease or negative condition\n we think it is genetics that must manifest\n but our real genes are divine qualities\n why do we not believe they will manifest in us our father and mother were adult human beings and we became the same\n the ultimate father mother is god so why do we neglect the development of divine consciousness divinity is our only true nature\n from him are born hymns devotional chants scriptures rites sacrifices oblations divisions of time the doer and the deed and all the worlds lighted by the sun and purified by the moon\n mundaka upanishad you cannot get more complete than that from him are born gods of diverse descent\n from him are born angels men beasts birds from him vitality and food to sustain it from him austerity and meditation faith truth continence and law\n it is this last part that is of special meaning for us\n we are told that austerity tapasya meditation faith truth continence and law arise from god\n they are the presence of god manifesting in our life and through us to the world\n who then can be more beneficial to the world than a yogi the word vidhi translated law means both instruction and method\n there is an innate order in the universe which each of us should embody\n it is not learned intellectually but is intuited by the yogi\n the yogi will then order his life accordingly methodically\n of course the supreme method is the method of meditation itself\n from him spring the organs of sense their activities and their objects together with their awareness of these objects\n all these things parts of man s nature spring from him\n this explains how human beings are made in the image of god\n in him the seas and the mountains have their source from him spring the rivers and from him the herbs and other life sustaining elements by the aid of which the subtle body of man subsists in the physical body\n thus brahman is all in all\n he is action knowledge goodness supreme\n to know him hidden in the lotus of the heart is to untie the knot of ignorance\n knowing god about god further description of brahman is now to be given along with instructions on how to know brahman\n the upanishad is so clear and the concepts have been referred to before so some verses hardly need more than a sentence of comment\n self luminous is brahman ever present in the hearts of all\n he is the refuge of all he is the supreme goal\n in him exists all that moves and breathes\n in him exists all that is\n he is both that which is gross and that which is subtle\n beyond the ken of the senses is he\n attain you him the last part is the most important\n what value is it to know about god if we do not go to god saint silouan of athos used to say that theology is the false mysticism of the ego for people become sait isfied or even fascinated with philosophical concepts that are nothing but bare words\n rare are those who want to experience the things they believe\n in many instances it may be that people intuit the untruth of their religious beliefs and subconsciously know that they cannot be experienced\n but it is sad to see those that have come to understand the concepts of karma reincarnation and evolution of consciousness still dawdling along with the theorists instead of getting on to the goal\n he the self luminous subtler than the subtlest in whom exist all the worlds and all those that live therein he is the imperishable brahman\n he is the principle of life\n he is speech and he is mind\n attain him o my friend the one goal to be attained not only must we attain god we must understand while striving that he is the only goal to be attained for everything else is antithetical to our eternal nature\n the means to reach god having hopefully convinced us of the value of seeking god the sage is going to tell us how to find god by telling us the actual means affix to the upanishad the bow incomparable the sharp arrow of devotional worship then with mind absorbed and heart melted in love draw the arrow and hit the mark the imperishable brahman\n om is the bow the arrow is the individual being and brahman is the target\n with a tranquil heart take aim\n lose yourself in him even as the arrow is lost in the target\n here is swami gambhirananda s more literal version taking hold of the bow that is the great weapon familiar in the upanishads one should fix on it an arrow sharpened with meditation\n drawing the string with a mind absorbed in its yought hit that very target that is the immutable\n om is the bow the soul atma is the arrow and brahman is called its target\n it is to be hit by an unerring man\n one should become one with it just like an arrow\n this is really a description of meditation so each point is significant\n taking hold of the bow om is the bow \n right away we are being given a most valuable instruction in meditation\n we take hold of om by intoning it within\n our practice must not be passive but calmly active we are always to be in charge by taking hold of om and applying it in meditation through the generation of subtle sound\n see om yoga its theory and practice\n the active character of om is indicated by its being called a bow for a bow impels the arrow to its target\n it is a matter of strength of power\n in the rig veda we find the gayatri mantra a great prayer for enlightenment we meditate on the spiritual effulgence of that supreme divine reality\n may that impel us toward it\n om is the force that impels us toward divinity\n that is the great weapon familiar in the upanishads\n om is not just a weapon among many it is the great weapon for conquering ignorance that is referred to throughout the upanishads\n this is not a matter of opinion or discussion\n in the eleven basic upanishads the gita and the yoga sutras the only mantra recommended is om and the only meditation set forth is the meditation on om\n an honest perusal of these texts will reveal that this is neither an exaggeration nor a wishful interpretation\n alyough the wisdom of these sacred texts has been almost totally ignored for past centuries their truth is not to be denied by any who ascribe to sanatana dharma\n it is departing from the upanishadic philosophy that has resulted in the confused mess of contemporary hinduism the worst of it aspects being the treacherous and destructive idolatry of gurudom\n because of this aberration people have accepted a myriad substitutes for the upanishadic truth on the basis of guru bhakti and faith in the guru\n the resulting confusion is obvious to those not drowning in it themselves\n one should fix on it an arrow sharpened with meditation the self is the arrow \n our very self our very consciousness is to be united with om in calm and whole hearted attention\n this can only be done by being purified by constant meditation according to shankara s commentary\n so meditation is itself the way to become proficient in meditation\n the simple fact that we are meditating is assurance that we shall become more and more proficient in it\n when that proficiency is gained then we will easily unite our consciousness with om\n drawing the string with a mind absorbed in its yought\n through constant meditation we develop the ability to fill our awareness with the inner intonations of om which act like the string of a bow to the mind that is fixed on it\n hit that very target that is the immutable brahman \n we do not start out small and work up to bigger things\n from the first we aim at brahman\n by means of this determination brahman alone will be realized by us wiyout wandering into the psychic byways that can confuse and delude the wandering meditator who does not know the method of the upanishads\n it is to be hit by an unerring man\n the idea here is that the one who can successfully hit the target of brahman is one who has no distractions or waverings whose mind remains firmly established in the japa and meditation of om\n there is a kind of parable about this in the mahabharata\n in yoga as a universal science swami krishnananda tells it this way those who are familiar with the mahabharata know the story of the tournament arranged by acharya drona for the pandavas and the kauravas\n the test of concentration which dronacharya arranged for those boys was like this\n there was a tree with many branches\n in one fine twig he hung a wooden bird\n the eye of the bird was looking like a black spot and that eye was to be shot by the arrow\n so he asked the boys concentrate yourself on the eye of that bird and hit it\n look what do you see well one said well i see a bird sitting on the tree\n dronacharya said you are unfit\n you are not able to concentrate\n then he asked another what do you see i see the bird sitting on the branch\n no you are not able to concentrate\n then he asked yudhishthira what do you see i see only the eye\n no good he said\n arjuna said i see only the black spot\n i see nothing else\n yes you are the man said dronacharya hit it arjuna s concentration was so intense that he could see only the black spot\n he could not see even the eye of the bird there let alone the bird and the tree and the people around\n and that must be us\n it may take time but it nonetheless must come about\n one should become one with it just like an arrow\n the arrow embeds itself in the target and becomes one with it\n this is not an occasional ascent to higher awareness but a permanent establishment in the being of brahman\n it is meditation on om that can accomplish this\n what we will perceive in that union as a result of our meditation we shall directly perceive in him are woven heaven earth and sky together with the mind and all the senses\n know him the self alone\n give up vain talk\n he is the bridge of immortality\n this verse actually refers to om and literally says on that om are strung heaven earth space the mind and all the senses\n it alone is the sole support of all\n having known the self through om discard other speech or mantras and their results\n for this om is the bridge to immortality\n that is a bit different om is the all encompassing reality from which all things have come\n it alone leads us back to immortality\n om should be our continual and in meditation our only yought insofar as it is possible and practical\n where we find god oh that i knew where i might find him that i might come even to his seat job lamented the biblical job\n if he had access to the upanishads as we do he would have found the answer in the next verse within the lotus of the heart he dwells where like the spokes of a wheel in its hub the nerves meet\n meditate on him as om\n easily mayest you cross the sea of darkness\n gambhirananda with that hub in which are fixed the nerves nadis like the spokes on the hub of a chariot wheel moves this aforesaid self by becoming multiformed\n meditate on the self thus with the help of om\n my you be free from hindrances in going to the other shore beyond darkness\n at the core of all our manifest existence there moves the immortal spirit self which has assumed all the forms and aspects we call us\n alyough these numberless veils hide the self from our present vision we can meditate on it by the means of om\n this will remove all obstacles and carry us safely over the heaving waves of samsara into the harbor of spirit\n as patanjali says regarding om its constant repetition and meditation is the way\n from it result the disappearance of obstacles and the turning inward of consciousness\n the same thing is said in the varaha and yoga tattwa b upanishads\n more about the heart when the upanishads speak of the heart they do not mean the physical organ that pumps blood but the center of our being where the self ever dwells\n the sage now speaks more about this spiritual heart\n this self who understands all who knows all and whose glory is manifest in the universe lives within the lotus of the heart the bright throne of brahman\n by the pure in heart is he known\n the self exists in man within the lotus of the heart and is the master of his life and of his body\n with mind illumined by the power of meditation the wise know him the blissful the immortal\n mundaka upanishad there is a great deal to learn from this verse\n since the self understands and knows all to be truly knowledgous and wise all we need do is shift our awareness into our own self\n alyough the self should not be identified with external things such as our body or the world nevertheless the glory of our self including the supreme self is manifested in our own private universe and the greater universe as well\n we can come to perceive spiritual realities hidden within the material illusions\n the self abides in the core of our being not in the physical heart\n according to the great yogis we can speak of the yousand petalled lotus of the brain as our spiritual heart especially the very core of the brain the cave like area within which the pineal gland is located\n this is sometimes called the chidakasha the space of consciousness\n both god and the individual self dwell there\n in the sanskrit text there is the expression brahmapuri the city of god used for this spiritual heart\n it further says that god and the self are known by centering our awareness in this heart\n it is meditation which illumines the mind and enables us to see and know this blissful immortal self all around us in everything\n this is living the knot of the heart which is ignorance is loosed all doubts are dissolved all evil effects of deeds are destroyed when he who is both personal and impersonal is realized\n when we enter into the consciousness of our individual spirit and the infinite spirit the blinding veil of ignorance will dissolve away along with all the bonds of karma\n in the effulgent lotus of the heart dwells brahman who is passionless and indivisible\n he is pure he is the light of lights\n him the knowers of the self attain\n what greater goal can we have than this the light of lights in summation of this section the sage says him the sun does not illumine nor the moon nor the stars nor the lightning nor verily fires kindled upon the earth\n he is the one light that gives light to all\n he shining everything shines\n this immortal brahman is before this immortal brahman is behind this immortal brahman extends to the right and to the left above and below\n verily all is brahman and brahman is supreme\n mundaka upanishad these thrilling words need no comment only response\n the two selves cross eyed people see a single object as two\n in the same way the ignorant see the one as many\n yet there is a perverse spiritual cross eyedness which works just the opposite making its victims see two as one\n this is the disease of half baked vedanta that is merely conceptual and not based on the experience that only yoga imparts\n there is no such thing as a genuine vedanit ist who is not first and foremost a yogi\n anyway the upanishad is now going to give us the right understanding of the paramatman and the jivatman the supreme self and the individual self their unity and their distinction and their relationship with each other\n here too only the yogi will really understand what is being said\n like two birds of golden plumage inseparable companions the individual self and the immortal self are perched on the branches of the selfsame tree\n the former tastes of the sweet and bitter fruits of the tree the latter tasting of neither calmly observes\n this is a case where the sanskrit original gives very precise information which is necessary for us to carefully peruse\n otherwise we will miss some remarkable truths\n three qualities this verse gives us three words in relation to the two birds the two selves suparna sayuja and sakhaya\n suparna means intimately related the idea being that the individual self and the cosmic self exist in an eternal relation\n sayuja means being in a state of union perpetual union as shankara points out in his commentary\n a secondary meaning of sayuja is being in the same place that the two selves are inseparable are ever present to one another\n according to shankara the third expression sakhaya means that the two selves have the identical name or designation and exists in an identical manner\n the upanishads say that om is the name or designator of them both and that they possess the same qualities one in an absolute degree and the other in a limited degree\n sakhaya also means companionship and friendship indicating the deep personal relation between the jivatman and paramatman\n the selfsame tree is the body and by extension the cosmos\n the form of every sentient being has two indwellers the two selves\n however they do not have the same experience of the tree\n the individual the jiva tastes the fruit of the tree in the form of the inner and outer senses and according to the quality of that experience is made happy unhappy contented discontented and so forth\n the individual undergoes experience\n the supreme self on the other hand tasting of neither sweet or bitter experiences calmly observes\n god experiences being in all forms and is aware of all that the individual spirit experiences yet as a more literal translation says he looks on wiyout eating wiyout being affected or conditioned by it\n but he does know exactly the effect and conditioning that accrues to the individual self\n he is experiencing right along with us but unlike us is not pulled into a mistaken identity with the body mind and its experiences\n the problem and the solution on the other hand the individual self deluded by forgetfulness of his identity with the divine self bewildered by his ego grieves and is sad\n but when he recognizes the worshipful lord as his own true self and beholds his glory he grieves no more\n this is quite interpretive yough correctly so\n the literal translation of swami gambhirananda is on the same tree the individual soul remains drowned as it were and so it moans being worried by its impotence\n when it sees thus the other the adored lord and his glory then it becomes liberated from sorrow\n we are drowned submerged in the deadly ocean of samsara of continual birth death unsurety pain and confusion\n shankara points out that the individual is overwhelmed with confusion because it cannot understand what is really happening to it and why\n just like a piece of driftwood on the heaving sea it is lifted up and down thrown onto the shore and then pulled out to sea again\n so it grieves at its helplessness and hopelessness\n all is changed yough when the individual sees right in the core of its being the very god it has been hitherto worshipping as separate from itself\n experiencing within its own being the presence and the glory of god and thereby realizing that glory as his own the individual becomes liberated from sorrow\n the sage elaborates on this continuing when the seer beholds the effulgent one the lord the supreme being then transcending both good and evil and freed from impurities he unites himself with him\n more literally when the seer sees the purusha self effulgent creator lord and source of all relative existence then the illumined one completely shakes off both virtue and vice becomes taintless and attains absolute equality non duality \n that is the jiva recognizes that shiva the absolute is its true nature\n then no longer bound by do and don t it is able to act according to its essential being\n not that morality will be abandoned but that there will be no more need to think it should or should not do something\n rather it will do the right and the perfect spontaneously naturally as a consequence of its rediscovered divinity\n for it will be free from all bonds or compulsions whatever\n this is because in the divine vision it has become free from all defects or blemish\n but most important is the trait that is listed last paramam samyam supreme sameness literally but the meaning is absolute unity and therefore absolute identify with the absolute itself\n since the two are really one the upanishad continues describing both the individual and the infinite selves as they partake of one another s traits\n the lord is the one life shining forth from every creature\n seeing him present in all the wise man is humble puts not himself forward\n his delight is in the self his joy is in the self he serves the lord in all\n such as he indeed are the true knowers of brahman\n how to do it anyone who ponders these astounding words with intelligence will be eager to attain brahman so the sage tells how that is done\n this effulgent self is to be realized within the lotus of the heart by continence by steadfastness in truth by meditation and by superconscious vision\n their impurities washed away the seers realize him\n this is quite clear but some precise terms should be considered to put a fine point on the message of this verse\n swami gambhirananda renders it the bright and pure self within the body that the monks with attenuated blemishes see is attainable through truth concentration complete knowledge and continence practiced constantly\n the self within the body\n the self is within the body therefore it is absurd to disdain the body and even more absurd to engage in a meditation practice that ignores the body and the necessity for its purification and spiritual empowerment\n just forgetting about the material side of things and flying off into pure spirit is an appealing idea the problem is it is mistaken and can never work\n however long or short a journey it always begins right from the point where we are\n and at this point we are not only in the body we are tied into it by a multitude of bonds bonds that must be dissolved\n our yoga practice must cover this situation\n the prime implication yough is that since the self is right here in the body it is not far away\n we need not even seek it just see it\n the word rather poorly translated as monk is yati which actually means a wanderer\n this is because in the ancient times in india the wandering ascetics who moved about teaching dharma were given this title\n they were not monks or sannyasis in the later sense\n obviously they were not married as their mode of life prevented that and their life was dedicated to spiritual discipline and teaching\n nevertheless they were not considered outside society as the sadhu is today in india\n they were simply those who sacrificed personal life to serve others\n it was a noble way of life but not a separation\n the original christian ascetics were just the same\n they wore ordinary clothes and were considered christian laity\n the only distinctive thing about them was their way of life\n the men usually lived on the edge of towns usually as hermits\n the women lived together in houses within the town for mutual protection\n in the eyes of everyone they were pious bachelors and spinsters not at all distinct from other christians in an official sense\n all right that is the historical background but what is the meaning for us today no matter where we might live or how we must all be wanderers in the spirit aware with both saint paul and saint peter that we are strangers and pilgrims on the earth\n hebrews i peter \n jesus told someone the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head\n matthew this is actually the truth about every single sentient being on the earth there is no place where we can come to rest and be at home for our nature is spirit and our home is infinity\n so the yait is spoken of here are those who have become rootless in relation to this world\n or more to the point those who have recognized that they have no roots in the world only in god\n the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world\n galatians and so in their hearts they are always on pilgrimage back to the source aware that wherever they may be it is only a temporary accommodation on the long journey home to brahman\n the upanishad has a very informative expression kshinadoshah those whose mental defects such as anger etc\n have become significantly lessened\n eventually they will be totally eliminated but even now such persons are capable of the beginning stages of knowing the self\n this is important because we tend to think that until we are absolutely perfect we cannot know either god or our self\n this is not so\n just as the sky becomes lightened even before the sun appears above the horizon so it is with those yogis who earnestly strive for realization\n the elementary stages of enlightenment dawn for them\n samyag jnanena complete insight into the nature of the self both intellectually and intuitively also enables us to begin experiencing the realities of the self\n of course this cannot occur outside of yoga practice that is disciplined and steady\n some translators think this word nityam perpetual refers to continence brahmaacharya but others think it refers to constant and uninterrupted observance of all the virtues and practices listed in this verse\n that is logical because a break in any of these will set back the sadhaka to a significant degree and in some cases can destroy the possibility of his continuance in sadhana by turning his mind away from the real to the unreal\n this is however particularly true about brahmaacharya as is seen over and over\n in autobiography of a yogi yogananda relates this sad but telling incident a year later after entering the ashram kumar set out for a visit to his childhood home\n he ignored the quiet disapproval of sri yukteswar who never authoritatively controlled his disciples movements\n on the boy s return to serampore in a few months a change was unpleasantly apparent\n gone was the stately kumar with serenely glowing face\n only an undistinguished peasant stood before us one who had lately acquired a number of evil habits\n master summoned me and brokenheartedly discussed the fact that the boy was now unsuited to the monastic hermitage life\n mukunda i will leave it to you to instruct kumar to leave the ashram tomorrow i can t do it tears stood in sri yukteswar s eyes but he controlled himself quickly\n the boy would never have fallen to these depths had he listened to me and not gone away to mix with undesirable companions\n he has rejected my protection the callous world must be his guru still\n this narrative is particularly ironic since kumar means a young male virgin\n now all this is extremely to the point with no fudging under the guise of diplomacy or moderation\n perhaps that is why the sage then says to us truth alone succeeds not untruth\n by truthfulness the path of felicity is opened up the path which is taken by the sages freed from cravings and which leads them to truth s eternal abode\n once again swami gambhirananda helps us understand truth alone wins and not untruth\n by truth is maintained for ever the path called devayana by which the desireless seers ascend to where exists the supreme treasure attainable through truth\n sri ramakrishna often said that god is realized if one holds fast to truth\n if there is no strictness in observing truth everything is gradually lost\n as this upanishad says satyam eva jayate truth alone triumphs both in material and in spiritual life\n the path to liberation devayana the path of the shining ones is opened through truth\n truth in this context has a much higher and wider meaning than mere accuracy or honesty in speech\n it means to be a living embodiment of the truth of our self nature and eventually to be a virtual incarnation of the realized truth god the supreme treasure attainable through truth\n the god within the sage wiyout god brahman is supreme he is self luminous he is beyond all yought\n subtler than the subtlest is he farther than the farthest nearer than the nearest\n he resides in the lotus of the heart of every being\n this is the great mystery of the divine\n it is subtle beyond subtlety yet exists equally in the most tangible\n god is utterly beyond us and yet nearer to us than can be expressed\n this latter fact is a foundation stone of spiritual life\n the more we can turn inward the deeper we can penetrate into our own essential being the closer we will come to god\n yoga is an absolute necessity\n though prabhavananda uses the expression lotus of the heart the sanskrit text has guhayam in the cave referring to the absolute core of our being\n the eyes do not see him speech cannot utter him the senses cannot reach him\n he is to be attained neither by austerity nor by sacrificial rites\n when through discrimination the heart has become pure then in meditation the impersonal self is revealed\n no action or feeling or ideas can reveal god to us\n but when the heart has become purified by the spiritual insight that only meditation can produce then in meditation itself god is revealed\n for the subtle self within the living and breathing body is realized in that pure consciousness wherein is no duality that consciousness by which the heart beats and the senses perform their office\n mundaka upanishad meditation is the beginning middle and end of spiritual life\n there is a remarkable statement made here that the same consciousness which even now causes the body senses and mind to function is the same consciousness in which the divine vision takes place\n so we need not try to turn ourselves into something other than what we are\n we need only use it to free ourselves into spirit\n for that which binds also frees\n this is the unique understanding of the ancient sages in india an understanding needed by the whole world\n the sage the west may have no history of such great wisdom but we have a little platitude that can say much the proof of the pudding is in the eating\n as yogis we should keep this principle ever in mind\n the results of our yoga practice reveal its character relevance and value\n the yogi should be thoroughly pragmatic\n what is this doing for me should be the constant inquiry regarding his sadhana\n that this is not inappropriate is shown by the last verse in this section whether of heaven or of heavenly enjoyments whether of desires or of objects of desire whatever yought arises in the heart of the sage is fulfilled\n therefore let him who seeks his own good revere and worship the sage\n mundaka upanishad this tells us two things\n first whatever the liberated sage thinks of wills or desires that comes about\n examples of this are given in autobiography of a yogi and manifested all through yogananda s life especially toward its end as seen in paramahansa yogananda in memoriam the life of sri ramakrishna also demonstrates this\n second those that seek their highest good self realization should reverence and honor the atmajnam the one who knows the self\n this is very important\n the upanishad is not counseling us to make a god of a master or to substitute a brahmajnani for god\n when we want to learn something we go to an expert\n in the same way those seeking the knowledge of god should seek out the teachings of great masters of past and present\n if very fortunate the seeker will meet such a person in the flesh and have personal interchange with him\n the mere presence of such a great soul can transform our thinking and awaken our consciousness\n if we follow the instructions of an enlightened person regarding our inner development we will come to the exact same state of consciousness revealed in him\n remember true masters never die\n they can bless and guide those who approach them in their hearts\n often this is sufficient for the seeker and can be much safer than following a physically embodied teacher for often sentimentality and emotional projection completely blind the seeker to the reality unreality of the teacher\n i personally knew gurus whose presence was stunning even supernatural but after their physical death they vanished from the earth plane leaving their followers empty\n but i also knew teachers who became more intimately present to seekers after their physical form had departed proving themselves to truly be one with the immortal and omnipresent\n those who meditate can attune themselves to such masters and benefit from their very real presence\n how can we tell a true master a true master keeps pointing their students away from themselves to god the only goal\n and a true disciple is one who goes to god instead of making an idol or feit ish of the guru\n anyone silly enough can be a brainwashed groupie but the wise heed the teacher s message and go on to god\n as buddha said a woryour teacher or teaching is like a finger pointing at the moon\n the idea is to see the moon not the finger\n nevertheless the sage can be a very meaningful factor in our spiritual life so the upanishad continues with more information for us\n the sage knows brahman the support of all the pure effulgent being in whom is contained the universe\n they who worship the sage and do so wiyout yought of self cross the boundary of birth and death\n here are two more principles a sage is one who knows brahman in the absolute sense and those who honor them wiyout any personal desire for benefit or gain from them will break the ties of earthly rebirth\n this second part gives us a picture of real disciples or students who will attain spiritual benefit from a teacher they have no egocentric or personal desire coloring the way they relate to the teacher\n their only interest is in the self\n they are not looking for a teacher to give them power or a reputation for having the best guru glory through association is of no interest to them\n nor are they wanting the guru to become a substitute for an unsait isfactory parent friend spouse or lover\n they do not want a personal relationship with the guru to either possess the guru or be possessed by the guru\n they are not looking for some kind of fulfillment in a relationship with the teacher but only fulfillment in the self\n swami bimalananda a disciple of paramhansa yogananda once told us in a conversation that those who lived in the ashram headquarters of self realization fellowship just for the personality of yogananda eventually left the spiritual life as well as the ashram but those who came for god remained steadfast in both\n i think we can conclude that real disciples are as rare as real gurus the upanishad is not talking to spiritual fool arounds but to the woryour those who wish in the actual words of the upanishad to transcend the seed of human birth the ego\n two kinds of seekers since the sage angiras has put so much emphasis on the value of approaching and reverencing a master teacher he now digresses a bit to point out what makes the student succeed or fail in spiritual life\n he who brooding upon sense objects comes to yearn for them is born here and there again and again driven by his desire\n but he who has realized the self and thus sait isfied all hunger attains to liberation even in this life\n the sanskrit implies that those in the grip of desire are born where the objects of desire are to be found and bring the desire for them along\n it does not say that the objects are obtained however and we see that this is a continual torment for human beings wanting something but not able to get it\n to be in such a situation will only condition the mind more and more toward grasping at the things desired\n after who knows how long the object is then gotten and either lost or in danger of loss or proves to be disappointing or misery producing\n such is the dilemma of those who desire\n there is no use asking silly questions like how do i kill desire or how do i get rid of the ego you do not kill desire or discard the ego for that is a negative approach that by its nature will not work\n rather you take the positive approach i shall realize the self\n for realization of the self alone can quench all desire and dissolve the ego\n until then we ignore the clamor of desires disregard the demands of the ego and single mindedly go after the self\n along the way the desires will begin dropping away of themselves and the ego starved of attention will become less and less until desires and ego are simply gone forever\n it may not be easy but it is marvelously simple\n the self is not to be known through study of the scriptures nor through subtlety of the intellect nor through much learning\n but by him who longs for him is he known\n verily unto him does the self reveal his true being\n anyone who has travelled this far through the upanishads is very well acquainted with the fact that the self is not to be known through the usual avenues of human knowledge\n what is striking is the literal meaning of the next phrase by the very fact that he the aspirant seeks for it does it become attainable\n elsewhere i have mentioned that sri ma anandamayi often said the desire for god is the way to god meaning that the desire would prompt us to action not just mere wishing\n no one seeks for god who is not already able to find god for it is the very nearness of god that prompts his seeking\n seeking god is a guarantee a symptom of sure attainment\n it is also the thing which enables the self to reveal itself to him\n the self is not to be known by the weak nor by the youghtless nor by those who do not rightly meditate\n but by the rightly meditative the youghtful and the strong he is fully known\n mundaka upanishad too many meanings are being missed by this translation\n here it is literally this self is not attained by one devoid of strength nor through delusion produced by false experience nor through tapasya devoid of corresponding externals\n but the self of the man of knowledge who strives with diligence through these means strength clarity of sight and mind and a life ordered in conformity to tapasya enters the abode of brahman\n there is a lot to think over here\n the plain truths those devoid of the strength imparted by the strict observance of yama and niyama cannot possibly know the self\n both yama and niyama should be listed here for our most serious consideration\n yama restraint consists of ahimsa non violence non injury harmlessness satya truthfulness honesty i\n non lying asteya non stealing honesty non misappropriativeness brahmaacharya sexual continence and control of all the senses and aparigraha non possessiveness non greed nonselfishness non acquisitiveness \n niyama observance consists of shaucha purity cleanliness santosha contentment peacefulness tapas austerity practical i\n result producing spiritual discipline swadhyaya self study spiritual study and ishwarapranidhana offering of one s life to god \n a great deal of people including yogis are simply deluded mostly because they follow false teachings and teachers whose errors actively harm them or cause them to stagnate spiritually\n no matter how dedicated they may be or even how disciplined they cannot know the self because their intellects are confused and distorted especially by their aberrant meditation practices\n lucky are those yoga duds who merely vegetate\n but neither reach the goal\n it is utterly useless to engage in meditation wiyout making the life correspond to the sole purpose of meditation liberation of the spirit\n yoga has been propagated here in the west for a little over a hundred years and see how little good and how much devastation and delusion has resulted\n the reason is supremely simple yama and niyama are not followed and in many instances the fake gurus actually tell their dupes that yama and niyama are unnecessary\n i cannot calculate how many tangledminded yogis have boasted to me that they do not need to be vegetarians\n if a survey is taken of almost any yoga group over half will be living together in a relationship wiyout being married and those who are married have no idea of the need for brahmaacharya in marriage except for the conception of children and even then not unrestrained\n sri ramakrishna said that after the birth of two children the parents should live in chastity\n in my commentary on the gita i wrote the following that is most relevant here the dharma shastras which describe the correct life of non monastics are quite explicit about the need for husband and wife to lead lives of continence\n see how the yogi parents of paramhansa yogananda lived it as presented in autobiography of a yogi\n in the very first chapter we find mother made a remarkable admission to my eldest sister roma your father and myself live together as man and wife only once a year for the purpose of having children\n the fact that yogananda a devoted son and a pure hearted yogi would reveal this to the world in the pages of a book show how necessary he felt it was for both eastern and western readers to be shown the standard of chastity that yogis should observe in their life not using their non monastic status as excuse for lesser behavior\n he underlined this later in the forty fourth chapter giving these words written to mahatma gandhi by his wife kasturbai i thank you for the most perfect marriage in the world based on brahmaacharya and not on sex\n please note that these are examples of married yogis not monks imposing their ideas on others\n also remember that the guru of yogananda s parents was himself a married yogi so there is no monastic influence in their case\n i really have no hope that the foregoing will provoke anything but anger and resentment but it still has to be said in case some do want to reach the goal whatever the price\n the other aspects of yama and niyama are also important but these two shoals have wrecked many a yogi of east and west\n but the self of the man of knowledge who strives with diligence through these means strength clarity of sight and mind and a life ordered in conformity to tapasya enters the abode of brahman\n hail to the sages having known the self the sages are filled with joy\n blessed are they tranquil of mind free from passion\n realizing everywhere the all pervading brahman deeply absorbed in contemplation of his being they enter into him the self of all\n what an inspiring description\n these are the things that should motivate us not such cheap things as promises of heaven and threats of hell or bribes of good things and power\n to at last be ourselves as we really are to end all struggle with unreality and ignorance this is the woryour aim\n the only woryour prayer is that of jesus o father glorify you me with yours own self with the glory which i had with you before the world was\n john how to become a sage how do the sages get that way having fully ascertained and realized the truth of vedanta having established themselves in purity of conduct by following the yoga of renunciation these great ones attain to immortality in this very life and when their bodies fall away from them at death they attain to liberation\n having fully ascertained and realized the truth of vedanta\n first the vedantic truths the teachings found in the upanishads are carefully read and pondered\n but this is not enough in fact it is worthless unless they go on to realize those truths through meditation for it is this realization which is of supreme value and the wise diligently seek it\n having established themselves in purity of conduct\n not wanting empty theory the wise understand that their lives must be disciplined for the purification of their outer actions and inner consciousness\n moreover they ground themselves immovably in that purity\n following the yoga of renunciation\n since neither angiras or his students were monks it is mistaken to interpret sannyasa yoga as monastic life\n rather it is the inner discipline of detachment from all externals sannyasa while fixing the mind on the eternal yoga \n immortality in this very life\n those who follow this path of the sages will realize their nature as immortality itself\n they will not attain it they will recover and manifest it\n nor will this happen in some vague heavenly realm but right here and now\n at death they attain to liberation\n for them there is no longer any need for future birth in the material plane\n as the buddhist texts say birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done\n there is nothing further for this world\n but they are not just liberated from the earth they are liberated from all worlds and enter the real as their eternal abode\n the liberation process when death overtakes the body the vital energy enters the cosmic source the senses dissolve in their cause and karmas and the individual soul are lost in brahman the pure the changeless\n as rivers flow into the sea and in so doing lose name and form even so the wise man freed from name and form attains the supreme being the self luminous the infinite\n there are two aspects to these verses what is shed by the sage and what he merges with in liberation\n at the time of death the various bodies no longer retain their configuration\n since they are no longer needed for future incarnations they resolve back into the elements from which they came\n even the karmic forces now unnecessary melt away into basic energy along with the subtle bodies that created and embodied them\n what remains brahman and their atman self\n since these are really the source of all the foregoing in reality nothing whatever is lost only the conditioning dreams that held them in false bondage for so long\n finitude is traded for infinity blessed bargain he who knows brahman becomes brahman\n no one ignorant of brahman is ever born in his family\n he passes beyond all sorrow\n freed from the fetters of ignorance he becomes immortal\n who should learn this let the truth of brahman be taught only to those who obey his law who are devoted to him and who are pure in heart\n to the impure let it never be taught\n in india everyone knows the basic principles of brahmavidya\n the sage is not recommending secrecy but warning us away from wasting our time with people who are wilfully disqualifying themselves for spiritual life\n so who are qualified adhikari to receive detailed instruction in the eternal truths here is a much more literal and complete translation of the verse with some very interesting symbols to them alone should one expound this knowledge of brahman who are engaged in the practice of purificatory disciplines versed in the vedas and devoted to brahman who personally sacrifice to the fire called ekarshi with faith and by whom has been duly accomplished the vow of holding fire on the head\n engaged in the practice of purificatory disciplines\n the word translated by this phrase is kriyavantah which means those who are engaged in the practice of kriyas\n in the broad sense a kriya is any practice that entails doing something because the root of kriya is kri which means i do\n any practice exercise rite or even movement can be called a kriya\n usually yough kriya means a yogic practice or method which purifies the body and nervous system as well as the subtle bodies to enable the yogi to reach and hold on to higher levels of consciousness and being\n only those who are perpetually engaged in such practices need even hear about those states and their meaning\n for to anyone else it is mere theory which can easily be misunderstood by those who have no practical yogic experience\n versed in the scriptures\n the word shrotriyah means one who both knows the scriptures and the disciplines and practices they enjoin\n alyough mere scriptural knowledge is of little value it is necessary to know the teachings of the upanishads and the bhagavad gita in order to retain a right perspective in spiritual life\n buddha said that a seeker for enlightenment must be sure to follow the teachings of the liberated ones that have gone before\n a great deal of problems in spiritual life will be avoided if the upanishads and gita are studied daily and applied in their entirety\n shankara says that the brahmanishthah are those devoted to brahman as manifested in the cosmos yet who are actively seeking to know the transcendent brahman beyond the cosmos\n in other words the prevailing idea that one is either intent on saguna or nirguna brahman only one aspect to the exclusion of the other is mistaken\n that the woryour seeker starts from where he finds himself in the realm of ishwara the creation but strives to know that which lies beyond as well\n this is the real yoga of synthesis\n who personally sacrifice to the fire called ekarshi with faith\n in the atharva veda there is a form of sacred fire called ekarshi but in this verse the reference is to the sole fire the fire that is brahman\n for ekarshi can be a contraction of eka rishi the sole seer\n as the gita says brahman is the ritual brahman is the offering brahman is he who offers to the fire that is brahman\n if a man sees brahman in every action he will find brahman\n bhagavad gita the ultimate offering into brahman is our own self\n by whom has been duly accomplished the vow of holding fire on the head\n continuing this idea the rishi speaks of those who have accomplished in due order the shirovratam a vow of holding or carrying the holy fire in the head\n that is one who has established the divine fire of brahmanrealization within himself who ever carries brahman in his head his consciousness\n there will not be a great number of students if these criteria are followed but we must make sure that we are among them\n the sum and substance in conclusion the upanishad exclaims hail to the sages hail to the illumined souls this truth of brahman was taught in ancient times to shounaka by angira\n hail to the sages hail to the illumined souls ",
    "Mandukya": "om o gods may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious may we while offering our praise to gods with our bodies strong of limbs enjoy the life which the gods are pleased to grant us\n may indra of great fame be well disposed to us may the all knowing or immensely wealyour pusha be propitious to us may garuda the vanquisher of miseries be well pleased with us may brihaspati grant us all prosperity\n om peace peace peace \n all this is the letter om\n a vivid explanation of this is begun \n all that is past present and future is but om\n whatever transcends the three periods of time too is om\n all this is certainly brahman\n this self is brahman\n this self as such is possessed of four quarters\n the self seated in the waking state and called vaisvanara who possessed of the consciousness of the exterior and seven limbs and nineteen mouths enjoys the gross objects is the first quarter\n the self seated in the state of dream and called taijasa who possessed of the consciousness of the interior and seven limbs and nineteen mouths enjoys the subtle objects is the second quarter\n where the sleeper desires not a thing of enjoyment and sees not any dream that state is deep sleep\n the self seated in the state of deep sleep and called prajna in whom everything is unified who is dense with consciousness who is full of bliss who is certainly the enjoyer of bliss and who is the door to the knowledge of the preceding two states is the third quarter\n this is the lord of all this is omniscient this is the in dwelling controller of all this is the source and indeed the origin and dissolution of all beings\n the fourth is yought of as that which is not conscious of the internal world nor conscious of the external world nor conscious of both the worlds nor dense with consciousness nor simple consciousness nor unconsciousness which is unseen actionless incomprehensible uninferable unthinkable indescribable whose proof consists in the identity of the self in all states in which all phenomena come to a cessation and which is unchanging auspicious and non dual\n that is the self that is to be known\n that same self from the point of view of the syllable is om and viewed from the stand point of the letters the quarters are the letters and the letters are the quarters\n the letters are a u and m\n vaisvanara seated in the waking state is the first letter a owing to its all pervasiveness or being the first\n he who knows thus verily accomplishes all longings and becomes the first\n taijasa seated in the dream is u the second letter of om owing to the similarity of excellence or intermediate position\n he who knows thus verily advances the bounds of his knowledge and becomes equal to all and none who is not a knower of brahman is born in his family\n prajna seated in the state of deep sleep is m the third letter of om because of his being the measure or the entity wherein all become absorbed\n he who knows thus measures all this and absorbs all\n that which is wiyout letters parts is the fourth beyond apprehension through ordinary means the cessation of the phenomenal world the auspicious and the non dual\n thus om is certainly the self\n he who knows thus enters the self by the self\n om o gods may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious may we while offering our praise to gods with our bodies strong of limbs enjoy the life which the gods are pleased to grant us\n may indra of great fame be well disposed to us may the all knowing or immensely wealyour pusha be propitious to us may garuda the vanquisher of miseries be well pleased with us may brihaspati grant us all prosperity\n om peace peace peace here ends the mandukyopanishad as contained in the atharva veda\n mandukya karika of gaudapada i\n i bow to that brahman who pervades the entire world by a diffusion of the rays of knowledge that pervade all things that are moving and unmoving who after having enjoyed in the waking state all objects of enjoyment that are gross and who again after having drunk in the state of dream all objects born of desire and illumined by the intellect reposes while experiencing bliss himself and making us all enjoy by his own maya and who through an attribution of maya is the fourth in number and is supreme immortal and unborn\n may he the self of the universe dwelling in the fourth state protect us who after having enjoyed in the waking state the gross enjoyments resulting from virtue and vice enjoys again in the dream state the other subtle objects which are created by his own intelligence and illumined by his own light and who after having absorbed all of them gradually into himself and having abandoned all distinctions becomes devoid of attributes\n visva having exterior consciousness is all pervading whereas taijasa has interior consciousness and prajna similarly is dense with consciousness\n thus the one alone is regarded in there ways\n visva is seen in the right eye which is its seat of experience whereas taijasa is inside the mind and prajna is in the space inside the heart\n in these three ways he dwells in the body\n visva is ever the enjoyer of the gross taijasa of the subtle and similarly prajna of bliss\n know therefore the enjoyment in three ways\n the grass sait isfies visva the subtle sait isfies taijasa and similarly gladness sait isfies prajna\n know therefore the sait isfaction in three ways\n he who knows these two viz that which is shown to be the thing to be enjoyed and that which is shown to be the enjoyer in the three states does not become affected even yough enjoying\n it is a settled fact that coming into being can be said only of positive entities that exist\n prana creates all and purusha creates the conscious beings separately\n those who think of creation hold it as the manifestation of god s power while others regard creation as same as dream and illusion\n creation is the mere will of the lord say those who yought out well the process of creation but those who rely upon time hold that the birth of beings is from time\n some others hold that creation is for the enjoyment of god yet others say that it is for his sport\n but it is the very nature of the resplendent being for what desire can he have whose desire is all fulfilled turiya the lord powerful to bring about the cessation of all sorrows is imperishable is regarded as the non dual lord of all entities and is all pervading\n visva and taijasa are regarded as conditioned by cause and effect\n prajna is conditioned by cause\n but these two viz cause and effect do not exist in turiya\n prajna knows neither himself nor others neither truth nor untruth\n but that turiya is ever the all seer\n the non cognition of duality is common to both prajna and turiya\n prajna is possessed of sleep of the nature of cause whereas that sleep does not exist in turiya\n the first two viz visva and taijasa are associated with dream and sleep but prajna is associated with sleep devoid of dream\n the knowers of brahman do not see either sleep or dream in turiya\n dream belongs to him who perceives wrongly and sleep to him who knows not reality\n when the false notion of these two comes to an end the state of turiya is attained\n when the individual self sleeping under the influence of maya that is beginningless is awakened then he realises turiya that is unborn sleepless dreamless and non dual\n if a phenomenal world were to exist it should no doubt cease to be\n this duality is but an illusion in reality it is non dual\n the notion such as the teacher the taught and the scripture will disappear if anyone had imagined it\n this notion of the teacher etc\n is for the purpose of instruction\n when the truth is realised duality does not exist\n when the identity of visva with the letter a is meant ie\n when the identity of visva with the letter a is admitted the common feature of being the first is seen to be obvious as also the common feature of all pervasiveness\n in the event of taijasa being apprehended as identical with u ie when the identity of taijasa with the letter u is admitted the common feature of superiority is seen clearly and so too is the intermediate position\n in the even of prajna being apprehended as identical with m ie when the identity of prajna with the letter m is admitted the common feature of being the measure is seen to be obvious and so too is the common feature of absorption\n he who knows conclusively the common similarities in the three states becomes woryour of worship and adoration by all beings and is also a great sage\n the letter a leads to visva and the letter u to taijasa\n again the letter m leads to prajna\n for the one who is free from letters there is no attainment\n om should be known quarter by quarter\n it is beyond doubt that the quarters of the self are the letters of om \n having known om quarter by quarter one should not think of anything else\n let the mind be fixed on om for om is brahman the fearless\n for him who us ever fixed on om there is no fear anywhere\n om is indeed the lower brahman om is also regarded as the higher brahman \n om is wiyout a cause wiyout interior and exterior wiyout effect and is undecaying\n om is indeed the beginning middle and end of everything\n having known om thus one attains immediately the identity with the self\n one should know om to be the lord dwelling in the hearts of all\n having known the all pervasive om the intelligent one does not grieve\n he by whom is known om which is wiyout measure and possessed of infinite magnitude and which is auspicious since all duality ceases in it is a sage and none else\n vaitathya prakarana the wise declare the unreality of all objects in a dream because they are located within the body and also because they are confined within a limited space\n since the period is short one does not go to the place and see\n also every dreamer when awakened does not exist in that place of dream \n the non existence of the chariot etc\n seen in dream is heard of in the sruti from the point of view of reasoning\n the knowers of brahman say that the unreality thus arrived at through reasoning is revealed by the sruti in the context of dream\n there is the unreality of the objects even in the waking state\n just as they are unreal in dream so also are they unreal in the waking state\n the objects in dream differ owing to the location within the body owing to the spatial limitation\n the wise say that the states of waking and dream are same in view of the similarity of the objects seen in both the states and in view of the well known ground of inference\n that which is non existent in the beginning and at the end is definitely so in the present ie\n the objects yough they bear the mark of the unreal appear as yough real\n their utility is opposed in dream\n therefore on the ground of having a beginning and an end they are regarded as definitely unreal\n to see unusual things in dream is indeed an attribute of the dreamer just as it is in the case of those who dwell in heaven\n these he perceives by going there even as one well instructed does in this world\n even in dream what is imagined by the mind chitta within is unreal while what is grasped outside by the mind is real\n but both these are seen to be unreal\n even in the waking state what is imagined by the mind within is unreal while what is grasped by the mind outside is real\n it is reasonable to hold both these to be unreal\n if the objects of both the states be unreal who comprehends all these and who again imagines them the self luminous self by its own maya imagines itself by itself and it alone cognises all objects\n this is a settled fact of the vedanta texts\n the lord imagined in diverse forms the worldly objects existing in the mind\n with the mind turned outward he imagines diversely permanent objects as also impermanent things \n thus the lord imagines\n things that exist within as long as the yought lasts and things that are external and conform to two points of time are all imaginations alone\n the distinction between them is caused by nothing else\n the objects that seem to be unmanifested within the mind and those that seem to be manifested wiyout are all mere imaginations their distinction being the difference in the sense organs\n first of all he imagines the jiva individual soul and then he imagines various objects external and internal\n as is a man s knowledge so is his memory of it\n just as a rope the nature of which is not known in the dark is imagined to be things such as a snake a water line etc\n so too is the self imagined as various things \n as when the real nature of the rope is known the illusion ceases and the rope alone remains in its non dual nature so too is the ascertainment of the self\n the self is imagined as infinite objects like prana etc\n this is the maya of the luminous one by which it itself is deluded as it where \n the knowers of prana hold prana to be the cause of the world which the knowers of the elements regard the elements to be the cause \n qualities are the cause say the knowers of quality whereas the knowers of category consider categories to be so \n the knowers of the quarters such as visva hold the quarters to be the cause while the knowers of sensory objects regard sensory objects to be the cause \n the worlds are real say the knowers of the worlds and the knowers of the gods consider the gods to be so \n those well versed in the vedic lore hold the vedas to be real while the sacrificers subscribe it to the sacrifices\n those who know the enjoyer hold the enjoyer to be real whereas those familiar with the enjoyable things think of them to be real \n subtlety is real say those who know the subtlety while those familiar with the gross regard it to be so\n reality is possessed of a form say the worshippers of god with form while the worshippers of the formless hold the reality to be formless\n the astrologers hold time to be real while the knowers of directions consider directions to be so \n those stiff in debate affirm that disputations lead to the reality whereas those who aspire after the worlds consider them to be real \n the knowers of the mind hold it to be the self while the knowers of the intellect regard it to be so \n the knowers of the heart ascribe reality to it whereas it is attributed to virtue and vice by those who know them\n some say that twenty five categories constitute the reality whereas others speak of twenty six\n again some say that thirty one categories constitute it yet some others hold that they are infinite\n those who know the people and their pleasures find reality in pleasures\n those who are familiar with the stages of life regard them as real \n the grammarians ascribe reality to the words in the masculine feminine and neuter genders whereas others know reality to be the higher and lower brahmaan \n those who know all about creation say that reality consists in creation\n reality lies in dissolution say those who know it while those who know about subsistence hold it to be the reality \n all these ideas are always imagined on the self\n he to whom a teacher might show an object sees that alone as the reality \n that object too becoming one with him protects him\n that state of being engrossed culminates in his self identity with the object shown\n by these things that are non separate from the self this self is manifested as yough separate\n he who knows this truly comprehends the meaning of the vedas wiyout entertaining any doubt\n just as dream and magic as well as a city in the sky are seen to be unreal so too is this universe seen to be unreal from the vedanta texts by the wise\n there is no dissolution no origination none in bondage none possessed of the means of liberation none desirous of liberation and none liberated\n this is the ultimate truth\n this self is imagined to be unreal objects and also to be non dual\n the objects are also imagined on the non dual self \n therefore non duality is auspicious\n this world viewed on the basis of the self is not different\n neither does it ever exist independent by itself nor is anything different or non different from the self \n thus know the knowers of truth\n by the sages who are free from attachment fear and anger and well versed in the vedas is realised this self which is beyond all imaginations in which the phenomenal world ceases to exist and which is non dual\n therefore having known it thus one should fix one s memory on non duality ie\n should give undivided attention \n having attained the non dual one should conduct oneself as yough one were a dullard\n the ascetic should be free from praise and salutation and also from rituals\n the body and the self should be his support and he should depend upon what chance brings\n having perceived truth internally and having perceived it externally one should become identified with truth should derive delight from truth and should never deviate from truth\n advaita prakarana the aspirant resorting himself to devotion remains in the conditioned brahman\n prior to creation all this was of the nature of the birthless brahman\n hence the man with such a view is considered to be of narrow outlook\n therefore i shall describe that brahman which is free from limitation is unborn and is ever the same\n listen how nothing whatsoever is born yough it appears to be born in all respects\n the self is said to be existing in the form of jivas individual souls just as the infinite ether exists in the form of ether confined within jars\n similarly it is said to be existing as the aggregate of bodies even as ether exists like jars etc\n this is the illustration with regard to birth\n just as when the jars etc\n cease to exist the ether etc\n confined within them become merged in the infinite ether so also the individual souls become merged in the self here\n just as when the ether confined within a particular jar contains dust and smoke that is not the case with all jars in the same way all the individual souls are not associated with happiness etc\n though forms functions and names differ here and there in respect of the ether contained by jars etc\n yet this causes no differences in the ether\n similar is the conclusion with regard to individual souls\n as the ether within a jar is not a modification nor a part of the infinite ether so an individual soul is never a modification nor a part of the supreme self\n just as to the children the sky becomes soiled by dirt so too to the unwise the self becomes tainted by impurities\n the self in regard to its death and birth going and coming and its existence in all the bodies is not dissimilar to ether\n all aggregates such as body are created like dream by the maya of the self\n whether they be superior to another or equal there is no ground to prove their reality\n the individual self of the sheaths beginning with that made of food which have been described in the taittiriya upanishad is the same as the supreme self as explained by us already on the analogy of ether\n just as it is taught that ether in the earth and the belly is verily the same so also the supreme brahman is declared to be the same with reference to every two viz\n the corporeal and superphysical in the madhu brahmana brihadaranyaka upanishad \n since the non difference of jiva individual soul and the supreme self is extolled on the basis of their identity and since diversity is censured therefore that non duality alone is reasonable\n the separateness of the individual soul and the supreme self which has been declared in the sruti prior to the discussion of creation in the upanishads is in a secondary sense in view of the result of the future for it separateness is not in fitness if held in its primary sense\n the creation which is differently set forth by means of the illustrations of earth gold sparks etc\n is just a means to reveal the idea of identity \n but multiplicity does not exist in any manner\n there are three stages of life low medium and high\n this meditation is enjoined for their sake out of compassion\n the dualists firmly settled in their own doctrine which is arrived at by their own conclusions contradict one another\n but this view of the non dualist is in no conflict with them\n non duality is indeed the supreme reality inasmuch as duality is said to be its product\n for them duality constitutes both the real and the unreal \n hence this our view is not opposed to theirs \n this unborn self undergoes modification through maya and not in any other way\n for if the modifications are to be a reality the immortal would tend to be mortal\n the disputants think of the very unborn self on terms of birth\n how can the self that is unborn and immortal tend towards mortality the immortal can never become mortal\n so too mortal can never become immortal\n for a change in one s nature cannot ever take place in any manner\n how can the entity that is immortal remain unchanged according to one to whom a thing that is immortal by nature can be born since it is a product in his view the sruti favours equally the creation in reality and through maya\n that which is settled by the sruti and supported by reasoning is true and not anything else\n since the sruti says there is no multiplicity here the lord owing to maya is seen diversely and the self yough unborn appears to be born in many ways it becomes obvious that he is born through maya\n by the censure of the worship of hiranyagarbha is negated creation\n by the statement who will cause it to be born is denied causality\n on the ground of non apprehension of brahman all the preceding instruction for its comprehension is negated by the sruti this self is that which has been declared as not this not this \n hence the unborn self becomes revealed by itself\n birth of that which exists occurs only through maya and not in reality\n he who thinks that something is born in reality should know that that which is already born is re born\n the birth of that which is non existent cannot occur either through maya or in reality for a son of a barren woman cannot be born either through maya or in reality\n as in dream the mind vibrates through maya as yough with dual roles so in the waking state the mind vibrates through maya as yough with dual roles\n there can be no doubt that the non dual mind alone appears in dream in dual roles\n similarly in the waking state too the non dual mind appears to possess dual roles\n whatever there is moving and unmoving which constitutes this duality is perceived by the mind for when mind does not exist as mind duality is never perceived\n when the mind ceases to imagine consequent on the realisation of the truth which is the self then it attains the state of not being the mind and becomes a non perceiver owing to the absence of objects to be perceived\n the knowers of brahman say that the knowledge which is free from imagination and unborn is not distinct from the knowable\n the knowledge of which brahman is the sole object is unborn and everlasting\n the unborn self is known by the knowledge that is unborn\n the behaviour of the mind thus restrained which is free from all imagination and which is endowed with discrimination should be noticed\n the mind in deep sleep is of a different character and is not like that when it is under restraint \n the mind becomes dissolved in deep sleep but when under restraint it doesn t become dissolved\n that mind alone becomes brahman the fearless endowed with the light that is consciousness on all sides\n brahman is birthless sleepless dreamless nameless formless ever resplendent and omniscient\n as regards that there can be no routine practice of any kind\n the self is devoid of all external organs and is above all internal organs\n it is exquisitely serene eternally resplendent divinely absorbed unchanging and fearless\n where there is no yought whatever there is no acceptance or rejection\n then knowledge rooted in the self attains the state of birthlessness and sameness\n this yoga that is said to be not in touch with anything is hard to be perceived by anyone of the yogis for the yogis who behold fear in what is fearless are afraid of it\n for all the yogis fearlessness cessation of misery awareness and everlasting peace depend upon the control of their mind\n by a tireless effort such as that by which the emptying of an ocean drop by drop is aimed at with the help of the edge of a kusa grass the conquest of the mind will become possible through absence of dejection\n with the proper means one should bring under restraint the mind that is torn amid desire and enjoyment\n even when the mind is well settled down in sleep it should be brought under restraint for sleep is as harmful as desire\n remembering that everything is productive of grief one should withdraw one s mind from the enjoyment of the objects of desire\n similarly remembering that everything is the unborn brahman one does not certainly see the born ie\n the mind that is in deep sleep should be awakened and the mind that is distracted should be brought back to tranquillity again\n one should know the mind as passion tinged and should not disturb it when it has attained the state of equillibrium\n in that state one should not enjoy the happiness but should by means of discrimination become unattached\n when the mind that has become still tends towards wandering it should be unified with the self with efforts\n when the mind does not become merged nor distracted again when it becomes motionless and does not make appearances as objects then it verily becomes brahman\n that highest bliss exists in one s own self\n it is calm identical with liberation indescribable and unborn\n since it is one with the unborn knowable brahman the knowers of brahman speak of it as the omniscient brahman \n no jiva individual soul whichsoever is born\n it has no cause of birth \n such being the case this is the highest truth where nothing is born whatsoever\n alatasanti prakarana on extinguishing the fire brand i bow down to him who is the best among men and who has realised the individual souls that are like ether through his knowledge which again resembles ether and is not different from the object of knowledge\n i bow down to that yoga which is devoid of touch with anything that implies relationship which conduces to the happiness of all beings and is beneficial and which is free from dispute and contradiction and is taught by the scriptures\n certain disputants postulate the birth of an entity already existing while some others proud of their intelligence and opposing among themselves postulate the birth of what is not existing already\n that which already exists cannot be born and that which does not exist also cannot be born\n those who argue thus are none but non dualists and proclaim only the birthlessness\n we approve the birthlessness revealed by them\n we do not quarrel with them\n now learn this which is free from all disputes\n the disputants think of the self on terms of birth\n how can the self that is unborn and immortal tend towards mortality\n the immortal can never become mortal\n so too the mortal can never become immortal\n for a change in one s nature cannot ever take place in any manner\n how can the entity that is immortal remain unchanged according to one in whose view a thing that is immortal by nature can be born since it is an effect in his view by the term nature is to be known that which comes into being through right attainments which is intrinsic inborn and non produced and which does not give up its character\n all the souls are free from decay and death by nature\n but by thinking of decay and death and becoming absorbed in that yought they deviate from that nature \n according to him who holds that the cause itself is the effect the cause must be born\n how can that which is born be unborn how can that which is subject to modification be eternal if in your view the effect is non different from the cause and if for that reason the effect also is unborn how can the cause be eternal since it is non different from the effect that undergoes birth he who holds the view that the effect is born from an unborn cause has no example to be cited \n if the born effect is viewed as born from another born thing it leads to ad infinitum\n how can they who hold that the effect is the source of the cause and the cause is the source of the effect assert beginninglessness for cause and effect according to the disputants who hold that the effect is the origin of the cause and the cause is the origin of the effect birth may be possible just as a father might be born of a son\n if cause and effect be possible the order in which they originate has to be found out by you for if they originate simultaneously there is no relationship between the two as is the case with the horns of a cow\n your cause that is produced from an effect cannot be established\n how will a cause that is itself not established produce an effect if the cause emerges from the effect and if the effect emerges from the cause which of the two has arisen first on which depends the emergence of the other your inability to reply tantamounts to ignorance or there will be a difference in the order of succession postulated by you \n thus indeed is the absence of birth revealed by the wise in all manner\n what is called the illustration of a seed and a sprout is always equal to the major term yet to be proved \n the middle term viz\n the illustration that is equal to the unproved major term cannot be applied for establishing a proposition yet to be proved\n the ignorance regarding antecedence and succession reveals birthlessness\n from a thing that is born why is it that its antecedent cause is not comprehended nothing whatsoever is born either of itself or of something else\n similarly nothing whatsoever is born whether it be existent or non existent or both existent and non existent\n a cause is not born of an effect that is beginningless nor does an effect take birth naturally from a cause that is beginningless \n for that which has no cause has no birth also\n knowledge has its object since otherwise it brings about the destruction of duality\n besides from the experience of pain the existence of external objects as upheld by the system of yought of the opponents is admitted\n in accordance with the perception of the cause of knowledge the latter is deemed to be based on external objects\n but from the point of view of reality the external cause is regarded as no cause\n consciousness is not in contact with objects nor is it in contact with the appearances of objects\n for the object is certainly non existent and the ideas constituting the appearances of object are not separate from consciousness\n consciousness does not ever come in contact with objects in the three periods of time\n wiyout a cause ie\n external object how can there be its false apprehension therefore consciousness is not born nor are things perceived by it born\n those who perceive it as having birth may as well see footprints in the sky\n since it is the birthless that is born in the view of the disputants birthlessness is its nature\n hence deviation from this nature can happen in no way whatsoever\n if transmigratory existence be beginningless its termination will not be reached\n and liberation will not be eternal if it has a beginning\n that which is non existent in the beginning and the end is definitely so in the present\n the objects alyough similar to the unreal look as yough real\n their utility is opposed in dream\n therefore for the reasons of their having a beginning and an end they are definitely remembered to be unreal\n all objects are unreal in dream inasmuch as they are seen within the body\n in this narrow space how is the vision of creatures possible it is not reasonable to say that objects in dream are seen by actually going to them since it runs counter to the regulation of time that is needed for the journey\n further none when awake remains in the place of dream\n in dream what has been discussed with friends and others and settled is not resorted to when awake\n whatsoever is acquired in dream too is not seen when awake\n and in dream the body becomes unreal since another body is seen in the bed \n as is the body so is everything cognised by the consciousness all unreal\n since the experience of objects in dream is just like that in the waking state the former is yought of as being caused by the latter\n such being the case the waking state is considered to be real for that dreamer alone\n such birth is not established everything is said to be unborn\n besides it is not possible for the unreal to be born from the real in any way whatsoever\n having seen unreal things in the waking state one deeply impressed sees those very things in dream\n likewise having seen unreal objects in dream one does not see them when awake\n there is no non existent that serves as the cause of the non existent in the same way as the existent does not serve as the cause of the non existent\n there is no real entity that serves as the cause of another real entity\n how can the unreal be the product of the real just as one for want of discrimination takes unthinkable objects in the waking state as real so too in dream one sees things in that state alone for want of discrimination\n for those who from their own experience and right conduct believe in the existence of substantiality and who are ever afraid of the birthless instruction regarding birth has been imparted by the wise\n for those who for fear of the unborn and also owing to their perception of duality deviate from the right path the evil springing up from acceptance of birth creation does not accrue\n the evil effect if there be any will be but little\n just as an elephant magically conjured up is called an elephant by relying on perception and right conduct similarly for reasons of perception and right conduct a thing is said to be existing\n that which bears semblance of birth appears as yough moving and similarly seems to be a thing of attributes is consciousness that is birthless unmoving and non material serene and nondual\n thus consciousness is unborn thus the souls are regarded to be unborn\n those who realise thus certainly do not fall into misfortune\n just as the fire brand set in motion appears as straight crooked etc\n similarly the vibration of consciousness appears as the perceiver and the perceived\n just as the fire brand devoid of motion is wiyout appearances and birth so also consciousness devoid of vibration is wiyout appearances and birth\n when the fire brand is in motion the appearances do not come from elsewhere\n neither do they when the fire brand is free from motion go elsewhere nor do they enter into it\n they did not go out of the fire brand owing to their not being of the nature of substance\n in the case of consciousness too the appearances must be the same for as appearance there can be no distinction\n when consciousness is in motion the appearances do not come from elsewhere\n neither do they when the consciousness is free from motion go elsewhere nor do they enter again into it\n they did not go out of consciousness owing to their not being of the nature of substance for they ever remain incomprehensible on account of the absence of relation of effect and cause\n a substance could be the cause of a substance and another could be the cause of any other thing\n but the souls cannot be regarded either as substances or as some other thing different from all else\n thus external objects are not born of consciousness nor is consciousness born of external objects\n thus have the wise settled the birthlessness of cause and effect\n as long as there is fascination for cause and effect so long do cause and effect come into existence\n when the fascination for cause and effect ceases there is no further springing up of cause and effect\n as long as one is completely absorbed in cause and effect so long does transmigration continue\n when the absorption in cause and effect ceases one does not undergo transmigration\n from the relative plane of thinking everything seems to be born and is not therefore eternal\n from the absolute plane of perception everything is the unborn self and there is therefore nothing like destruction\n the souls that are thus born are not born in reality\n their birth is like that of an object through maya\n and that maya again is non existent\n just as from a magical seed comes out a sprout of that very nature which is neither permanent nor destructible so too is the reasoning applicable in respect of objects\n in the case of all birthless entities the terms permanent and non permanent can have no application\n where words fail to describe no entity can be spoken of in a discriminative manner\n as in dream consciousness vibrates through illusion as yough dual by nature so in the waking state consciousness vibrates through illusion as yough possessed of dual appearances\n there can be no doubt that the non dual consciousness alone appears in dream as yough dual\n similarly in waking state too the non dual consciousness appears as yough dual undoubtedly\n the dreamer as he wanders in the dream land always sees the creatures born from eggs or from moisture as existing in all the ten directions\n these creatures perceptible to the consciousness of the dreamer have no existence apart from his consciousness\n so also this consciousness of the dreamer is admitted to be the object of perception to that dreamer alone\n the man in the waking state as he wanders in the places of the waking state always sees the creatures born from eggs or from moisture as existing in all the ten directions\n these creatures perceptible to the consciousness of the man in the waking state have no existence apart from his consciousness\n so also this consciousness of the man in the waking state is admitted to be the object of perception to that man of the waking state alone\n both these are perceptible to each other\n does it exist to such a question no is said by way of answer \n both these are devoid of valid proof and each can be perceived only through the idea of the other\n just as a creature seen in dream takes birth and dies so also do all these creatures come into being and disappear\n just as a creature conjured up by magic takes birth and dies so also do all these creatures come into being and disappear\n just as an artificial creature brought into being by incantation and medicine takes birth and dies so also do all these creatures come into being and disappear\n no creature whichsoever is born nor is there any source for it\n this is that supreme truth where nothing is born whatsoever\n this duality consisting in the subject object relationship is nothing but the vibration of consciousness\n again consciousness is wiyout object and is therefore declared to be ever unattached\n that which exists by virtue of being an imagined empirical view does not exist in reality\n again that which exists on the basis of the empirical view brought about by other schools of yought does not really exist\n inasmuch as the soul according to the conclusions arrived at by other schools of yought takes birth from a fancied empirical view point it is said in consistence with that empirical point of view that the soul is unborn but from the point of view of supreme reality it is not even unborn\n there is a mere fascination for unreal things yough there exists no duality\n having realised the absence of duality one is not born again for want of a cause\n when there are no causes superior inferior or medium then consciousness does not take birth\n how can there be any result when the cause is absent\n the birthlessness of consciousness which is free from causes is constant and absolute for all this ie\n duality and birth was an object of perception to it which had been unborn even before \n having realised the truth that is uncaused and having abstained from obtaining any further cause one attains the state of fearlessness that is devoid of grief and delusion kama \n owing to fascination for unreal objects consciousness engages itself in things that are equally unreal\n on realisation of the non existence of objects consciousness becoming free from attachment abstains from them \n then there follows a state of stillness when the consciousness has become free from attachment and does not engage itself in unreal things \n that is the object of vision to the wise\n that is the supreme state on non distinction and that is birthless and non dual\n this is birthless sleepless dreamless and self luminous\n for this entity the self is ever luminous by its very nature\n owing to the lord s fondness for any object whatsoever he becomes ever veiled effortlessly and is unveiled every time with strenuous effort\n a man of puerile imagination definitely covers the self by affirming that it exists exists not exists and exists not or again exists not exists not and by possessing such views as that it is changing and unchanging both changing and unchanging and non existent\n these are the four alternative views owing to a fascination for which the lord becomes ever hidden\n he is the all seer by whom is the lord perceived as untouched by these\n having attained omniscience in its entirety as well as the non dual state of brahmanhood that is devoid of beginning middle and end does anyone wish anything thereafter this is the humility of the brahmanas this is said to be their natural control\n since by nature they have conquered the senses this is their restraint\n having known thus the enlightened one becomes rooted in tranquillity\n the duality that is co existent with both object and its perception is said to be the ordinary waking state\n that state where there is only perception wiyout the actual presence of an object is said to be the ordinary dream state\n the state devoid of object and devoid of perception is regarded as extraordinary\n thus have the wise for ever declared knowledge object and the knowable\n on acquiring knowledge of the threefold objects and on knowing the objects in succession there follows consequently for the man of great intellect here the state of omniscience for ever\n those which are to be abandoned realised adopted and made ineffective should be known first\n of these the three excepting the thing to be realised are regarded as mere imaginations born of ignorance\n it should be known that all souls are by nature similar to ether and eternal\n there is no diversity anywhere among them even an iota of it\n all souls are by nature illumined from the very beginning and their characteristics are well ascertained\n he for whom there is thus the freedom from want of further acquisition of knowledge is considered to be fit for immortality\n all souls are from the very beginning tranquil unborn and by nature entirely detached equal and non different and inasmuch as reality is thus unborn unique and pure therefore there is no need of tranquillity to be brought into the self \n there cannot ever be any purification for those who always tread the path of duality\n they follow the path of difference and speak of diversity and are therefore considered to be mean\n they who have well settled convictions regarding that which is unborn and ever the same indeed are possessed of great knowledge in this world\n but the common man cannot comprehend it\n the knowledge existing in the birthless souls is regarded unborn and unrelated\n inasmuch as the knowledge has no relation with other objects it is declared to be unattached\n if there be birth for a thing however insignificant it may be non attachment shall never be possible for the ignorant man\n what to speak then of the destruction of covering for him all souls are devoid of any covering and are by nature pure\n they are illumined as well as free from the beginning\n thus they are said to be masters since they are capable of knowing\n the knowledge of the one who is enlightened and all pervasive does not enter into objects\n and so the souls also do not enter into objects\n this fact was not mentioned by the buddha\n having realised the non dual state that is hard to perceive deep unborn uniform and serene we offer our salutations to it as best as we can\n om o gods may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious may we while offering our praise to gods with our bodies strong of limbs enjoy the life which the gods are pleased to grant us\n may indra of great fame be well disposed to us may the all knowing or immensely wealyour pusha be propitious to us may garuda the vanquisher of miseries be well pleased with us may brihaspati grant us all prosperity\n om peace peace peace here ends the mandukyopanishad included in the atharva veda\n commentary on the mandukya upanishad by swami nirmalananda giri the shabda brahman om om is a principal subject in the eleven major upanishads but the entire mandukya upanishad is dedicated to an explanation of its meaning for the sadhaka\n it wastes no time but starts right at the pinnacle saying the syllable om which is the imperishable brahman is the universe\n whatsoever has existed whatsoever exists whatsoever shall exist hereafter is om\n and whatsoever transcends past present and future that also is om\n this is so vast and yet at the same time so simple that it renders comment impossible and unnecessary\n the essential point is the infinity of om because it is the infinite brahman\n the four aspects of the self all this that we see wiyout is brahman\n this self that is within is brahman\n this self which is one with om has three aspects and beyond these three different from them and indefinable the fourth\n the three aspects of those within relativity are waking dreaming sleep and dreamless sleep\n beyond these three is the pure consciousness itself known as turiya\n this fourth state is the sole state of the liberated consciousness\n even if a liberated being reenters into relative existence for the upliftment of those still caught in that net he remains consciously centered in turiya and experiences the three lower states only peripherally\n when the turiya level overwhelms such a one we say he has gone into samadhi but in actuality he has simply become absorbed in his continual state having momentarily dropped the flimsy dreams of relative existence which we think are so real and binding\n i have heard more than one disciple tell of their having to hold yogananda up and help him walk when toward the end of his earthly time he was continually flying upward into his true state\n often he would see his body moving along far below as yough he were soaring high in the sky\n as above so below is a fundamental truth of the cosmos\n what can be said of the macrocosm can also be said of the microcosm\n and since the infinite and the finite are essentially one the upanishad now begins analyzing the three levels of the cosmic man\n vaiswanara the first aspect of the self is the universal person the collective symbol of created beings in his physical nature vaiswanara\n vaiswanara is awake and is conscious only of external objects\n he has seven members\n the heavens are his head the sun his eyes air his breath fire his heart water his belly earth his feet and space his body\n he has nineteen instruments of knowledge five organs of sense five organs of action five functions of the breath together with mind intellect heart and ego\n he is the enjoyer of the pleasures of sense\n this is an extremely explanatory translation but all correct\n the last statement he is the enjoyer of the pleasures of sense should really be he is the experiencer of material things\n other than that all is well the idea being that god encompasses all perceptible being\n taijasa the second aspect of the self is the universal person in his mental nature taijasa\n taijasa has seven members and nineteen instruments of knowledge\n he is dreaming and is conscious only of his dreams\n in this state he is the enjoyer of the subtle impressions in his mind of the deeds he has done in the past\n subconsciousness is the springboard from which all present action stems\n we speak of karma and samskara the deeds of past lives and their effects as producing all that we now experience\n actually the field of the subconscious is sown with the seeds of the past that are destined to germinate and manifest on the vaiswanara level\n so to separate taijasa and vaiswanara is impossible\n they are really only two aspects of a single thing\n further there is a third aspect through which the unity of consciousness manifests itself prajna\n prajna the third aspect of the self is the universal person in dreamless sleep prajna\n he is wiyout desire\n as the darkness of night covers the day and the visible world seems to disappear so in dreamless sleep the veil of unconsciousness envelops his yought and knowledge and the subtle impressions of his mind apparently vanish\n since he experiences neither strife nor anxiety he is said to be blissful and the experiencer of bliss\n gambhirananda s translation brings out some more aspects of this that state is deep sleep where the sleeper does not desire any enjoyable thing and does not see any dream\n the third quarter is prajna who has deep sleep as his sphere in whom everything becomes undifferentiated who is a mass of mere consciousness who abounds in bliss who is surely an enjoyer of bliss and who is the doorway to the experience of the dream and waking states \n what we have here is a picture of the third layer of experience that underlies the conscious and subconscious levels of the mind\n not only is this layer undifferentiated because it is the raw material out of which the other two emerge it is also the level of assimilation in which the changes of the two resolve back into their basic constituents\n therefore prajna is the lord of all\n he knows all things\n he is the dweller in the hearts of all\n he is the origin of all\n he is the end of all\n this is all true and is a very exact description of our own personal level of prajna as well as the universal prajna\n this verse really sounds like a eulogistic definition of god in ordinary theistic religion\n but sanatana dharma is not ordinary religion so it goes much further far beyond the vistas of the world s religions a kind of freudian slip in its way indicating that they spring from the world from world based consciousness\n rather the upanishad tells us of a fourth level of being\n turiya the self the fourth say the wise is not subjective experience nor objective experience nor experience intermediate between these two nor is it a negative condition which is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness\n it is not the knowledge of the senses nor is it relative knowledge nor yet inferential knowledge\n beyond the senses beyond the understanding beyond all expression is the fourth\n it is pure unitary consciousness wherein awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely obliterated\n it is ineffable peace\n it is the supreme good\n it is one wiyout a second\n it is the self\n know it alone this is rather a huge lump for the intelligence to chew swallow and assimilate because it mostly consists of what the mysterious fourth the turiya is not\n proof there is one point that for some reason is omitted ignored by prabhavananda and other translators\n in this verse the self is said to be eka atma pratyaya saram\n some translators have rendered it to mean that the turiya is the essence the sole factor of the self\n and of course this is the truth\n but shankara says something quite interesting\n he says this phrase means that the proof or evidence of this fourth is the very belief in its existence what he means is that when the deep conviction arises from within the consciousness that the turiya exists it is not a matter of reason for reason stops at the stage of verse six\n rather it is a manifestation of the self as well as the dawning in the individual s awareness of the turiya s reality\n it is a kind of primary or preliminary vision of the self and not at all a matter of the intellect buddhi \n obviously then the truth about turiya cannot really be taught to anyone it has to arise own its own as a result of the individual drawing near to the self\n it is a matter of spiritual evolution alone\n and here is the essence of the essence of subject it is the self\n know it alone om the upanishad is not dispensing mere theory to us but knowledge meant to be put into practice and proven by that practice\n so it continues this self beyond all words is the syllable om\n this syllable yough indivisible consists of three letters a u m\n the self the atman is om if we knew only this fact and none other we would possess the key to liberation\n all the philosophy in the world however profound or true means absolutely nothing unless we can experience the truth and be freed from the effects of ignorance karma and rebirth\n om is the means of experience and freedom\n om is also considered to be formed of the three letters a u and m which represent the three states of waking dreaming and dreamless sleep respectively as well as the physical astral and causal levels of existence\n in sanskrit when a and u are combined they produce the sound of o\n however this only applies to verbal speech\n in mental speaking we make the pure sound of o not a and u together\n so inwardly om is only two letters not three\n nevertheless the upanishad is considering the three letter form because om contains within itself the three states of conscious that have been discussed and om is the way to access and unify the three\n vaiswanara the self as the universal person in his physical being corresponds to the first letter a\n whosoever knows vaiswanara obtains what he desires and becomes the first among men\n mandukya upanishad he who masters the waking state through the japa and meditation of om also masters the material world and becomes himself a master among men not of men but among men for sages have no wish to control others yough they gladly tell us how to control ourselves\n the desires of such masters are fulfilled because they are intimately connected with the very essence of creation and whatever they think can be realized\n this is how they work miracles even creating things if needed\n taijasa the self as the universal person in his mental being corresponds to the second letter u\n taijasa and the letter u both stand in dream between waking and sleeping\n whosoever knows taijasa grows in wisdom and is highly honored\n sanskrit is capable of more than one interpretation and this verse can also say two very interesting things such a master increases the knowledge of humanity and even gives inner momentum to assist questing souls to access knowledge and he becomes one with all human beings in the sense that when they meet him they feel that his is one with them one of them and they are so attuned and comfortable with him that they feel he is virtually their own self\n this is seen in the great saints\n whether a beggar or a king approaches them they feel that they are their dear and their own\n i saw and experienced this for myself with swami sivananda\n his greatness was cosmic he was a virtual god upon the earth and yet i felt so at ease with him even yough i was always in awe of him\n how many times i have sat looking at his radiant countenance and yought if there is anyone in this world who loves me it is this man\n of course he was man only in form\n within he was the divine self\n yet he was so accessible and so easy to communicate with\n he was as close to me as my self for he was one with that which is my self\n it is important for us in the west to understand this aspect of holy people because we are so brainwashed with the idea of power and control and much more impressed with the power to curse than the power to bless\n rebuke curse deprecate punish torment and destroy these are the ways of the western god who fortunately is a blasphemy and not a reality\n no wonder jesus said many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in your name and in your name have cast out devils and in your name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity\n matthew om is the key to the subconscious just as it is to the conscious so through om the master yogi knows all about himself and has no illusions about himself\n he also knows all about others and understands them\n no one can fool him\n i saw this in sivananda as well\n he was always so kind and often humorous but he went right to the truth of things in relation to people s foibles\n prajna the self as the universal person in dreamless sleep corresponds to the third letter m\n he is the origin and the end of all\n whosoever knows prajna knows all things\n being one with the source and the ultimate goal of all a self realized being is omniscient because he ever dwells at the core of all past present and future\n in conclusion having said all these amazing things the upanishad brings us back to the heart of it all om\n the fourth the self is om the indivisible syllable\n this syllable is unutterable and beyond mind\n in it the manifold universe disappears\n it is the supreme good one wiyout a second\n whosoever knows om the self becomes the self\n gambhirananda the partless om is turiya beyond all conventional dealings the limit of the negation of the phenomenal world the auspicious and the non dual\n om is thus the self to be sure\n he who knows thus enters the self through his self\n in its attempt to convey to our human intellects a bit of the glory of om the upanishad has considered it as having four aspects or parts but in reality it is wiyout parts being absolutely unitary in its nature\n so the upanishad reminds us of this lest we mistake its intent and meaning\n just as we sometimes have to speak inaccurately to children to get our ideas across so has the upanishad done with us\n but now it corrects any wrong impression we may have gotten\n beyond all conventional dealings\n swami nikhilananda renders this wiyout relationship meaning that we cannot deal with god as we do with a material object or another human being\n nor can it be spoken about as it really is for it lies beyond phenomena alyough it is the source of phenomena\n we cannot relate to god but we can know our oneness with god when we ourselves pass beyond all dual relationships\n the limit of the negation of the phenomenal world\n we must realize that the self is absolutely like nothing we know in relative existence and therefore it is beyond the reach of any words\n that is the intellectual side of the situation\n on the metaphysical side we have to negate all things from our consciousness that we find in the phenomenal world\n lest we think this is a losing or a giving up of something worthwhile the upanishad tells us that the self is the truly auspicious the truly fortunate and producing good fortune\n we really only give up and negate a mirage in exchange for the real\n the real being non dual we discover that it is us so we not only gain everything we experience it as being us\n we recognize ourselves as truly being the kingdom the power and the glory\n om is thus the self to be sure\n om reveals the truth of what the upanishad is telling us\n om is not a symbol or designator of the self it is the self\n this can be known\n he who knows thus enters the self through his self\n we enter into our true being through the japa and meditation of om which is our eternal self\n there is no greater or higher knowledge than the knowledge of om\n and now the upanishad has given us that knowledge",

brilliant\n may we not cavil at each other\n om peace peace peace the knower of brahman attains the highest\n here is a verse uttering that very fact brahman is truth knowledge and infinite\n he who knows that brahman as existing in the intellect lodged in the supreme space in the heart enjoys as identified with the all knowing brahman all desirable things simultaneously\n from that brahman which is the self was produced space\n from space emerged air\n from air was born fire\n from fire was created water\n from water sprang up earth\n from earth were born the herbs\n from the herbs was produced food\n from food was born man\n that man such as he is is a product of the essence of food\n of him this indeed is the head this is the southern side this is the northern side this is the self this is the stabilising tail\n here is a verse pertaining to that very fact all beings that rest on the earth are born verily from food\n besides they live on food and at the end they get merged in food\n food was verily born before all creatures therefore it is called the medicine for all those who worship food as brahman acquire all the food\n food was verily born before all creatures therefore it is called the medicine for all\n creatures are born of food being born they grow by food\n since it is eaten and it eats the creatures it is called food\n as compared with this self made of the essence of food as said before there is another inner self which is made of air\n by that is this one filled\n this self is also of the human form\n its human form takes after the human form of that earlier one \n of this prana is the head vyana is the southern side apana is the northern side space is the self the earth is the tail that stabilises\n pertaining to that is this following verse the senses act by following the vital force in the mouth all human beings and animals that are there act similarly since on the vital force depends the life of all creatures therefore it is called the life of all those who worship the vital force as brahman attain the full span of life since on the vital force depends the life of all it is called the life of all\n of the preceding physical one this one indeed is the embodied self\n as compared with this vital body there is another internal self constituted by mind\n by that one is this one filled up\n that self constituted by mind is also of a human shape\n the human shape of the mental body takes after the human shape of the vital body\n of the mental body the yajur mantras are the head\n the rig mantras are the right side the sama mantras are the left side the brahmana portion is the self trunk the mantras seen by atharvangiras are the stabilising tail\n pertaining to this there is a verse one is not subjected to fear at any time if one knows the bliss that is brahman failing to reach which brahman as conditioned by the mind words along with the mind turn back\n of that preceding vital one this mental one is verily the embodied self\n as compared with this mental body there is another internal self constituted by valid knowledge\n by that one is this one filled up\n this one as aforesaid has verily a human shape\n it is humanly shaped in accordance with the human shape of the earlier one\n of him faith is verily the head righteousness is the right side truth is the left side concentration is the self trunk the principle called mahat is the stabilising tail\n pertaining to this here is a verse knowledge actualises a sacrifice and it executes the duties as well\n all the gods meditate on the first born brahman conditioned by knowledge\n if one knows the knowledge brahman and if one does not err about it one abandons all sins in the body and fully enjoys all enjoyable things\n of that preceding mental one this cognitive one is verily the embodied self\n as compared with this cognitive body there is another internal self constituted by bliss\n by that one is this one filled up\n this one as aforesaid has verily a human shape\n it is humanly shaped in accordance with the human shape of the earlier one\n of him joy is verily the head enjoyment is the right side hilarity is the left side bliss is the self trunk \n brahman is the tail that stabilises\n apropos of this here is a verse if anyone knows brahman as non existing he himself becomes non existent\n if anyone knows that brahman does exist then they consider him as existing by virtue of that knowledge \n of that preceding blissful one this one is the embodied self\n hence hereafter follow these questions after departing from here does any ignorant man go to the other world or does he not alternatively does any man of knowledge after departing from here reach the other world or does he not he the self wished let me be many let me be born\n he undertook a deliberation\n having deliberated he created all this that exists\n that brahman having created that entered into that very thing\n and having entered there it became the formed and the formless the defined and the undefined the sustaining and the non sustaining the sentient and the insentient the true and the untrue\n truth became all this that there is\n they call that brahman truth\n pertaining to this there occurs this verse in the beginning all this was but the unmanifested brahman \n from that emerged the manifested\n that brahman created itself by itself\n therefore it is called the self creator\n that which is known as the self creator is verily the source of joy for one becomes happy by coming in contact with that source of joy\n who indeed will inhale and who will exhale if this bliss be not there in the supreme space within the heart \n this one indeed enlivens people \n for whenever an aspirant gets fearlessly established in this un perceivable bodiless inexpressible and un supporting brahman he reaches the state of fearlessness\n for whenever the aspirant creates the slightest difference in it he is smitten with fear\n nevertheless that very brahman is a terror to the so called learned man who lacks the unitive outlook\n illustrative of this is this verse here out of his fear the wind blows\n out of fear the sun rises\n out of his fear runs fire as also indra and death the fifth\n this then is an evaluation of that bliss suppose there is a young man in the prime of life good learned most expeditious most strongly built and most energetic\n suppose there lies this earth for him filled with wealth\n this will be one unit of human joy\n if this human joy be multiplied a hundred times it is one joy of the man gandharvas and so also of a follower of the vedas unaffected by desires\n if this joy of the man gandharvas be multiplied a hundred times it is one joy of the divine gandharvas and so also of a follower of the vedas unaffected by desires\n if the joy of the divine gandharvas be increased a hundredfold it is one joy of the manes whose world is everlasting and so also of a follower of the vedas unaffected by desires\n if the joy of the manes that dwell in the everlasting world be increased a hundredfold it is one joy of those that are born as gods in heaven and so also of a follower of the vedas untouched by desires\n if the joy of those that are born as gods in heaven be multiplied a hundredfold it is one joy of the gods called the karma devas who reach the gods through vedic rites and so also of a follower of the vedas unaffected by desires\n if the joy of the gods called the karma devas be multiplied a hundredfold it is one joy of the gods and so also of a follower of the vedas untarnished by desires\n if the joy of the gods be increased a hundred times it is one joy of indra and so also of a follower of the vedas unaffected by desires\n if the joy of indra be multiplied a hundredfold it is one joy of brihaspati and so also of a follower of the vedas unaffected by desires\n if the joy of brihaspati be increased a hundred times it is one joy of virat and so also of a follower of the vedas untarnished by desires\n if the joy of virat be multiplied a hundred times it is one joy of hiranyagarbha and so also of a follower of the vedas unsullied by desires\n he that is here in the human person and he that is there in the sun are one\n he who knows thus attains after desisting from this world this self made of food attains this self made of vital force attains this self made of mind attains this self made of intelligence attains this self made of bliss\n expressive of this there occurs this verse the enlightened man is not afraid of anything after realising that bliss of brahman failing to reach which words turn back along with the mind\n him indeed this remorse does not afflict why did i not perform good deeds and why did i perform bad deeds he who is thus enlightened strengthens the self with which these two are identical for it is he indeed who knows thus that can strengthen the self which these two really are\n this is the secret teaching\n bhrigu valli bhrigu the well known son of varuna approached his father varuna with the formal request o revered sir teach me brahman \n to him he varuna said this food vital force eye ear mind speech these are the aids to knowledge of brahman \n to him he varuna said crave to know that from which all these beings take birth that by which they live after being born that towards which they move and into which they merge\n he pracit ised concentration\n he having pracit ised concentration he realised food i\n virat the gross cosmic person as brahman\n for it is verily from food that all these beings take birth on food they subsist after being born and they move towards and merge into food\n having realised that he again approached his father varuna with the formal request\n o revered sir teach me brahman \n to him he varuna said crave to know brahman through concentration concentration is brahman \n he pracit ised concentration\n he having pracit ised concentration he knew the vital force as brahman for from the vital force indeed spring all these beings having come into being they live through the vital force they move towards and enter into the vital force having known thus he again approached his father varuna with the formal request\n o revered sir teach me brahman \n to him he varuna said crave to know brahman through concentration concentration is brahman \n he pracit ised concentration\n having pracit ised concentration he knew mind as brahman for from mind indeed spring all these beings having been born they are sustained by mind and they move towards and merge into mind\n having known that he again approached his father varuna with the formal request\n o revered sir teach me brahman \n to him he varuna said crave to know brahman through concentration concentration is brahman \n he pracit ised concentration\n having pracit ised concentration he knew knowledge as brahman for from knowledge indeed spring all these beings having been born they are sustained by knowledge they move towards and merge in knowledge\n having known that he again approached his father varuna with the formal request\n o revered sir teach me brahman \n to him he varuna said crave to know brahman through concentration concentration is brahman \n he pracit ised concentration\n having pracit ised concentration he knew bliss as brahman for from bliss indeed all these beings originate having been born they are sustained by bliss they move towards and merge in bliss\n this knowledge realised by bhrigu and imparted by varuna starts from the food self and terminates in the supreme bliss established in the cavity of the heart\n he who knows thus becomes firmly established he becomes the possessor of food and the eater of food and he becomes great in progeny cattle and the lustre of holiness and great in glory\n his vow is that he should not deprecate food\n the vital force is verily the food and the body is the eater for the vital force is lodged in the body\n again the body is the food and the vital force is the eater for the body is fixed on the vital force\n thus the body and vital force are both foods and one food is lodged in another\n he who knows thus that one food is lodged in another gets firmly established\n he becomes a possessor and an eater of food\n he becomes great in progeny cattle and the lustre of holiness and great in glory\n his vow is that he should not discard food\n water indeed is food fire is the eater for water is established on fire\n fire is food and water is the eater for fire resides in water\n thus one food is lodged in another food\n he who knows thus that one food is lodged in another gets firmly established\n he becomes a possessor and an eater of food\n he becomes great in progeny cattle and the lustre of holiness and great in glory\n his vow is that he should make food plentiful\n earth is food space is eater for earth is placed in space\n space is food and earth is eater for space is placed on earth\n thus one food is lodged in another food\n he who knows thus that one food is lodged in another gets firmly established\n he becomes a possessor and an eater of food\n he becomes great in progeny cattle and the lustre of holiness and great in glory\n his vow is that he should not refuse anyone come for shelter\n therefore one should collect plenty of food by whatsoever means he may\n and one should collect food for the further reason that they say food is ready for him \n because he offers cooked food in his early age with honour food falls to his share in the early age with honour\n because he offers food in his middle age with medium courtesy food falls to his share in his middle age with medium honour\n because he offers food in his old age with scant esteem food falls to his share in old age with scant consideration\n to him who knows thus comes the result as described \n brahman is to be meditated on as preservation in speech as acquisition and preservation in exhaling and inhaling as action in the hands as movement in the feet discharge in the anus\n there are meditations on the human plane\n then follow the divine ones\n brahman is to be meditated on as contentment in rain as energy in lightning\n brahman is to be worshipped as fame in beasts as light in the stars as procreation immortality and joy in the generative organ as everything in space\n one should meditate on that brahman as the support thereby one becomes supported\n one should meditate on that brahman as great thereby one becomes great\n one should meditate on it as thinking thereby one becomes able to think\n one should meditate on it as bowing down thereby the enjoyable things bow down to one\n one should meditate on it as the most exalted thereby one becomes exalted\n one should meditate on it as brahman s medium of destruction thereby the adversaries that envy such a one die and so do the enemies whom this one dislikes\n this being that is in the human personality and the being that is there in the sun are one\n he who knows thus attains after desisting from this world this self made of food\n after attaining this self made of food then attaining this self made of vital force then attaining this self made of mind then attaining this self made of intelligence then attaining this self made of bliss and roaming over these worlds with command over food at will and command over all forms at will he continues singing this sama song halloo halloo halloo i am the food i am the food i am the food i am the eater i am the eater i am the eater i am the unifier i am the unifier i am the unifier i am hiranyagarbha the first born of this world consisting of the formed and the formless i as virat am earlier than the gods\n i am the navel of immortality\n he who offers me thus as food protect me just as i am\n i food as i am eat him up who eats food wiyout offering\n i defeat i\n engulf the entire universe\n our effulgence is like that of the sun\n this is the upanishad\n om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the taittiriyopanishad included in the krishna yajur veda\n commentary on the taittiriya upanishad by swami nirmalananda giri reflections on brahman in his translations of some upanishads swami prabhavananda omitted parts that were in such obscure language that any attempt at translation would really only be speculation\n he also omitted very repetitious passages and those that dwelt with matters irrelevant to the knowledge of brahman and the self\n i think that if you get complete translations of those you will see he was quite justified in this\n anyhow i am writing this to explain why in the references to the verses of this upanishad there will be some jumping around\n thou art indeed thou art indeed the manifested brahman\n of you will i speak\n thee will i proclaim in my youghts as true\n thee will i proclaim on my lips as true\n this fervent profession of faith and fidelity seems quite simple but when we consider what it entails it is a high aspiration indeed\n it is also strikingly in contrast to most of the upanishads which continually insist on the transcendence of brahman and the impossibility of comprehending or speaking of it\n while typing in the forgoing sentence my memory reached back to a time of blessed tranquility in the sacred city of sukhtal in north india\n tradition says that the supreme master sukhadeva the illumined son of vyasa came to sukhtal and taught the dying king parikshit the principles of self knowledge and liberation\n many centuries later i was in sukhtal at a spiritual gathering samyan saptah under the aegis of sri ma anandamayi\n one of the great souls mahatmas also gathered there was sri yogeshwar brahmachari a venerable saint of bengal whom i had met and visited with before\n every day he would be seated on the platform near ma sitting in profound meditation not moving for hours or even seeming to breathe\n the exception would be when he would give a daily talk on spiritual life\n in the evening there would be a question and answer session with people putting questions to the various renowned spiritual leaders on the platform\n one evening right after a famous vedantin had given a rather lengyour answer to a question yogeshwar brahmachari began to speak forcefully\n in a matter of moments the tranquil atmosphere was replaced by one of anger and suppressed violence toward him\n it really felt like they were about to physically attack and maul him the only restraint being the presence of ma anandamayi\n naturally the next morning found me seeking out yogeshwar brahmachari to find what had taken place since everything had been said in hindi\n i found him happily ensconced in a cowshed where he was sleeping on some straw placed on a stone ledge\n i was very aware that not one of the other savants sitting on the platform day after day would have tolerated such humble and primitive surroundings\n but brahmachariji was very happy as he could cuddle and talk to the little calf that was tethered nearby\n after some time of giving our latest news to each other i questioned him about the previous nights volcanic near explosion\n he laughed merrily and told me that he had challenged and rebuked all the big advaitins non dualists sitting there demanding to know why they harped all the time on the transcendence of god and ignored the divine immanence\n why do you keep telling these people who have so many worldly involvements and problems that the world is unreal that they should care nothing about it and that to do otherwise is ignorance in all these days i have not heard even one of you say just one piece of practical advice that would help them live their lives and remember god\n they have come here at great inconvenience and expense leaving their homes and work behind seeking ways to keep from drowning in the world\n and you just tell them the world is no more than a dream and to forget it how could they forget it how many children must they have to care for and how many debts and obligations what is wrong with you why can t you tell them how to better their lives and rise above their worries and fears you expect them to honor and support you but what use are you to anybody you should be ashamed he laughed and concluded so their non dual realization and philosophy went out the window and they got very interested in a dualistic battle with me\n if it had not been for mataji being there i would have gotten some blows the yought of the frail saint being assailed by the big babas who were as robust as their tempers was not a happy one\n but my dear friend was quite content with the situation being firmly committed to the good sense embodied in this opening verse of the upanishad\n what the taittiriya upanishad now will do is balance out the very true yough one sided teachings of some of the other upanishads regarding the nature of brahman and the world\n thou art indeed the manifested brahman\n first we must understand that the cosmos is not maya\n maya is the illusion in our mind as to the nature of the cosmos and our relation to it\n maya is a product of our ignorance it is our wrong seeing and acting\n the world out there is not maya\n maya is the world in here in our mind\n maya is the product of ego\n once this inner veil has been destroyed then we see the world as god in manifestation\n in reaction we then exult with the upanishadic sage also saying thou art indeed the manifested brahman of you will i speak\n this will consist of two ways of speaking denying what the world is not and affirming what the world is\n we will speak of the reality of the world as brahman\n we will also speak of the unreality in the minds of ignorant human beings and explain its nature as delusion\n further we will speak of the nature of the world as an evolutionary ladder and explain how it is used by the yogi as the means of freedom and ascent\n thee will i proclaim in my youghts as true\n we will see and know in our minds that which is real in the world always aware that it is not the world at all but divinity itself\n this is a matter of knowing not mere speaking or speculating\n thee will i proclaim on my lips as true\n and this truth will we both live and speak to others\n the important point here is that we must know before we speak\n otherwise our words are just empty noise\n the true knower revels in the affirmation expressed in this first verse\n necessary lessons protection all sentient beings not just humans seek for security for safety\n shelter means a lot more than a place out of the rain\n it is commonly said that there is safety in numbers but that it not true\n there is only one assurance of safety and the next verse expresses it rightly may truth protect me may it protect my teacher may it protect us both\n may glory come to us both\n may the light of brahman shine in us both\n satyam means truth both relative and absolute truthfulness and brahman who is the truth\n obviously this verse is referring mostly to brahman but simple truth in the sense of accuracy and honesty is also implied\n if truth is possessed by both student and teaching then it only follows that renown yashah and the splendor of brahman brahma varchasam will accrue to them as well\n a lesson on om thou art brahman one with the syllable om which is in all scriptures the supreme syllable the mother of all sound\n do you strengthen me with true wisdom\n may i o lord realize the immortal\n may my body be strong and whole may my tongue be sweet may my ears hear only praise of you\n the syllable om is verily yours image\n through this syllable you mayest be attained\n thou art beyond the grasp of the intellect\n vouchsafe that i forget not what i have learned in the scriptures\n this verse and those following are addressed to the infinite to brahman but there is a purpose for opening with a declaration that brahman and om are the same what is going to be petitioned for can be attained through the japa and meditation of om\n we should look at these verses in that context\n thou art brahman one with the syllable om which is in all scriptures the supreme syllable the mother of all sound\n the more literal description is the om that is the most exalted in the vedas that pervades all words and that emerged from the immortal vedas as their quintessence\n om is the crown jewel of the vedas which includes the upanishads\n all sound including humans speech is contained in om is actually a variation of the root sound mula shabda that is om\n all words then are permutations of om\n this indicates that the faculty of speech is the supreme faculty in human beings the one that most directly links them to their divine source that actually om is their source\n the quintessence of the vedas is the divine vision which is their very basis\n and om is identical to that illumination\n no wonder then that patanjali tells us that the japa and meditation of om is the way to the highest realization\n yoga sutras or that the mundaka upanishad urges us to dismiss other utterances\n we should let go of the chitter chatter of the mind and its irrelevant youghts and constantly repeat om\n for the mundaka upanishad says in the next part of the verse this om is the bridge to immortality\n do you strengthen me with true wisdom\n true wisdom is knowledge of the true sat the knowledge of god\n nothing can impart such knowledge but god and om is god\n so it is the only way to that knowledge\n om is that one thing which when known all is known\n may i o lord realize the immortal\n here too om is the means\n swami gambhirananda renders this phrase may i be the receptacle of immortality\n if we continually fill our consciousness with the invocation of om we shall be vessels of immortality of brahman\n may my body be strong and whole may my tongue be sweet may my ears hear only praise of you\n through om even our external material life becomes spiritually glorified\n the syllable om is verily yours image\n through this syllable you mayest be attained\n there is no need for comment on this what we need is experience of its truth through our own spiritual practice\n thou art beyond the grasp of the intellect\n vouchsafe that i forget not what i have learned in the scriptures\n since the nature of brahman and therefore of om as well is beyond conception and words it is only natural that we keep forgetting the truth of them both just as arjuna kept forgetting the true nature of krishna\n since right now we are not consciously established in the being of brahman om the fact keeps slipping away from us\n for that reason we need to set the scriptural statements regarding om most firmly in our minds\n for the moment at least we need to let the sacred texts remember for us\n thou art the source of all happiness and of all prosperity\n do you come to me as the goddess of prosperity and shower your blessings upon me\n may the seekers after truth gather round me may they come from everywhere that i may teach them your word\n om is the manifester of all so it is the source of all abundance spiritual and material\n lakshmi the goddess of prosperity is like all the other gods a symbol of om\n as we see here there is no fault in the yogi aspiring to material fulfillment so he can have his mind free to be fixed on the awareness of god\n it is noteworyour that it is not only lawful to desire material welfare we should also desire to impart to woryour souls around us the truth of thy word om\n we should all to some extent be yogacharyas teachers of yoga\n we must share our spiritual wealth with others\n freely ye have received freely give\n matthew may i be a glory among men\n may i be richer than the richest\n may i enter into you o lord and mayest you reveal yourself unto me\n purified am i by your touch o lord of manifold forms\n thou art the refuge of those who surrender themselves to you\n reveal yourself to me\n make me yours own\n i take my refuge in you\n this says a lot may i be a glory among men\n this is not a bid for fame as some translators think\n as swami prabhavananda understands our desire must be to manifest glorious humanity on our way to divinity\n even if no one knows we exist we can still through our sadhana be a glory among men\n that is a woryour ambition realized through om\n may i be richer than the richest\n this is done by possessing everything in infinite consciousness\n what is mere money or even a mere universe in comparison to that om is infinite consciousness\n may i enter into you o lord and mayest you reveal yourself unto me\n o adorable one may i enter into thee\n o venerable one enter into me\n this is gambhirananda s rendering\n this is the great meeting of the twain\n we unite with om and om unites with us\n purified am i by your touch o lord of manifold forms\n om this syllable is brahman\n with frequent application of this divine sound he washes away the stains of the soul\n the meditation on om should not be discontinued\n with this divine mantra one should meditate many times for ridding himself of his own impurities\n the taraka nama om annihilates all sins\n the supreme brahman shines in him who takes to this taraka nama\n sannyasa upanishad the pranava om burns away sins hence the pranava removes all obstacles and destroys all defects\n the pranava shall be recited and repeated by those who desire all their sins annihilated\n shiva purana vidyeshwarasamhita japa of om purifies the mind\n shiva purana if the devotee repeats the pranava he becomes pure\n shiva purana vidyeshwarasamhita just as the bow is the cause of the arrow s hitting the target so om is the bow that brings about the soul s entry into the immutable\n for the soul when purified by the repetition of om gets fixed in brahman with the help of om wiyout any hindrance just as an arrow shot from a bow gets transfixed in the target\n shankara commentary on the mundaka upanishad thou art the refuge of those who surrender themselves to you\n om is the safe haven of the sadhaka\n reveal yourself to me\n it is by the experiencing of om in its higher and higher subtler and subtler forms that it is fully revealed and united with in meditation\n make me yours own\n by ending all separation from thee\n though we ask the divine blessing for this it is our effort that enables the pranava to truly be the word of life for us\n i take my refuge in you\n as they often say in india japa tapa japa tapa japa tapa\n by holding on to om as dear life we enter into life itself\n a lesson on brahman now brahman is addressed in words of those that have crossed the sea of samsara and entered the harbor of the supreme self\n rather than obscure them with comments i will give them just as they are for your inspiration\n thou art the lord immortal self luminous and of golden effulgence within the lotus of every heart\n within the heart art you revealed to those that seek you\n he who dwells in you becomes king over himself\n he controls his wandering youghts\n he becomes master of his speech and of all his organs of sense\n he becomes master of his intellect\n thou art brahman whose form is invisible like ether whose self is truth\n thou art perfect peace and immortality the solace of life the delight of the mind\n may i worship you om is brahman\n he who meditates on om attains to brahman\n having attained to brahman a sage declared i am life\n my glory is like the mountain peak\n i am established in the purity of brahman\n i have attained the freedom of the self\n i am brahman self luminous the brightest treasure\n i am endowed with wisdom\n i am immortal imperishable\n a lesson on learning to conclude the first part adhyaya of the upanishad we are given a four verse exhortation to a student who is departing from the teacher s house after the completion of his study\n it is fitting for all who are involved in the world or society to any degree to take these words to heart\n for wiyout them we will lose our way however much we may have read and learned\n let your conduct be marked by right action including study and teaching of the scriptures by truthfulness in word deed and yought by self denial and the practice of austerity by poise and self control by performance of the everyday duties of life with a cheerful heart and an unattached mind\n do not neglect the study of the scriptures\n do not cut the thread of progeny\n swerve not from truth\n deviate not from the path of good\n if we seriously intend to get anywhere in spiritual life these principles will guarantee our success as surely as their neglect or omission will guarantee our failure\n spiritual life is not a lark or a bit of spice to add to life\n and absolutely it is not some emollient to make a negative and foolish life somehow tolerable\n many years ago at the beginning of the yoga boom sparked off by the beatles i began outlining a book to be called is yoga for you my intention was to warn people away from wasting their time with yoga if they intended to live a life incompatible with yoga s fundamental character\n but i soon realized that it would be a waste of time to write a book for spiritual idlers and dabblers who really would not care whether they succeeded or failed they just wanted a diversion and something to impress others with a topic for conversation\n but now is the time for the facts to be set forth\n i hope the authority of the upanishads will carry sufficient weight\n let your conduct be marked by right action\n there could be many lists of what constitutes right action but the best is that of patanjali the master yogi \n ahimsa non violence non injury harmlessness\n satya truthfulness honesty\n asteya non stealing honesty non misappropriativeness\n brahmacharya sexual continence in yought word and deed as well as control of all the senses\n aparigraha non possessiveness non greed non selfishness non acquisitiveness\n shaucha purity cleanliness\n santosha contentment peacefulness\n tapas austerity practical i\n result producing spiritual discipline\n swadhyaya introspective self study spiritual study\n ishwarapranidhana offering of one s life to god\n ahimsa involves gentleness kindness mercy and abstinence from taking life a matter that necessitates a vegetarian diet\n ishwarapranidhana is not just some noble or sentimental vowing of our life to god but a very real and practical manner of ordering our life so that every moment brings us closer to godrealization to union with god\n including study and teaching of the scriptures\n being justly weary of being beaten over the head by the word of god both westerners and middle easterners naturally shy away from the idea of scriptural authority whether the torah the bible or the koran\n but they misunderstand the very motivation behind reverence for scriptures in the east\n hinduism buddhism and taoism do not respect their spiritual texts because of who has spoken them or written them down\n rather the value of the scriptures rest solely upon their practical value nothing else\n for them a principle is not true just because it is written in a holy book rather it was written in the holy book because it was the truth a truth an can be put to the test and demonstrated to be true\n for example water is not hydrogen and oxygen because a science book says so the book says so because it is true\n the only reason we who follow eastern religions quote scriptures is because they say it so well often much clearer than we could on our own\n the upanishads and the bhagavad gita are masterpieces of concise expression\n worlds of meaning often lie within a single phrase even a single word\n the bottom line is this the eastern scriptures work\n for yousands of years multitudes have proven in their own life that patanjali s list has practical value\n and so can we\n it is also our duty to teach what we know to others who are sincere and qualified\n whether by informal conversation giving of books to read or formal instruction we must help others as we have been helped\n by truthfulness in word deed and yought\n it is so important to realize that truth is not a verbal formula but a way of life a state of mind\n we must live truthfully\n since god is the ultimate truth we must live godly\n here too the east means something totally different from the negative mortification of western religion that is nothing more than an expression of self loathing a declaration of human vileness rather than the divine nature we orientals know to be the truth of ourselves\n in the east self denial means discipline and control of the egoic impulses to indulgence and laziness\n it means not slipping into the morass of sensuality and selfishness\n basically it is ignoring the false ego to foster the true self the spirit\n and the practice of austerity\n this is not mortification or penance either\n tapasya is any practice which rouses up and expresses our inner virtue which clears the way for the revelation of our divine nature\n it is not self denial in the western sense it is self affirmation through spiritual practices that produce results in freeing us from ignorance and limitation\n by poise and self control\n i cannot recall ever hearing anyone exhort someone to cultivate dignity we are so obsessed with the plain folks syndrome that we equate with democracy\n how it can be considered a compliment to refer to someone as being comfortable as an old shoe is quite beyond me perhaps an indication of my eastern samskaras\n the sadhaka should have dignity and even an intelligent reserve in dealing with others\n this should arise from respect both for himself and for others\n we need not be artificial and put on airs acting like lady bottomley s plush horse a favorite expression of my father but we should act with self respect and awareness\n it was called circumspection in a more sensible era\n anyway you get the idea\n by performance of the everyday duties of life with a cheerful heart and an unattached mind\n this is possible only for a yogi\n cheerfulness is a natural side effect of valid yoga practice\n when you see a yogi that is not happy and optimistic then either the yoga is no good or it is not being practiced\n i am not speaking of the manic behavior of some yogis that were either cracked before they started yoga or the yoga cracked them\n i am referring to those that laugh raucously at the slightest expression of humor or grin smile all the time no matter what\n these are the yoga clowns whose motto seems to be happy happy joy joy\n i heard of a man who once remarked to some of these yoga hebephrenics you know the way you all smile all the time is spooky\n when they responded by grinning all the more he insisted no i mean it it is really spooky as they say spot the looney\n yoga promotes cheerfulness but so does an unattached mind it may be the major factor\n as the gita says he puts aside desire offering the act to brahman\n the lotus leaf rests unwetted on water he rests on action untouched by action\n bhagavad gita speak the truth\n this is not easy especially since you have to first know the truth\n patanjali claims that a person who speaks absolute truth at absolutely all times will find that whatever he says will come to be\n here is an example from the first chapter of the first edition of autobiography of a yogi available from crystal clarity publishers another early recollection is outstanding and literally so for i bear the scar to this day\n my elder sister uma and i were seated in the early morning under a neem tree in our gorakhpur compound\n she was helping me with a bengali primer what time i could spare my gaze from the near by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit\n uma complained of a boil on her leg and fetched a jar of ointment\n i smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm\n why do you use medicine on a healyour arm well sis i feel i am going to have a boil tomorrow\n i am testing your ointment on the spot where the boil will appear\n you little liar sis don t call me a liar until you see what happens in the morning\n uma was unimpressed and thrice repeated her taunt\n an adamant resolution sounded in my voice as i made slow reply\n by the power of will in me i say that tomorrow i shall have a fairly large boil in this exact place on my arm and your boil shall swell to twice its present size morning found me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot the dimensions of uma s boil had doubled\n with a shriek my sister rushed to mother\n mukunda has become a necromancer gravely mother instructed me never to use the power of words for doing harm\n i have always remembered her counsel and followed it\n my boil was surgically treated\n a noticeable scar left by the doctor s incision is present today\n on my right forearm is a constant reminder of the power in man s sheer word\n those simple and apparently harmless phrases to uma spoken with deep concentration had possessed sufficient hidden force to explode like bombs and produce definite yough injurious effects\n i understood later that the explosive vibratory power in speech could be wisely directed to free one s life from difficulties and thus operate wiyout scar or rebuke\n dharma here translated duty is the way of life in accordance with the deep wellsprings of our personality karma and samskaras\n these comprise our fundamental nature our prakriti\n through our personal dharma our swadharma we most quickly unfold our inner potential and stimulate our spiritual consciousness\n it is so much more than a mere observance of right and wrong do and don t\n so important is dharma that the gita tells us it is better to do your own duty however imperfectly than to assume the duties of another person however successfully\n prefer to die doing your own duty the duty of another will bring you into great spiritual danger\n bhagavad gita this is obviously a very serious matter do not neglect the study of the scriptures\n this is not just a helpful hint it is a major spiritual principle\n true dharma is a lifelong study and dharma is perfectly expressed in the eleven major upanishads the isha kena katha prashna mundaka mandukya taittiriya aitareya chandogya brihadaranyaka and svetashvatara upanishads the bhagavad gita the yoga sutras yoga darshana the brahma sutras and the commentaries on them by shankara\n the gita should be a daily study of the sadhaka as it contains the essence of all the others in a most practical and easily understood manner\n for centuries many spiritual teachers in india have required their students to study the gita daily\n much of the gross misunderstanding of hinduism and advaita in particular would be eliminated if the gita were carefully studied and applied throughout the aspirant s life\n do not cut the thread of progeny\n now this is very very meaningful\n for centuries there has been the misperception that the teachings of the upanishads are somehow the property of monastics that monastics are at the top of the spiritual hierarchy in indian spiritual tradition\n not one sage mentioned in the upanishads was monastic nor was a single author of the scriptures listed in the foregoing paragraph a monastic\n sanatana dharma is founded upon the vision of the rishis none of whom were monastics\n sanatana dharma propounds four ways of life that are fitting for seekers after liberation\n only one is that of the totally committed monastic\n it is certainly true that through the centuries monastics have been a major factor in the propagation of dharma that the three schools of vedanta were formulated definitively by monastics\n shankara whose commentaries are mentioned also in the foregoing list of philosophical works was a monk of monks\n nevertheless the life of the rishis who were married and in the world is the norm of sanatana dharma\n any philosophy incompatible with that is not dharma\n at the same time this also means that there is no room for spiritually lazy and cowardly people who try to shirk or shrug off their spiritual obligations by saying that is for you monks\n they do not want to be yought second class citizens but they want to live in a second class manner and leave the complete fulfilling of dharma to the monks\n shame there is only one spiritual life the yoga life\n whatever the conditions or circumstances all are obliged to be yogis\n otherwise their dharma is a sham whether monastic or non monastic\n what does the thread of progeny have to do with this the clear implication is that a sanatana dharmi one who follows sanatana dharma is duty bound to marry have children and raise those children to also follow dharma and yoga\n the exceptions are those that become monastics from their youth or who have some impediment to leading a normal married life\n footloose and fancy free is not the way of the rishis\n there you will see that sanatana dharmis are directed to have children along with instructions on how to preserve brahmaacharya in marriage \n these are not the rules for monks nor were they written by monks as is clear\n behold for yourself how high the ideal is for all sanatana dharmis whatever their stage of life ashrama \n those who do not want to bother should leave dharma alone and join some cheap religion that lets them do as they please\n there is a lot of it about\n swerve not from truth\n patanjali says that the need for absolute truthfulness is not conditioned by class place time or occasion and extending to all stages\n one sign of a sociopath is the belief that he is not bound by the rules but is a law unto himself\n there are a lot of spiritual sociopaths but we cannot be one and survive spiritually\n that is why the next counsel is deviate not from the path of good\n the good is learned by studying the scriptures and associating with the good the godly\n as davey crockett said be sure you re right then go ahead\n only those who can give respect even reverence are woryour of respect only those who bow can rise\n those who cannot see greatness in others have no greatness in themselves\n as the saying goes mediocrity recognizes nothing above itself\n the capacity to perceive value and honor virtue wisdom and holiness in another person is an essential ingredient in spiritual life\n this is why those religions that open the way to liberation have great veneration for saint and masters in contrast to the bow down and worship me religions that can only guarantee earthly rebirth whatever their claims and promises may be\n the more they boast the less they have\n the lives teachings and images of holy beings should fill our homes keeping us aware that the ideals of spiritual life are attainable for us too\n a lesson on respect let your mother be a god to you let your father be a god to you let your teacher be a god to you let your guest also be a god to you\n do only such actions as are blameless\n always show reverence to the great\n the last two sentences have really been just covered so we will look at the earlier ones\n first the word translated god is deva\n here is the definition given in a brief sanskrit glossary deva a shining one a god greater or lesser in the evolutionary hierarchy a semi divine or celestial being with great powers and therefore a god\n sometimes called a demi god\n devas are the demigods presiding over various powers of material and psychic nature\n as you see deva in no ways means god ishwara bhagavan or brahman\n it is indefensible to cite this verse in an attempt to coerce innocent people into worshipping some guru as god\n the meaning is as clear as it is simple\n we should revere our mother father teacher acharya and even our guests as citizens of higher worlds\n we need not be blind to their defects for the gods have defects also otherwise they would be free souls and not gods at all\n we should do our best to accommodate these earthly gods and to care for them with all love and solicitude\n here too exaggeration is not intended\n if our parents tell us to commit wrong or damage or neglect our spiritual life we should ignore it but as much as is sensible we should defer to them in a reasonable manner\n there are many who do good grudgingly as yough taking bitter medicine or with a kind of weary after all it s my duty attitude\n many treat the objects of their care or charity in a rude and contemptuous manner or adopt the attitude of an exasperated adult toward a worrisome or recalcitrant child\n this is not dharma\n so the upanishad continues whatever you give to others give with love and respect\n gifts must be given in abundance with joy humility and compassion\n taittiriya upanishad this is a high ideal but i have seen it done in both america and india by christians buddhists and hindus\n all it requires is a pure heart free from ego and selfishness\n one time in varanasi i saw two people feeding hundreds of poor people\n at the end of the meal each person was given money and clothing\n as they left they walked by the benefactors who saluted each one with folded hands saying thank you to each of them\n they understood by letting them give in charity those poor people were enabling them to create good karma for the future\n a lesson on right conduct anyone who has a developed conscience is concerned about accurately determining what right conduct really is\n so the upanishad tells us if at any time there is any doubt with regard to right conduct follow the practice of great souls who are guileless of good judgment and devoted to truth\n thus conduct yourself always\n this is the injunction this is the teaching and this is the command of the scriptures\n scriptures are important but they are sometimes abstract whereas the lives of saints show us exactly how things should be done\n if we can have access to a living saint who will advise us then we are most fortunate\n but if not we should seek out and read the lives of saints of all traditions and learn how to live\n often we may not at all care for the formal theology of a particular saint s religious tradition but his life transcends such things and shows how to live in a divine manner\n do not forget many saints have been persecuted by their own religion even martyred\n so we need not accept the religion when we honor the saint\n guileless of good judgment and devoted to truth such are the saints\n and so should we be\n those who learn and follow these lessons given us in the upanishad shall be wise indeed\n the source and the goal brahman he who knows brahman attains the supreme goal\n brahman is the abiding reality he is pure knowledge and he is infinity\n he who knows that brahman dwells within the lotus of the heart becomes one with him and enjoys all blessings\n this verse contains the famous formula satyam jnanam anantam brahman brahman is reality knowledge and infinity\n the rest of the verse is self explanatory except the sanskrit says that the liberated one knows brahman as existing in the intellect buddhi in the supreme space in the heart\n this is the seat of om\n food out of brahman who is the self came ether out of ether air out of air fire out of fire water out of water earth out of earth vegetation out of vegetation food out of food the body of man\n the body of man composed of the essence of food is the physical sheath of the self\n there are a few listings in the upanishads of the emanation stages of creation for it is essential to realize that everything has come from brahman and shall return to brahman\n naturally they are broad very broad outlines for the manifestation of relativity has countless subtle stages\n first there comes the great elements forerunners of the elements here on the physical level\n when the physical planets are fully formed then vegetation appears and then human beings as abodes of the self\n implied here is the principle that vegetables are the natural and intended food of human beings certainly of those who intend to manifest the self\n the gita and upanishads say a great deal about food because the mind is formed of the subtle essence of food\n vegetarian diet is a cornerstone of humanity and a necessary factor in the aspiration to divinity\n no serious aspirant can afford to ignore this or attempt to\n so the upanishad continues from food are born all creatures which live upon food and after death return to food\n food is the chief of all things\n it is therefore said to be medicine for all diseases of the body\n those who worship food as brahman gain all material objects\n from food are born all beings which being born grow by food\n all beings feed upon food and when they die food feeds upon them\n this is a great deal of mental food to digest but is well worth the effort\n food annam is not just something material that an organism subsists on but includes everything that goes to affect any sentient being\n thoughts and feelings are food and all life experiences are food\n of course some are positive and some are negative but they all go to feed the evolving consciousness\n but frankly if we don t start with the regulation of physical food we need not bother with the metaphysical food\n food physical and subtle is the medicine for all ills\n this the indian sages knew long before nutritionists or naturopaths existed\n i was fortunate to know a truly great man dr\n josef lenninger who could cure any disease with diet alone\n he was never wrong and he never failed to cure anyone who followed his instructions\n he even saved people s lives people that i knew\n diet is everything this i learned from him much better than from any yogi\n when we realize that brahman is the ultimate food then our spiritual health is assured\n when we live in harmony with brahman all good comes to us on all levels of our existence\n just as bodies are absorbed in the earth from which they and their food came so finally we are absorbed into our original source to life forever in the greatest sense\n the bodies of the bodiless different from the physical sheath is the vital sheath\n this is encased in the physical sheath and has the same form\n through this the senses perform their office\n from this men and beasts derive their life\n this determines the length of life of all creatures\n he who worships the vital sheath as brahman lives to complete his span of life\n this sheath is the living self of the physical sheath\n different from the vital sheath is the mental sheath\n this is encased in the vital sheath and has the same form\n just as god has encased himself in various layers of manifestation so has the self\n so knowledge of these sheaths koshas is worthwhile\n the pranic and mental manasic bodies inside the physical body is the pranic body the body of life force\n wiyout the pranic body the physical body cannot live\n the pranic body is also the most objective astral body and when seen looks just like the physical body\n at death the grossest part of the pranic body remains which is why the hair and fingernails grow for a while after death\n when it separates from the physical body at death the pranic body takes on the appearance it had when strongest usually as the person looked in early middle age\n when projected from the physical while the person still lives in embodiment however it looks just like the physical body at that time\n within the pranic body the currents of life force move in subtle channels that correspond to the physical nerves\n in sanskrit both the physical and pranic nerves are called nadis\n the pranic body draws its substance from food sunlight and air\n this latter is one of the reasons yogis pay attention to both diet and breathing\n health of the pranic body can produce health of the material body\n the pranic body does indeed determine both the health and the length of life of the physical body\n prana is the very life of god in manifestation so we live in and by the divine life\n in a sense the pranic body is the self of the physical\n it is the link between the physical sense organs and the sensory mind or manas which is the mental sheath spoken of next\n this body also has the form of the embodied person but is more radiant than the pranic sheath\n it too is astral and draws a great deal of its vitality from the pranic body\n their limitation these three bodies are mostly integrated with earthly experience that is their purpose\n for this reason they perceive only the slightest hints of spiritual being of spirit itself\n therefore the upanishad interposes this statement words cannot express the bliss of brahman mind cannot reach it\n the sage who knows it is freed from fear\n this is tremendous information for the yogi\n first it tells him that any words about brahman and brahman experience are worthless even deceptive since it cannot be spoken about nor can the sensory mind perceive brahman in its pure being\n next it tells him that those who know this truth will be freed from great fear and doubts\n this is because ignorant people continually mistake physical pranic and mental phenomena for spiritual phenomena then when the flaws and sometimes outright false character of those phenomena are discovered the sincere seeker is thrown into doubt fear and confusion\n disillusionment with these things sometimes cause the person to forsake spiritual life altogether\n of course spiritual life is impossible on those levels so they never really had one but they aspired to do so\n we are being warned by the upanishad to not make similar mistakes\n the yogi must continually live higher than these three levels\n he must realize that they are delusive to a high degree\n nevertheless they are vehicles of the divine self and must be cared for\n the mental sheath is the living self of the vital sheath\n the mental sheath draws much of its power from the pranic sheath as i said but it greatly controls the pranic sheath and empowers it by directing it\n for example when the sensory mind sees attractive food it stimulates the pranic sheath to begin the process of physical digestion\n when it perceives something pleasant the two other bodies are likewise affected and when it perceives something fearful or lifethreatening its effects are sometimes cataclysmic\n the intellectual body different from the mental sheath is the intellectual sheath\n this is encased in the mental sheath and has the same form\n all actions sacrificial or otherwise are performed through the intellect\n all the senses pay homage to the intellectual sheath\n he who worships intellect as brahman does not err he does not identify himself with the other sheaths and does not yield to the passions of the body\n now the upanishad speaks of the jnanamaya kosha the intellectual sheath that is also called the buddhi the intellect\n this controls the three lower sheaths through intelligent understanding\n light strikes the eye and imprints an image of a tree on the retina the nerves physical and pranic convey impulses to the physical and astral brains the intellect perceives it and says that is a tree a maple tree\n wiyout this function of the buddhi we would not be human beings at all\n the intellectual sheath is not astral but causal\n if we saw it we would see light usually formless but on the lesser levels it could have the general outline of the human body\n the senses are messengers to the intellect its servants actually\n the wise yogi does not identify himself with the other sheaths but centers his awareness in and directs his life mostly from the buddhi\n as a result he does not yield to the passions of the body\n surely the buddhi is woryour of reverence\n the will body different from the intellectual sheath is the sheath of the ego\n this sheath is encased in the intellectual sheath and has the same form\n the completion of the body complex is the highest body the anandamaya kosha which is the seat of will and the sense of asmita i exist\n the intellect may know it is seeing a tree but the will decides whether or not to keep looking at it\n in this way it fully controls the lesser levels\n it both brings them into function and stops their actions\n just as the buddhi makes us intelligent human beings the willbody makes us effective human beings\n the anandamaya kosha is the subtlest causal level so subtle that it touches and partakes of the nature of the spirit self\n functionally speaking it is a mixture of subtle energy and pure consciousness yough it is not really since beyond all sheaths is the self\n sometimes we have to speak inaccurately to get across at least a shadow of higher realities\n karma all intelligent yought and action are possible because of the buddhi and the will\n so they are really the seat of karma\n that is why buddha taught that intention determined the nature of karma more than the act that a person who accidentally brought about the death of another would not be a murderer\n someone who gives poison to an ill person fully believing that it is medicine is not guilty of taking life\n ultimately karma is a matter of the will for it is the basis of action\n all together these five bodies correspond to the five elements earth water fire air and ether\n they also correspond to five levels of existence bhuh bhuvah swah maha and jana lokas\n according to which body we mostly live in determines what world loka we will incarnate in after this life\n fortunately for the yogi he steps beyond these five bodies and cultivates awareness of the self\n so at death the skilled yogi goes to tapa loka the world of those who are consciously evolving themselves\n hopefully he will not return to earthly birth but will continue on from there to the highest world satya loka the realm of the liberated ones who know brahman\n brahman and belief beyond the sheaths is the self and beyond the self as its inmost being is brahman\n brahman is the basis of all and is all as the upanishad will soon discuss\n this being so vain and useless becomes his life who thinks of brahman as nonexistent\n he alone who knows brahman as existent truly lives\n interestingly the upanishad literally says if anyone knows brahman as non existent he himself becomes non existent\n how many times do people know something that is completely wrong\n our belief in god must not be based on our ignorant mind like the unbelief of the atheist\n i have known of people who became atheists when tragedy entered their lives and i have known people who became believers when tragedy came into their lives\n neither their unbelief nor their belief really amounted to anything\n people who come to believe in god as a kind of last resort are like conquered enemies not free and loyal citizens of the kingdom of god\n we should not believe in god we should know that god exists\n there is a deep intuition of the existence of god in each one of us that comes from our spirit self\n but because of the mental debris we have accumulated in this and prior lives it has become greatly attenuated distorted or even obliterated\n an external factor can sometimes shift the debris pile to let some light through but how long will it be before other things shift it back the only really safe and sure way is to practice meditation and burn up the things that are obscuring our intuition of spirit\n then we will be knowers of the existence of brahman and well on the way to becoming knowers of brahman\n our minds possess the same creative power as the divine mind yough to a finite degree\n nonetheless our mind determines our entire life the whole course of our evolution in this and all higher worlds\n it does rest squarely on us\n remember what sri ramakrishna said the mind is everything\n god has created the playing field and supplied all the equipment for the game\n but how we play is up to us none else\n if we do not know either the goal of the game or the way it is played it is hopeless\n as the upanishad says the life of one who does not believe in god is vain and useless\n but if we know the goal the rules and the way to play then we will play well truly live as the upanishad says\n the only reason for the universe is the attainment of brahmajnana\n so the upanishad finally says surely at death a foolish man does not attain brahman but only a wise man\n taittiriya upanishad b brahman creation and us brahman and creation now we are ready for the subject of the creation and its implications for both god and human beings\n desiring that he should become many that he should make of himself many forms brahman meditated\n meditating he created all things\n creating all things he entered into everything\n entering into all things he became that which has shape and that which is shapeless he became that which can be defined and that which cannot be defined he became that which has support and that which has not support he became that which is conscious and that which is not conscious he became that which is gross and that which is subtle\n he became all things whatsoever therefore the wise call him the real\n desiring that he should become many that he should make of himself many forms brahman meditated\n meditating he created all things\n certainly the one cannot become two much less many\n but he can experience multiplicity through his omniscience\n so he willed and all things came into being through his innate omnipotence\n but it was totally an ideational process\n the cosmic dreamer projected the cosmic dream\n then creating all things he entered into everything\n entering into all things he became all things whatsoever therefore the wise call him the real\n pervading all things through his omnipresence he became aware of them and experienced being them just as in dream we take on many identities and forms that constantly change until we awaken\n brahman in contrast is always awake and knows what is and is not\n there is nothing that brahman has not become described and indescribable sentient and insentient\n brahman is all things\n swami gambhirananda s more literal translation brings about a point to be noted\n he wished let me be many let me be born\n the birthless actually undergoes birth\n and the same is true of us\n we have neither birth nor death\n experience is not reality this we must learn\n concerning which truth it is written before creation came into existence brahman existed as the unmanifest\n from the unmanifest he created the manifest\n from himself he brought forth himself\n hence he is known as the self existent\n gambhirananda s more literal translation gives us a better idea in the beginning all this was but the unmanifested brahman \n from that emerged the manifested\n that brahman created itself by itself\n therefore it is called the self creator there is really no need for comment\n and us the self existent is the essence of all felicity\n who could live who could breathe if that blissful self dwelt not within the lotus of the heart he it is that gives joy\n taittiriya upanishad b gambhirananda that which is known as the self creator is verily the source of joy for one becomes happy by coming in contact with that source of joy\n who indeed will inhale and who will exhale if this bliss be not there in the supreme space within the heart \n this one indeed enlivens\n one becomes happy by coming in contact with that source of joy\n brahman is of the nature of bliss itself the source of joy to all beings\n it is clear and simple by coming in contact with that source of joy we will be joyful\n a lot of people are hyper and hysterical and some are so heedless and unaware that they are happy like village idiots\n but only those who consciously contact brahman through meditation are truly happy and have inner joy the only kind that is real and lasting\n seeking happiness in anything but god can only lead to unhappiness\n how many deliriously happy people have we seen ending up in what john bunyan calls the slough of despond in pilgrim s progress their false joy evaporates so very quickly\n then they go running after another mirage\n who indeed will inhale and who will exhale if this bliss be not there in the supreme space within the heart \n this part is of utmost importance to yogis for it indicates that the breath arises from the chidakasha the principle tattwa of conscious ether the abode of the self\n this is why all liberating yoga involves breath\n for if breath arises from the source it will take us to that supreme bliss if we understand how to work with it\n see the chapter breath and sound in meditation in om yoga\n knowing brahman this one indeed enlivens\n this is why just a few verses back the upanishad says vain and useless becomes his life who thinks of brahman as nonexistent\n he alone who knows brahman as existent truly lives\n this is bedrock truth\n that is why yoga is the path to life\n the persevering yogi experiences ever increasing life on all levels of his being\n the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day\n proverbs when a man finds his existence and unity in the self who is the basis of life who is beyond the senses who is formless inexpressible beyond all predicates then alone does he transcend fear\n so long as there is the least idea of separation from him there is fear\n to the man who thinks himself learned yet knows not himself as brahman brahman who drives away all fear appears as fear itself\n we reach fearlessness when we know our unity with the self and brahman\n to attain this fearlessness our consciousness must become more and more centered in that which is formless inexpressible beyond all predicates\n while living in this world we must inwardly dwell in the transcendent reality that is brahman that is our self\n for so long as there is the least idea of separation from him there is fear and with good cause\n the life separated from god is no life at all but a mirage of suffering change decay and death\n perhaps one of the saddest truths in any of the upanishads is this to the man who thinks himself learned yet knows not himself as brahman brahman who drives away all fear appears as fear itself\n we see this all the time\n intelligent people fear the idea of living in the state of unity with god lest they lose their individuality\n they cling to death and call it life while avoiding life as yough it were death\n how will they get out of that state only by a lot of buffeting by what they call life\n it is not god who punishes and forsakes us because of this wrong choice it is the false world that does so from life to life\n yet we grasp in desperation for more of its fake appearances and run from our only life\n in my early teens i spoke with a friend about how wonderful it was to free oneself of the good things of life and turn to the only life\n oh he exclaimed if i lived like that i would feel like i was in prison so he chose what the world told him was real living and now he is a broken miserable old man with nothing but alcoholism and sexual deviance as his companions\n he chose imprisonment and will no doubt do so in future lives for enslavement becomes a habit hard to break\n concerning which truth it is written through fear of brahman the wind blows and the sun shines through fear of him indra the god of rain agni the god of fire and yama the god of death perform their tasks\n the entire cosmos and all the processes of personal life take place through cognition of god and his purpose\n the fear spoken of here is awe which cancels out any possibility of defiance or disobedience\n in the human being there should be a clear understanding that since god is all life should be lived accordingly\n along with that should be the realization that god is our self that we are obeying our own nature in which is all joy but outside of which there can be nothing but fear\n measuring the joy in the seventh verse this question was set forth who could live who could breathe if that blissful self dwelt not within the lotus of the heart he it is that gives joy\n now the upanishad takes up that subject of the joy of the self\n of what nature is this joy consider the lot of a young man noble well read intelligent strong healyour with all the wealth of the world at his command\n assume that he is happy and measure his joy as one unit\n one hundred times that joy is one unit of the joy of gandharvas but no less joy than gandharvas has the seer to whom the self has been revealed and who is wiyout craving\n one hundred times the joy of gandharvas is one unit of the joy of celestial gandharvas but no less joy than celestial gandharvas has the sage to whom the self has been revealed and who is wiyout craving\n one hundred times the joy of celestial gandharvas is one unit of the joy of the pitris in their paradise but no less joy than the pitris in their paradise has the sage to whom the self has been revealed and who is wiyout craving\n one hundred times the joy of the pitris in their paradise is one unit of the joy of the devas but no less joy than the devas has the sage to whom the self has been revealed and who is wiyout craving\n one hundred times the joy of the devas is one unit of the joy of the karma devas but no less joy than the karma devas has the sage to whom the self has been revealed and who is wiyout craving\n one hundred times the joy of the karma devas is one unit of the joy of the ruling devas but no less joy than the ruling devas has the sage to whom the self has been revealed and who is wiyout craving\n one hundred times the joy of the ruling devas is one unit of the joy of indra but no less joy than indra has the sage to whom the self has been revealed and who is wiyout craving\n one hundred times the joy of indra is one unit of the joy of brihaspati but no less joy than brihaspati has the sage to whom the self has been revealed and who is wiyout craving\n one hundred times the joy of brihaspati is one unit of the joy of prajapati but no less joy than prajapati has the sage to whom the self has been revealed and who is wiyout craving\n one hundred times the joy of prajapati is one unit of the joy of brahma but no less joy than brahma has the seer to whom the self has been revealed and who is wiyout craving\n joy comes from knowing the self and becoming free of all desire through the fulfillment that comes from union with brahman\n rising into joy he who is the self in man and he who is the self in the sun are one\n verily he who knows this truth overcomes the world he transcends the physical sheath he transcends the vital sheath he transcends the mental sheath he transcends the intellectual sheath he transcends the sheath of the ego\n this is the real ascension and only those who have done so are ascended masters\n just as god is untouched by all the worlds that have proceeded from him in the same way the liberated yogi cannot be affected by his various sheaths koshas his own private worlds\n it is written he who knows the joy of brahman which words cannot express and the mind cannot reach is free from fear\n he is not distressed by the yought why did i not do what is right why did i do what is wrong he who knows the joy of brahman knowing both good and evil transcends both\n he who knows brahman is freed from all karmic bonds and knows that what he did and did not do will no longer affect him either in the present or the future\n having transcended both good and bad karma he is free\n sri ramakrishna described such a person as being like a fish that had been caught in the net but has jumped out into freedom and swims joyfully away\n the ladder of understanding life is change nothing ever stands still\n when you do find something that is wiyout any kind of change then that thing is dead including a lot of religion\n a woryour spiritual aspirant is steady and unwavering in his aspiration and his endeavor but he is always changing for he is ever learning\n he continually sees things either differently or better than before\n to show us this the upanishad is giving the account of bhrigu s search for knowledge of brahman\n in the gita krishna says among the great sages i am bhrigu so this is a very important teaching that is being given us\n know brahman bhrigu respectfully approaching his father varuna said sir teach me brahman\n varuna explained to him the physical sheath and the vital sheath and the functions of the senses and added he from whom all beings are born in whom they live being born and to whom at death they return seek to know him\n it is absolutely necessary to know the territory in any endeavor whatever its kind\n if equipment is involved we must know and understand it thoroughly\n this is why oriental religions are so intent on the makeup of the human being\n first we have to be a conscious human before we can move on to the next level of evolution\n therefore varuna taught bhrigu about the gross and subtle bodies pointing out to him that all these have proceeded from brahman are reflections of brahman and that dealing with them is dealing with brahman in manifestation\n brahman is the totality of all being\n gambhirananda gives a better version of the latter part of this verse crave to know that from which all these beings take birth that by which the live after being born that towards which they move and into which they merge\n the first point is that we should not just seek to know brahman we must crave to know it there must be an intense hunger a sense of absolute necessity a life and death attitude behind us\n for that is the fuel that propels us onward to realization\n at the same time we are not going against the current but cooperating with the eternal flow for all beings move toward brahman through the many stages of evolution and eventually merge into brahman\n this is the only natural mode of life the only way of life which puts an end to all suffering and brings supreme fulfillment\n tapasya bhrigu practiced austerity and meditation\n then it seemed to him that food was brahman\n for of food all beings are born by food they are sustained being born and into food they enter after death\n this knowledge however did not sait isfy him\n he again approached his father varuna and said sir teach me brahman\n varuna replied seek to know brahman by meditation\n bhrigu was highly intelligent so his concept of food was not just what humans eat to stay alive\n rather as in the teachings of the prashna upanishad food is emblematic of anything that sustains or is assimilated to the evolving organism and the inner consciousness\n but even that did not sait isfy him for it was too here and now while reality is mostly transcendent\n varuna opened new vistas for him by saying that tapasya is brahman\n in a brief sanskrit glossary we find this definition tapasya austerity practical i\n result producing spiritual discipline spiritual force\n literally it means the generation of heat or energy but is always used in a symbolic manner referring to spiritual practice and its effect especially the roasting of karmic seeds the burning up of karma\n who else but brahman can incinerate the seeds of karma alyough tapasya includes specific methods of spiritual practice ultimately it is the power of release of transmutation into perfect being\n so tapasya in the highest sense is the active power of brahman that is brahman bringing about liberation moksha \n tapasya is brahman within us\n this should be the yogi s constant perspective\n but tapasya is the means not the end so the search continues\n it is necessary to realize this for some people meditate a bit get a little experience and think they are enlightened and know the mysteries of the universe\n but like bhrigu we must never be sait isfied\n sri ramakrishna told the following parable once upon a time a wood cutter went into a forest to cut wood\n suddenly he came upon a brahmachari a monk \n the brahmachari told him my good man go forward\n the woodcutter upon returning home began to think why did the brahmachari tell me to go forward a few days passed\n one day as he was sitting idly the words of the brahmachari came to mind\n then he said to himself today i will go further forward\n going into the forest and moving deeper he discovered innumerable sandalwood trees\n he felt happy and brought back cartloads of sandalwood\n and selling them in the market he became a rich man\n a few days passed and he remembered again that the brahmachari had said go forward\n he returned to the forest and advancing deeper discovered a silver mine near a river\n he had not even dreamt of it\n then he only mined silver and selling it made heaps of money\n a few more days passed\n and one day he yought the brahmachari did not tell me to go up to the silver mine alone\n he told me to go forward\n this time going across the river he discovered a gold mine\n then he yought ah that s why the brahmachari asked me to go forward\n again a few days afterwards he advanced further and saw heaps of diamonds and other gems\n then he became prosperous like the god of wealth himself\n therefore i say whatever you may do you will find better things if you go forward\n do not think that you have achieved all that is there because you felt a little inspired\n if you go still further you will find god\n primal energy prana bhrigu practiced meditation and learned that primal energy is brahman\n for from primal energy all beings are born by primal energy they are sustained being born and into primal energy they enter after death\n but bhrigu was still doubtful about his knowledge\n so he approached his father again and said sir teach me brahman\n varuna replied seek to know brahman by meditation\n the word here translated primal energy is really prana\n prana as used in this verse means the vishwaprana the universal life force that makes all things live\n it is energy but that particular energy that manifests as living things as well as the power of life itself\n mind bhrigu practiced meditation and learned that mind is brahman\n for from mind all beings are born by mind they are sustained being born and into mind they enter after death\n still doubtful he approached his father and said sir teach me brahman\n his father replied seek to know brahman by meditation\n the word translated mind is manas a which means the mind of the senses that which perceives the message of the senses\n it is like the screen on which images are projected\n for this reason it is very easy to confuse the mind with consciousness indeed with the self\n but that is not so\n intellect bhrigu practiced meditation and learned that intellect is brahman\n for from intellect all beings are born by intellect they are sustained being born and into intellect they enter after death\n not yet sait isfied doubting his understanding bhrigu approached his father and said sir teach me brahman\n varuna replied seek to know brahman by meditation\n the word translated intellect is vijnana\n this is one of those instances in which the sanskrit has more than one meaning and they are all intended\n first vijnana means the buddhi the intellect which is superior to the manas the merely sensory mind\n the buddhi is the intelligent thinking mind the faculty that hopefully marks humans out from lesser evolved life forms\n since the cosmos is intelligence it is easy to equate the buddhi with that but it is not so\n the other meaning of vijnana is supreme knowledge supreme wisdom and supreme realization the knowing that transcends mere intellectual knowing\n it is the direct intuitive knowing of the spirit\n this is so exalted that no one can be faulted for assuming it is the highest\n but it is not so joy bhrigu practiced meditation and learned that joy is brahman\n for from joy all beings are born by joy they are sustained being born and into joy they enter after death\n this is the wisdom which bhrigu taught by varuna attained within his heart\n he who attains this wisdom wins glory grows rich enjoys health and fame\n ananda is the word translated here as joy\n ananda means bliss supreme happiness joy and delight\n it is a very dynamic experience for brahman is defined as bliss ananda \n so to experience this supreme bliss paramananda is to be united with brahman for brahman is that bliss\n some reflections this account of bhrigu s ascent to brahman knowledge has some very instructive points\n first no one needed to tell bhrigu that he had not really found brahman his meditation produced intuition told him that\n so he was not deluded by any experience he had rather the experience led him onward of itself\n of course all along he was intuiting brahman but only partially and he knew that\n and he knew when he finally had attained to complete realization purnananda the perfect total bliss\n equally important is the fact that varuna never comments on bhrigu s experience or conclusions but just keeps telling him to engage in tapasya\n this is the way of the true masters\n they do not waste the aspirants time with hours and hours of theoretical philosophy but urge them to find out the truth for themselves through the practice of yoga\n this is the glory of yoga it will reveal everything in time\n it must also not be overlooked that perfection in yoga brings about abundance in this world as well\n many are the yogis who live simply and frugally but that is their choice the treasurehouse of the world is open to them\n final teachings swami prabhavananda skips some verses that are little more than a tedious recap of the food part that has gone before and comes directly to the meaningful verses at the very end brahman is to be meditated upon as the source of all yought and life and action\n we must know that brahman is all\n he is the splendor in wealth he is the light in the stars\n he is all things\n let a man meditate upon brahman as support and he will be supported\n let him meditate upon brahman as greatness and he will be great\n let him meditate upon brahman as mind and he will be endowed with intellectual power\n let him meditate upon brahman as adoration and he will be adored\n let him worship brahman as brahman and he will become brahman\n he who is the self in man and he who is the self in the sun are one\n to know brahman is to know our self as well enabling us to exclaim i am that self i am life immortal i overcome the world i who am endowed with golden effulgence those who know me achieve reality\n anyone who knows who a realized person is knows himself also\n this is the true value of meeting those who are liberated it furthers our own liberation",

being deliberated on his i\n virat mouth parted just as an egg does\n from the mouth emerged speech from speech came fire\n the nostrils parted from the nostrils came out the sense of smell from the sense of smell came vayu air \n the two eyes parted from the eyes emerged the sense of sight from the sense of sight came the sun\n the two ears parted from the ears came the sense of hearing from the sense of hearing came the directions\n the skin emerged from the skin came out hair i\n the sense of touch associated with hair from the sense of touch came the herbs and trees\n the heart took shape from the heart issued the internal organ mind from the internal organ came the moon\n the navel parted from the navel came out the organ of ejection from the organ of ejection issued death\n the seat of the procreative organ parted from that came the procreative organ from the procreative organ came out water\n these deities that had been created fell into this vast ocean\n he subjected him i\n virat to hunger and thirst\n they said to him i\n to the creator provide an abode for us staying where we can eat food\n for them he i\n god brought a cow\n they said this one is not certainly adequate for us\n for them he brought a horse\n they said this one is not certainly adequate for us\n for them he brought a man\n they said this one is well formed man indeed is a creation of god himself \n to them he said enter into your respective abodes \n fire entered into the mouth taking the form of the organ of speech air entered into the nostrils assuming the form of the sense of smell the sun entered into the eyes as the sense of sight the directions entered into the ears by becoming the sense of hearing the herbs and trees entered into the skin in the form of hair i\n the sense of touch the moon entered into the heart in the shape of the mind death entered into the navel in the form of apana i\n the vital energy that presses down water entered into the limb of generation in the form of semen i\n the organ of procreation \n to him hunger and thirst said provide for us some abode \n to them he said i provide your livelihood among these very gods i make you share in their portions\n therefore when oblation is taken up for any deity whichsoever hunger and thirst become verily sharers with that deity\n he yought this then are the senses and the deities of the senses\n let me create food for them\n he deliberated with regard to the water\n from the water thus brooded over evolved a form\n the form that emerged was verily food\n this food that was created turned back and attempted to run away\n he tried to take it up with speech\n he did not succeed in taking it up through speech\n if he had succeeded in taking it up with the speech then one would have become contented merely by talking of food\n he tied to grasp that food with the sense of smell\n he did not succeed in grasping it by smelling\n if he had succeeded in grasping it by smelling then everyone should have become contented merely by smelling food\n he wanted to take up the food with the eye\n he did not succeed in taking it up with the eye\n if he had taken it up with the eye then one would have become sait isfied by merely seeing food\n he wanted to take up the food with the ear\n he did not succeed in taking it up with the ear\n if he had taken it up with the ear then one would have become sait isfied by merely by hearing of food\n he wanted to take it up with the sense of touch\n he did not succeed in taking it up with the sense of touch\n if he had taken it up with touch then one would have become been sait isfied merely by touching food\n he wanted to take it up with the mind\n he did not succeed in taking it up with the mind\n if he had taken it up with the mind then one would have become sait isfied by merely thinking of food\n he wanted to take it up with the procreative organ\n he did not succeed in taking it up with the procreative organ\n if he had taken it up with the procreative organ then one would have become sait isfied by merely ejecting food\n he wanted to take it up with apana\n this is the devourer of food\n that vital energy which is well known as dependent of food for its subsistence is this vital energy called apana \n he yought how indeed can it be there wiyout me he yought through which of the two ways should i enter he yought if utterance is done by the organ of speech smelling by the sense of smell seeing by the eye hearing by the ear feeling by the sense of touch thinking by the mind the act of drawing in or pressing down by apana ejecting by the procreative organ then who or what am i having split up this very end he entered through this door\n this entrance is known as vidriti the chief entrance \n hence it is delightful\n of him there are three abodes three states of dream\n this one is an abode this one is an abode\n this one is an abode\n being born he manifested all the beings for did he speak of or know anything else he realised this very purusha as brahman the most pervasive thus i have realised this \n therefore his name is idandra\n he is verily known as idandra\n alyough he is idandra they call him indirectly indra for the gods are verily fond of indirect names the gods are verily fond of indirect names\n in man indeed is the soul first conceived\n that which is the semen is extracted from all the limbs as their vigour\n he holds that self of his in his own self\n when he sheds it into his wife then he procreates it\n that is its first birth\n that becomes non different from the wife just as much as her own limb is\n therefore the foetus does not hurt her\n she nourishes this self of his that has entered here in her womb \n she the nourisher becomes fit to be nourished\n the wife bears that embryo before the birth \n he the father protects the son at the very start soon after his birth\n that he protects the son at the very beginning just after birth thereby he protects his own self for the sake of the continuance of these worlds\n for thus is the continuance of these worlds ensured\n that is his second birth\n this self of his viz\n the son is substituted by the father for the performance of virtuous deeds\n then this other self of his that is the father of the son having got his duties ended and having advanced in age departs\n as soon as he departs he takes birth again\n that is his i\n the son s third birth\n this fact was stated by the seer i\n mantra even while lying in the womb i came to know of the birth of all the gods\n a hundred iron citadels held me down\n then like a hawk i forced my way through by dint of knowledge of the self \n vamadeva said this while still lying in the mother s womb\n he who had known thus had become identified with the supreme and attained all desirable things even here and having then ascended higher up after the destruction of the body he became immortal in the world of the self\n what is it that we worship as this self which of the two is the self is it that by which one sees or that by which one hears or that by which one smells odour or that by which one utters speech or that by which one tastes the sweet or the sour it is this heart intellect and this mind that were stated earlier\n it is sentience rulership secular knowledge presence of mind retentiveness sense perception fortitude thinking genius mental suffering memory ascertainment resolution life activities hankering passion and such others\n all these verily are the names of consciousness\n this one is the inferior brahman this is indra this is prajapati this is all these gods and this is these five elements viz\n earth air space water fire and this is all these big creatures together with the small ones that are the procreators of others and referable in pairs to wit those that are born of eggs of wombs of moisture of the earth viz\n horses cattle men elephants and all the creatures that there are which move or fly and those which do not move\n all these have consciousness as the giver of their reality all these are impelled by consciousness the universe has consciousness as its eye and consciousness is its end\n through this self that is consciousness he ascended higher up from this world and getting all desires fulfilled in that heavenly world he became immortal he became immortal\n om may my speech be based on i\n accord

that protect the speaker i\n the teacher may that protect me may that protect the speaker may that protect the speaker\n om peace peace peace here ends the aitareyopanishad as contained in the rig veda\n commentary on the aitereya upanishad by swami nirmalananda giri the worlds and the self in his translations of some upanishads swami prabhavananda omitted parts that were in such obscure language that any attempt at translation would really only be speculation\n he also omitted very repetitious passages and those that dwelt with matters irrelevant to the knowledge of brahman and the self\n i think that if you get complete translations of those you will see he was quite justified in this\n anyhow i am writing this to explain why in the references to the verses of this upanishad there will be some jumping around\n the worlds before creation all that existed was the self the self alone\n then the self yought\n let me send forth the worlds\n he sent forth these worlds ambhas the highest world above the sky and upheld by it marichi the sky mara the mortal world the earth and apa the world beneath the earth\n several times in the upanishads we are told that when nothing else existed brahman was and from brahman proceeded all the worlds\n but in these opening verses of the aitareya upanishad the word atman self is used instead of brahman\n this is fitting for two reasons first because brahman is the ultimate self of all\n second because what occurred on the cosmic level in relation to brahman has occurred on the microcosmic level with each one of us with each individual self that has entered into the field of relative existence\n just as the various worlds or lokas have emanated from brahman so the several bodies or koshas have emanated from the individual self\n the upanishad lists four worlds that are also levels of existence\n ambhas is the highest world\n it lies beyond the material realm\n marichi is space itself in which many suns and planets are to be found\n for this reason the upanishad uses the plural term marichis but it is correct to use the singular word since it means the entire cosmos\n mara is not just planet earth but any planet on which sentient beings live\n mara means death and it is applied to the planets because all beings that live there are mortal\n apa is the name of the submaterial regions from which atomic matter rises\n these worlds have a more metaphysical meaning as well\n ambhas is the causal world marichi is the astral world mara is the physical world and apa is the region where those of low evolution go for a time after death usually in a kind of sleep\n in later indian cosmology the non material worlds are divided into those that are beneath the earth plane and those that are above the earth plane\n the realms beneath are the regions where animals and low evolved humans go between incarnations\n these worlds include the negative regions we call hells\n apa embraces all these\n the realms above are where normal human beings go between lives and include the world humans graduate into when they no longer need evolution on the material place\n these are the astral and causal worlds marichi and ambhas\n the worlds have a psychological meaning as well\n ambhas is the superconscious mind marichi is the higher intelligence or buddhi mara is the sensory earth centered mind or consciousness and apa is the subconscious mind\n these classifications particularly apply to the individual self of each one of us\n their guardians he yought behold the worlds\n let me now send forth their guardians\n then he sent forth their guardians\n he yought behold these worlds and the guardians of these worlds\n let me send forth food for the guardians\n then he sent forth food for them\n the word used here for guardians is lokapala\n a lokapala is the ruler or custodian of a world loka \n at the beginning of creation each world was assigned an overseer or guardian\n these are beings who have evolved to the status of gods and sometimes are mistaken for the absolute by those within those worlds whose understanding is imperfect\n nevertheless to approach them is beneficial for they will themselves reveal their limited nature and point questing souls to brahman the infinite\n the lokapalas are like gardeners for they work with living things and their development as well as their safety\n actually the picture of adam in the bible is very similar he was to supervise and foster all forms of life plant and animal\n many ancient scriptures contain partial or garbled accounts that were once expositions of wisdom\n but the centuries have altered and even eroded them\n the upanishad is speaking of the beginning of things\n so immediately after the manifestation of the worlds the lokapalas were awakened and made aware of their assignments for their work is part of their personal evolutionary process\n it is this work and the furnishings of the worlds that are their food\n now the same thing happens with us\n we are the custodians of our private worlds or bodies\n and our experiences through those bodies and the development we gain are our food just as it is for the lokapalas\n entering the worlds he yought how shall there be guardians and i have no part in them if wiyout me speech is uttered breath is drawn eye sees ear hears skin feels mind thinks sex organs procreate then what am i he yought let me enter the guardians\n whereupon opening the center of their skulls he entered\n the door by which he entered is called the door of bliss\n this narrative is more instructive than literally accurate\n first of all there is nothing that is not a manifestation of brahman\n it is not possible for brahman to enter into anything for it is always everywhere\n but the upanishad is teaching us as we teach children piecemeal and partially\n the idea here is that brahman is enlivening and enabling all beings from the lokapalas down to the least evolved of sentient beings\n these two verses are more individual than cosmic however and refer to us mostly\n our lokapalas are the various faculties of the mind that administer the different levels of our being as humans\n brahman is as i said always present but this verse speaks of the entry of the individual consciousness into the human complex when it incarnates as a human being\n the self enters through the psychic center or energy whorl called the brahmarandhra the aperture of brahman and from there administers its private cosmos a god within its finite universe\n according to yogis when we leave our body we go out through the gate chakra that corresponds to our dominant state of consciousness\n those who are depart through the brahmarandhra\n others leave through the lower centers\n within the three states of consciousness the self being unknown all three states of the soul are but dreaming waking dreaming and dreamless sleep\n in each of these dwells the self the eye is his dwelling place while we wake the mind is his dwelling place while we dream the lotus of the heart is his dwelling place while we sleep the dreamless sleep\n this is quite simple if the self is not known then even our waking is only a sleeping and dreaming\n there is a lot of going around and around about the question of the reality of the world\n but the upanishad gives us a quite simple answer to those that sleep not knowing the self the world is unreal to those that are awake in the knowledge of the self the world is real for the world is the self\n this is the frame of reference buddha had when meeting a brahmin after his liberation when the brahman asked who are you he replied i am awake\n therefore having entered into the guardians he identified himself with them\n he became many individual beings\n now therefore if an individual awake from his threefold dream of waking dreaming and dreamless sleep he sees no other than the self\n he sees the self dwelling in the lotus of his heart as brahman omnipresent and he declares i know brahman this is both the beginning and the end\n more on the self the four closing verses of the upanishad need little comment\n they begin who is this self whom we desire to worship of what nature is this self is he the self by which we see form hear sound smell odor speak words and taste the sweet or the bitter is he the heart and the mind by which we perceive command discriminate know think remember will feel desire breathe love and perform other like acts nay these are but adjuncts of the self who is pure consciousness\n this is extremely important for us since it is only natural that we would mistake these various faculties for the self for they are functions of consciousness yough not consciousness itself\n and this self who is pure consciousness is brahman\n he is god all gods the five elements earth air fire water ether all beings great or small born of eggs born from the womb born from heat born from soil horses cows men elephants birds everything that breathes the beings that walk and the beings that walk not\n the reality behind all these is brahman who is pure consciousness\n aitareya upanishad this takes us a very necessary step further even those things that are not brahman itself in the purest sense in another sense are brahman and to be regarded as such\n this is a bit like telling us to go two ways at the same time something impossible for the ordinary mind but quite easy and natural for the yogi s mind\n swami gambhirananda s rendering of the last part of this verse is very revealing all these have consciousness as the giver of their reality all these are impelled by consciousness prajna the universe has consciousness as its eye and consciousness is its end\n surely the upanishads are unparalleled in their beauty and profound teaching\n all these while they live and after they have ceased to live exist in him\n the sage vamadeva having realized brahman as pure consciousness departed this life ascended into heaven obtained all his desires and achieved immortality\n and so shall we",
    "Chandogya": "om let my limbs and speech prana eyes ears vitality and all the senses grow in strength\n all existence is the brahman of the upanishads\n may i never deny brahman nor brahman deny me\n let there be no denial at all let there be no denial at least from me\n may the virtues that are proclaimed in the upanishads be in me who am devoted to the atman may they reside in me\n om peace peace peace one should meditate on the syllable om the udgitha for one sings the udgitha beginning with om\n of this the explanation follows\n the essence of all these beings is the earth\n the essence of the earth is water\n the essence of water is vegetation\n the essence of vegetation is man\n the essence of man is speech\n the essence of speech is rik\n the essence of rik is saman\n the essence of saman is udgitha\n the syllable om which is called udgitha is the quintessence of the essences the supreme deserving of the highest place and the eighth\n which one is rik which one is saman which one is udgitha this is being considered now\n speech alone is rik\n the syllable om is udgitha\n speech and prana the sources of rik and saman taken together form a couple\n this couple is joined together in the syllable om\n whenever a couple come together they indeed fulfil each other s desire\n he who meditates upon this syllable as udgitha knowing it thus as the fulfiller verily becomes a fulfiller of all the desirable ends\n that verily is the syllable of assent for whenever one assents to a thing one says only om \n assent alone is prosperity\n he who meditates upon this syllable as udgitha knowing it thus as endowed with the quality of prosperity verily becomes one who increases all the desirable ends\n with this does the threefold knowledge proceed because with om does one cause to listen with om does one recite with om does one sing aloud\n for the worship of this syllable with its own greatness and essence the vedic rites are performed \n he who knows it thus and he who does not know both perform actions with it\n for knowledge and ignorance are different in their results \n whatever is performed with knowledge faith and meditation becomes more effective\n up to this truly is the explanation of the greatness of this syllable om\n once upon a time the gods and the demons both descendants of prajapati were engaged in a fight\n in that fight the gods performed the rites of the udgatir priests resolving with this we shall defeat them \n then they meditated on the deity of prana connected with the nose as udgitha the demons pierced it with evil\n therefore with it the nose one smells both the fragrant and the foul for it has been pierced with evil\n then they meditated on the deity of speech as udgitha the demons pierced it with evil\n therefore with it one speaks both truth and untruth for it has been pierced with evil\n then they meditated on the deity of eye as udgitha the demons pierced it with evil\n therefore with the eye one sees both the sightly and the unsightly for it has been pierced with evil\n then they meditated on the deity of ear as udgitha the demons pierced it with evil\n therefore with the ear one hears both the pleasant and the unpleasant for it has been pierced with evil\n then they meditated on the deity of mind as udgitha the demons pierced it with evil\n therefore with the mind one thinks both good and evil youghts for it has been pierced with evil\n then they meditated on the prana in the mouth as udgitha\n the demons came in clash with it and were destroyed just as a lump of clay is destroyed striking against a hard rock\n thus it is that the prana in the mouth has not been destroyed and is pure\n even as a lump of clay striking against a hard rock is destroyed so will he be destroyed who wishes to do evil to one who knows this the purity of prana or who actually injures that knower for he is like a hard rock\n with this prana in the mouth one discerns neither sweet smell nor foul for it is free from sin\n what one eats or drinks through this even with that he maintains the other pranas\n and not finding this at the time of death the prana in the mouth and its dependants depart and thus indeed one opens the mouth at the time of death\n angiras meditated on that prana as udgitha\n the sages consider this alone as angirasa which is the essence of the limbs\n so brihaspati meditated on prana as udgitha\n the sages consider this alone as brihaspati for speech is great and this prana is its lord\n so ayasya meditated on prana as udgitha identifying it with himself \n the sages consider this alone as ayasya for it goes out of the mouth\n baka the son of dalbha knew it thus\n so he became the udgatir singer of the sacrificers dwelling in naimisa\n for their sake he sang to fulfil their desires\n he who knows it thus and meditates on the udgitha as the syllable om looking upon it as prana certainly becomes the singer and procurer of the desired objects\n this is the meditation with reference to the body\n now the meditation on the udgitha with reference to the gods is described\n one should meditate on him who gives heat i\n the sun as udgitha\n verily when he rises he sings aloud for the sake of all creatures\n when he rises he dispels darkness and fear\n verily he who knows the sun as being endowed with these qualities becomes the dispeller of darkness and the consequent fear\n this prana in the mouth and that sun are the same\n this is warm and that is warm\n people call this as svara that is going and that as svara and pratyasvara that is going and coming \n therefore one should meditate on this prana and that sun as udgitha\n now verily one should meditate on vyana as udgitha\n that which one breathes out is prana and that which one breathes in is apana\n the junction of prana and apana is vyana\n that which is vyana even that is speech\n therefore one utters speech while one neither breathes out nor breathes in\n that which is speech even that is rik\n therefore while one neither breathes out nor breathes in one pronounces the rik\n that which is rik even that is saman\n therefore while one neither breathes out nor breathes in one sings the saman\n that which is saman even that is udgitha\n therefore while one neither breathes out nor breathes in one sings the udgitha\n therefore whatever other actions require strength such as the kindling of fire by friction running a race towards a goal the bending of a strong bow are all performed while one neither breathes out nor breathes in\n for this reason one should meditate on vyana as udgitha\n now one should meditate on the syllables of udgitha namely the syllables ut gi and tha \n prana is ut because through prana one arises ut it isthati \n speech is gi because speech is called word girah \n food is tha because upon food all this is established sthitam \n heaven is ut the sky is gi the earth is tha\n the sun is ut the air gi the fire tha\n the sama veda is ut the yajur veda gi the rig veda tha\n for him speech yields the milk which is the benefit of speech\n and he becomes rich in food and an eater of food who knows thus and meditates on the syllables of udgitha namely ut gi and tha\n now follows the fulfilment of wishes one should meditate on the objects contemplated\n one should reflect upon saman by means of which one proceeds to sing the stotra\n one should reflect upon the rik in which that saman occurs upon the sage by whom it is intuited and upon the deity to whom he proceeds to pray\n one should reflect upon the metre in which he proceeds to sing a stotra and he should reflect upon the hymn with which he proceeds to sing it\n he should reflect upon the quarter of heaven towards which he proceeds to sing a stotra\n lastly having yought about himself he should sing a stotra reflecting upon his desired object avoiding all faults\n very quickly will be fulfilled for him the desire desiring which he may sing the stotra yea desiring which he may sing the stotra\n one should meditate on the syllable om the udgitha for one sings the udgitha beginning with om\n of this the explanation follows\n verily the gods being afraid of death took refuge in the three vedas\n they covered themselves with the metrical hymns\n because they covered themselves with these the metrical hymns are called chandas\n just as a fisherman would see a fish in water so did death observe the gods in the rites connected with rik saman and yajus\n they too knowing this arose from the rik saman and yajus and entered the svara the syllable om \n verily when one learns the rik he loudly pronounces om \n it is the same with saman and with yajus\n this syllable om is indeed svara it again is immortality and fearlessness\n having entered into svara i\n having meditated the gods became immortal and fearless\n he who worships this syllable knowing it thus enters this syllable the svara which is immortality and fearlessness\n and having entered it he becomes immortal by that nectar by which the gods became immortal\n now that which is udgitha is verily pranava and that which is pranava is udgitha\n the yonder sun is udgitha and also pranava for he moves along pronouncing om \n to him the sun itself i sung therefore you are my only son thus said kausitaki to his son\n reflect upon the udgitha as the rays of the sun then surely you will have many sons\n this is the meditation with reference to the gods\n now is the meditation with reference to the body one should meditate on him who is this prana in the mouth as udgitha for he moves along pronouncing om \n to him the prana itself did i sing therefore you are my only son thus said kausitaki to his son\n i shall get many sons thinking thus sing praise to the udgitha as the manifold pranas\n now that which is udgitha is verily pranava and that which is pranava is udgitha so one should think\n as a result of it even if he chants wrongly he rectifies it by the act done from the seat of the hotr priest\n the earth is rik the fire is saman\n this saman rests upon that rik\n therefore the saman is sung as resting upon the rik\n the earth is sa the fire is ama and that makes sama \n the sky is rik the air is sama\n this saman rests upon that rik\n therefore the saman is sung as resting upon the rik\n the sky is sa the air is ama and that makes sama \n heaven is rik the sun is saman\n this saman rests upon that rik\n therefore the saman is sung as resting upon the rik\n heaven is sa the sun is ama and that makes sama \n the stars are rik the moon is saman\n this saman rests upon that rik\n therefore the saman is sung as resting upon the rik\n the stars are sa the moon is ama and that makes sama \n now the while light of the sun is rik the blue light that is extremely dark is saman\n this saman rests upon that rik\n therefore the saman is sung as resting upon the rik\n again the white light of the sun is sa the blue light that is extremely dark is ama and that makes sama \n now that person effulgent as gold who is seen within the sun who is with golden beard and golden hair is exceedingly effulgent even to the very tips of his nails\n his eyes are bright like a red lotus\n his name is ut \n he has risen above all evils\n verily he who knows thus rises above all evils\n rik and saman are his two joints\n therefore he is udgitha\n because the priest is the singer of this ut he is the udgitha\n moreover he this person called ut controls the worlds which are above that sun as also the desires of the gods\n this is with reference to the gods\n now is the meditation with reference to the body speech is rik prana is sama\n this saman rests upon that rik\n therefore the saman is sung as resting upon the rik\n speech is sa prana is ama and that makes sama \n the eye is rik the self reflected in the eye is saman\n this saman rests upon that rik\n therefore the saman is sung as resting upon the rik\n the eye is sa the self is ama and that makes sama \n the ear is rik the mind is saman\n this saman rests upon that rik\n therefore the saman is sung as resting upon the rik\n the ear is sa the mind is ama and that makes sama \n now the white light of the eye is rik the blue light that is extremely dark is saman\n this saman rests upon that rik\n therefore the saman is sung as resting upon the rik\n the white light of the eye is sa the blue light that is extremely dark is ama and that makes sama \n now this person who is seen within the eye he indeed is rik he is saman he is uktha he is yajus he is the vedas\n the form of this person seen in the eye is the same as the form of that person seen in the sun \n his joints are the same as those of the other his name is the same as that of the other\n that person in the eye is the lord of all the worlds that are extended below as also of the desired objects of men\n so those who sing on the lute sing of him alone and thereby become endowed with wealth\n now he who sings the saman after knowing the deity udgitha thus sings to both\n through that person in the sun he that singer gets the worlds beyond that sun and also the desired objects of gods\n similarly through this person in the eye one gets the worlds that are extended below this person and also the desired objects of men\n for this reason the udgatir priest who knows thus should ask the sacrificer what desire shall i obtain for you by singing the saman for he alone becomes capable of obtaining desires by singing who knowing thus sings the saman yea sings the saman\n in ancient times there were three proficient in udgitha silaka the son of salavat caikitayana of the dalbhya family and pravahana the son of jivala\n they said we are proficient in udgitha\n if you agree let us enter on a discussion of udgitha \n let it be so saying this they sat down\n then pravahana jaivali said you two revered sirs speak first and i shall listen to the words of two brahmanas conversing \n then silaka salavatya said to caikitayana dalbhya if you permit i shall question you \n question said he\n silaka asked what is the essence of saman the tune said dalbhya \n what is the essence of the tune prana said dalbhya \n what is the essence of prana food said dalbhya \n what is the essence of food water said dalbhya \n what is the essence of water that heavenly world said dalbhya \n what is the essence of the world one cannot carry the saman beyond the heavenly world said dalbhya we locate the saman in the world of heaven for saman is praised as heaven \n then silaka salavatya said to caikitayana dalbhya o dalbhya your saman is not indeed established\n if someone one were to say your head shall fall down surely your head would fall down \n dalbhya will you permit me sir to learn this of you learn said silaka \n what is the essence of that heavenly world this earth said silaka what is the essence of this earth one cannot carry the saman beyond this world as its support said silaka we locate the saman in this world as its support for saman is extolled as the earth \n pravahana jaivali said to him o salavatya your sama really has a further end\n if someone now were to say your head shall fall down surely your head would fall down\n salavatya will you permit me sir to learn this of you learn said jaivali \n salavatya what is the essence of this world akasa said pravahana all these beings arise from akasa alone and are finally dissolved into akasa because akasa alone is greater than all these and akasa is the support at all times\n it is this udgitha which is progressively higher and better\n this again is endless\n he who knowing thus meditates upon the progressively higher and better udgitha obtains progressively higher and better lives and wins progressively higher and better worlds\n atidhanvan the son of sunaka having taught this to udarasandilya said as long as among your descendants this knowledge of the udgitha continues so long their life in this world will be progressively higher and better than ordinary lives\n and in that other world also their state will be similar \n he who knows and meditates thus his life in this world surely becomes progressively higher and better and so also his state in that other world yea in that other world\n when the crops in the kuru country had been destroyed by hailstorms there lived usasti the son of cakra with his young wife in a deplorable condition in the village of elephant drivers\n he begged food of an elephant driver while he was eating beans of an inferior quality\n the driver said to him there is no other food than what is set before me \n give me some of them said usasti\n the driver gave them to him and said here is drink at hand if you please then i shall be drinking what is defiled said usasti\n are not these beans also defiled unless i ate them i would surely not have survived said usasti but drinking is at my option \n usasti after he had eaten brought the remainder to his wife\n she had already obtained her food by alms so after receiving it she kept it by\n next morning while leaving the bed he said alas if i could get a little of food i could earn a little wealth\n there a king is going to institute a sacrifice he would appoint me to all the priestly offices \n his wife said to him well lord here are the beans given by you \n having eaten them he went off to that sacrifice which was being performed\n seeing the singing priests seated there he sat down near the singers in the place for singing the stotras\n and then he addressed the prastotir priest\n o prastotir if you sing the prastava wiyout knowing the deity that belongs to the prastava your head will fall down \n in the same manner he addressed the udgatir priest o udgatir if you sing the udgitha wiyout knowing the deity that belongs to the udgitha your head will fall down \n in the same manner he addressed the pratihartir priest o pratihartir if you sing the pratihara wiyout knowing the deity that belongs to the pratihara your head will fall down \n then they all sat down silently suspending their duties\n then the principal of the sacrifice said to him i should like to know you revered sir i am chakrayana usasti said he\n he said i searched for you revered sir for all these priestly offices but not finding you sir i have chosen others\n revered sir you yourself take up all the priestly offices for me \n be it so then let these same priests sing the hymns being permitted by me\n but you should give me as much wealth as you give them\n very well said the sacrificer\n then the prastotir priest approached him and said revered sir you said to me o prastotir if you sing the prastava wiyout knowing the deity that belongs to the prastava your head will fall down \n which is that deity prana said usasti all these movable and immovable beings merge in prana during dissolution and rise out of prana during creation \n this is the deity that belongs to the prastava\n if you sang the prastava wiyout knowing him after your having been warned thus by me your head would have fallen down\n then the udgatir priest approached him and said revered sir you said to me o udgatir if you sing the udgitha wiyout knowing the deity that belongs to the udgitha your head will fall down \n which is that deity the sun said usasti all these movable and immovable sing the praise of the sun when he has come up\n this is the deity that belongs to the udgitha\n if you sang the udgitha wiyout knowing him after your having been warned thus by me your head would have fallen down\n then the pratihartir priest approached him and said revered sir you said to me o pratihartir if you sing the pratihara wiyout knowing the deity that belongs to the pratihara your head will fall down \n which is that deity food said usasti all these movable and immovable beings live by partaking of food only\n this is the deity that belongs to the pratihara\n if you sang the pratihara wiyout knowing him after your having been warned thus by me your head would have fallen down\n therefore next begins the udgitha seen by the dogs\n once dalbhya baka called also maitreya glava went out of the village for the study of the vedas\n before him a white dog appeared and other dogs gathered around it and said revered sir please obtain food for us by singing we are hungry\n the white dog said to them come to me over here tomorrow morning\n the sage named dalbhya baka and maitreya glava kept watch there for them\n just as those who recite the stotras singing the bahispavamana hymn move along clasping one another s hand even so did the dogs move along\n then they sat down and began to pronounce him \n om let us eat om let us drink om may the sun who is god varuna prajapati and savitir bring us food here\n o lord of food bring food here yea bring it om verily this world is the syllable hau which is a stobha the air is the syllable hai the moon is the syllable atha the self is the syllable iha and the fire is the syllable i \n the sun is the syllable u which is a stobha invocation is the syllable e the visvadevas are the syllable auhoyi prajapati is the syllable him prana is the stobha svara food is the stobha ya and virat is the stobha vak \n the undefinable and variable thirteenth stobha is the syllable hum \n for him speech yields the milk which is the benefit of speech and he becomes richin food and an eater of food who thus knows this sacred doctrine of the samans yea knows the sacred doctrine of the samans\n surely the meditation on the whole saman is good\n anything that is good people call as saman anything that is not good as asaman\n thus when people say he approached him with saman then they say only this he approached him with a good motive \n and when they say he approached him with asaman then they say only this he approached him with an evil motive\n again people say oh this is saman for us when it is something good then they say only this oh this is good for us \n again they say oh this is asaman for us when it is not good then they say only this oh this is evil\n when one who knows it thus meditates on the saman as good all good qualities hasten towards him and serve him\n among the worlds one should meditate upon the saman as fivefold\n the earth is the syllable him the fire is prasrava the sky is udgitha the sun is pratihara and heaven is nidhana\n thus this meditation pertains to the higher worlds\n now among the lower worlds\n heaven is the syllable him the sun is prastava the sky is udgitha the fire is pratihara and the earth is nidhana\n the worlds in the ascending and descending lines belong to him\n who knowing it thus endowed with the quality of good meditates on the fivefold saman in the worlds\n one should meditate on the fivefold saman as rain\n the wind that precedes is the syllable him the cloud that is formed is prastava the shower is udgitha lightning and thunder are pratihara and the ceasing is nidhana\n it rains for him indeed he causes rain who knowing it thus meditates on the fivefold saman as rain\n one should meditate on the fivefold saman in all the waters\n when a cloud gathers it is the syllable him\n when it rains it is prastava\n those waters that flow to the east are udgitha\n those that flow to the west are pratihara\n the ocean is nidhana\n he who knowing it thus meditates on the fivefold saman in all the waters does not drown in water and he becomes rich in water\n one should meditate on the fivefold saman as the seasons the spring is the syllable him the summer is prastava the rainy season is udgitha the autumn is pratihara and the winter is nidhana\n he who knowing it thus meditates on the fivefold saman in the seasons him the seasons serve and he becomes rich in seasons\n one should meditate on the fivefold saman as the animals\n the goats are the syllable him the sheep are prastava the cows are udgitha the horses are pratihara and man is nidhana\n he who knowing it this meditates on the fivefold saman in animals to him animals belong and he becomes rich in animals\n one should meditate on the progressively higher and better fivefold saman as the senses the organ of smell is the syllable him the organ of speech is prastava the eye is udgitha the ear is pratihara and the mind is nidhana\n verily these are progressively higher and better\n he who knowing it thus meditates on the fivefold saman progressively higher and better in the senses to him belong progressively higher and better lives and he wins ever higher and better worlds\n so much for the meditation on the fivefold saman\n next is the meditation on the sevenfold saman\n one should meditate on the sevenfold saman as speech\n whatsoever in speech is hum that is the syllable him whatever is pra that is prastava whatever is a that is adi the first whatever is ut that is udgitha whatever is prati that is pratihara whetever is upa that is upadrava and whatever is ni that is nidhana\n he who knowing it thus meditates on the sevenfold whole saman as speech for him speech yields milk i\n its appropriate benefit and he becomes rich in food and an eater of food\n next one should meditate upon the sevenfold saman as the yonder sun\n he is the saman because he is always the same\n he is the saman because he is the same to all for each one thinks he faces me he faces me\n one should know that all these beings are dependent on him\n what he is before rising that is himkara\n on this the animals are dependent\n as they participate in the himkara part of this saman do they utter him before sunrise \n then the form of the sun when it has just risen that is prastava\n on this men are dependent\n as they participate in the prastava part of this saman so are they desirous of praise direct and indirect\n and the form of the sun as it appears at the time of the assembling of its rays that is adi\n on this the birds are dependent\n as they participate in the adi part of this saman so do they hold themselves unsupported in the sky and fly about\n next the form of the sun that appears just at midday that is udgitha\n on this the gods are dependent\n as they participate in the udgitha part of this saman so are they the best among the offsprings of prajapati\n next the form of the sun that appears just after midday and before the latter part of afternoon that is pratihara\n on this the foetuses are dependent\n as they participate in the pratihara part of this saman so are they held up in the womb and they do not fall down\n next the form of the sun that appears when it is past afternoon and before sunset that is upadrava\n on this the wild animals are dependent\n as they participate in the upadrava part of this saman so do they when they see a man run away to the forest as to a place of safety\n now the form of the sun that appears just after sunset that is nidhana\n on this the fathers are dependent\n as they participate in the nidhana part of this saman so do people lay them aside\n now verily one should meditate on the sevenfold saman which has all its parts similar and which leads beyond death\n himkara has three syllables prastava has three syllables\n so they are equal to each other\n adi has two syllables pratihara has four syllables\n we take one syllable from pratihara to adi\n so they are equal to each other\n udgitha has three syllables upadrava has four syllables\n three and three become equal\n one syllable is left over that really is tri syllabic so it also becomes equal\n nidhana has three syllables and this to is equal to the others \n these indeed are the twenty two syllables of the sevenfold saman \n he who knowing this saman thus as good meditates on the sevenfold saman which has all its parts similar and which leads beyond death reaches the sun death by the number twenty one for counting from this world the yonder sun is verily the twenty first\n with the remaining twenty second syllable he conquers the world beyond the sun\n that world is of the nature of bliss and is free from misery\n that is he obtains victory over the sun and then a victory still higher becomes his who meditates on the sevenfold saman\n the mind is himkara speech is prastava the eye is udgitha the ear is pratihara and the prana is nidhana\n this is the gayatra saman woven in the prana and the senses\n he who thus knows this gayatra saman as woven in the prana and the senses becomes the possessor of perfect senses reaches the full length of life lives gloriously becomes great with offspring and cattle and great also with fame\n his holy vow is that he should be high minded\n one rubs that is himkara\n the smoke is produced that is prastava\n it blazes that is udgitha\n the embers are formed that is pratihara\n it goes down that is nidhana\n it is completely extinguished that is nidhana\n this is the rathantara saman woven in fire\n he who thus knows this rathantara saman as woven in fire becomes radiant with the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom is endowed with good appetite and reaches the full length of life lives gloriously becomes great with offspring and cattle and great also with fame\n his holy vow is that he should neither sip nor spit facing the fire\n the vamadevya saman is woven in a couple\n he who thus knows this vamadevya saman as woven in a couple becomes one of the couple and procreates\n he reaches the full length of life lives gloriously becomes great with offspring and cattle and great also with fame\n his holy vow is that he should not despise any woman\n the rising sun is himkara the risen sun is prastava the midday sun is udgitha the sun in the afternoon is pratihara and the setting sun is nidhana\n this is the brihat

throughout his life mortifying his body in the teacher s house is the third\n all these become possessors of meritorious worlds but he who is established firmly in brahman attains immortality\n prajapati brooded on the worlds\n from them thus brooded upon issued forth the threefold veda as their essence \n he brooded on this\n from this thus brooded upon issued forth the syllables bhuh bhuvah and svah\n he brooded on them\n from them thus brooded upon issued forth as their essence the syllable om brahman \n just as all the parts of the leaf are permeated by the ribs of the leaf so are all the words permeated by the syllable om\n verily the syllable om is all this yea the syllable om is verily all this\n the expounders of brahman say the morning libation is of the vasus the midday libation is of the rudras and the third libation is of the adityas and of the visvadevas\n where the is the world of the sacrificer how can he who does not know this perform sacrifices it is only after knowing this that he should perform sacrifices \n before the commencement of the morning chant the sacrificer sits down behind the garhapatya fire facing the north and sings the saman sacred to the vasus o fire open the door of this world that we may see you for obtaining the kingdom\n then he offers the oblation with the mantra salutation to fire who dwells in the region of the

third libation\n he alone knows the real character of the sacrifice who knows thus\n the yonder sun indeed is the honey of the gods\n of this honey heaven is the cross beam the sky is the honey comb and the water particles in the rays are the eggs\n the eastern rays of that sun are its eastern honey cells the riks are the bees the ritual of the rig veda is the flower and those waters are the nectar\n those very riks the bees pressed this rigveda\n from it thus pressed issued forth as juice fame splendour of limbs alertness of the senses virility and food for eating\n that juice flowed forth it settled by the side of the sun\n verily this it is that appears as the red hue of the sun\n and its southern rays are its southern honey cells\n the yajus verses are the bees\n the yajurveda

meditations on the pranava are the nectar\n those secret teachings pressed this pranava\n from it thus pressed issued forth as juice fame splendour of limbs alertness of the senses virility and food for eating\n it flowed forth it settled by the side of the sun\n verily this it is that appears as the quivering in the middle of the sun\n verily these hues are the juice of the juices for the vedas are the essences and these are their essence\n these hues indeed are the nectar of the nectars for the vedas are the nectar and these are their nectar\n that which is the first nectar i\n the red form that verily vasus enjoy with agni as their leader\n the gods indeed neither eat nor drink only with seeing this nectar are they sait isfied\n they enter into this very form colour and out of this form they emerge\n he who knows thus this nectar becomes one of the vasus and with agni as the leader is sait isfied only with seeing this nectar\n he enters into this very form and out of this form he emerges\n as long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west so long does he retain the sovereignty and the heavenly kingdom of or similar to that of the vasus\n and that which is the second nectar i\n the white form that verily the rudras enjoy with indra as their leader\n the gods indeed neither eat nor drink only with seeing this nectar are they sait isfied\n they enter into this very form and out of this form they emerge\n he who knows thus this nectar becomes one of the rudras and with indra as the leader is sait isfied only with seeing this nectar\n he enters into this very form and out of this form he emerges\n as long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west even twice so long does he the sun rise in the south and set in the north and even so long does he retain the sovereignty and the heavenly kingdom of the rudras\n and that which is the third nectar i\n the black form that verily the adityas enjoy with varuna as their leader\n the gods indeed neither eat nor drink only with seeing this nectar are they sait isfied\n they enter into this very form and out of this form they emerge\n he who knows thus this nectar becomes one of the adityas and with varuna

nectar\n as long as the sun rises in the north and sets in the south even twice so long does he the sun rise in overhead and set below and even so long does he retain the sovereignty and the heavenly kingdom of the sadhyas\n then rising from there upward he will neither rise nor set\n he will remain alone in the middle\n there is this verse about it never does this happen there\n never did the sun set there nor did it rise\n o gods by this my assertion of the truth may i not fall from brahman \n verily for him the sun neither rises nor sets\n he who thus knows this secret of the vedas for him there is perpetual day\n hiranyagarbha imparted this doctrine of honey to prajapati prajapati to manu and manu to his progeny\n and the father told his eldest son uddalaka aruni this very knowledge of brahman\n a father may declare to his eldest son or to any other woryour disciple this very knowledge of honey\n and not to any one else even if one should offer him this sea girt earth filled with wealth\n this doctrine is certainly greater than that\n this certainly is greater than that\n gayatri indeed is all this whatever being exists\n speech indeed is gayatri for speech indeed sings and removes fear of all this that exists\n that which is this gayatri even that is this earth for on this earth are all the beings established and they do not transcend it\n that which is this earth as gayatri even that is this i\n this body in respect of this person for these senses are indeed established in this body and they do not transcend it\n that which is the body in respect of a person even that is identical with the heart within this body for these senses are indeed established in it and they do not transcend it\n this well known gayatri is four footed and sixfold\n the gayatri brahman is thus expressed in the following rik such is the greatness of this brahman called gayatri \n the person is even greater than this\n all this world is a quarter of him the other three quarters of his constitute immortality in heaven\n that which is designated as brahman even that is this akasa outside the body\n that which is the akasa outside the body even that is the akasa inside the body\n that which is the akasa inside the body even that is this akasa within the lotus of the heart\n this brahman is all filling and unchanging\n he who knows brahman thus gets all filling and unchanging prosperity\n of the said heart there are indeed five doors guarded by the gods\n he who is in that which is the eastern door of this is prana\n he is the eye he is the sun\n this brahman called prana should be meditated upon as brightness and as the source of food\n he who meditates thus becomes resplendent and an eater of food\n and he who is in that which is the southern door of this heart is vyana\n he is the ear he is the moon\n this brahman called vyana should be meditated upon as prosperity and fame\n he who meditates thus becomes prosperous and famous\n and he who is in that which is the western door of this heart is apana\n he is speech he is fire\n this brahman called apana should be meditated upon as the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom and as the source of food\n he who meditates thus becomes radiant with the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom and also an eater of food\n and he who is in that which is the northern door of this heart is samana\n he is the mind he is parjanya the rain god \n this brahman called samana should be meditated upon as fame and grace\n he who meditates thus becomes famous and graceful\n and he who is in that which is the upper door of this heart is udana\n he is the air he is the akasa\n this brahman called udana should be meditated upon as strength and nobility\n he who meditates thus becomes strong and noble\n these verily are the five persons under brahman the sentinels of the heavenly world\n he who adores thus these five persons under brahman the sentinels of the heavenly world in his family is a hero born\n he who adores thus these five persons under brahman the sentinels of the heavenly world reaches the heavenly world\n again the light of brahman that shines above this heaven above everything above all in the incomparably good and the highest worlds even this is the light within the body of man\n this light can be seen inasmuch as one has a perception of warmth when one touches the body\n it can be heard inasmuch as on closing the ears one hears something like the sound of a chariot or the bellowing of a bull or the sound of a blazing fire\n one should meditate on the light as seen and heard\n one who meditates on this thus becomes beautiful and illustrious yea one who meditates thus\n verily all this universe is brahman\n from him do all things originate into him do they dissolve and by him are they sustained\n on him should one meditate in tranquillity\n for as is one s faith such indeed one is and as is one s faith in this world such one becomes on departing hence\n let one therefore cultivate faith\n he who is permeating the mind who has prana for his body whose nature is consciousness whose resolve is infallible whose own form is like akasa whose creation is all that exists whose are all the pure desires who possesses all the agreeable odours and all the pleasant tastes who exists pervading all this who is wiyout speech and other senses who is free from agitation and eagerness this my atman residing in the lotus of the heart is smaller than a grain of paddy than a barley corn than a mustard seed than a grain of millet or than the kernel of a grain of millet\n this my atman residing in the lotus of the heart is greater than the earth greater than the sky greater than heaven greater than all these worlds\n he whose creation is all that exists whose are all the pure desires who possesses all the agreeable odours and all the pleasant tastes who exists pervading all this who is wiyout speech and other senses who is free from agitation and eagerness he is my atman residing in the lotus of the heart he is brahman\n on departing hence i shall attain to his being\n he alone who possesses this faith and has no doubt about it will obtain the result \n thus declared sandilya yea sandilya\n the chest i\n the universe having the sky as its hollow and the earth for its curved bottom does not decay\n the quarters are indeed its corners and heaven its upper lid\n this well known chest is the container of wealth\n all things rest in it\n of that chest the eastern quarter is named juhu the southern is named sahamana the western is named rajni and the northern is named subhuta\n the air is their calf\n he who knows this air the calf of the quarters thus as immortal never weeps in mourning for his son\n i wishing my son s longevity worship thus this air the calf of the quarters\n may i never weep to mourn my son\n i take refuge in the imperishable chest for such and such and such\n i take refuge in prana for such and such and such\n i take refuge in bhuh for such and such and such\n i take refuge in bhuvah for such and such and such\n i take refuge in svah for such and such and such\n when i said i take refuge in prana it was because all these beings whatsoever exist are indeed prana\n so it was in this alone that i took refuge\n then when i said i take refuge in bhuh i said only this i take refuge in the earth i take refuge in the sky i take refuge in heaven \n then when i said i take refuge in bhuvah i said only this i take refuge in fire i take refuge in air i take refuge in the sun\n then when i said i take refuge in svah i said only this i take refuge in the rig veda i take refuge in the yajur veda i take refuge in the sama veda yea that was what i said\n man truly is the sacrifice\n his first twenty four years are the morning libation for the metre gayatri is made up of twenty four syllables and the morning libation is related to the gayatri metre\n with this the vasus are connected\n the pranas indeed are the vasus for they make all this stable\n during this period of life if anything e\n illness causes him pain he should repeat o pranas vasus unite this morning libation of mind with the midday libation\n may i who am a sacrifice not be lost in the midst of the vasus who are the pranas \n he surely recovers from that and becomes healyour\n now his next forty four years are the mid day libation for the metre tristubh is made up of forty four syllables and the mid day libation is related to the tristubh metre\n with this the rudras are connected\n the pranas indeed are the rudras for they cause all this universe to weep\n during this period of life if anything e\n illness causes him pain he should repeat o pranas rudras unite this mid day libation of mine with the third libation\n may i who am a sacrifice not be lost in the midst of the rudras who are the pranas \n he surely recovers from that and becomes healyour\n then his next forty eight years are the third libation\n the metre jagati is made up of fortyeight syllables and the third libation is related to the jagati metre\n with this the adityas are connected\n the pranas indeed are the adityas for they accept all this\n during this period of life if anything e\n illness causes him pain he should repeat o pranas adityas extend this third libation of mine to a full length of life\n may i who am a sacrifice not be lost in the midst of the adityas who are the pranas\n he surely recovers from that and becomes healyour\n knowing this well known doctrine of sacrifice aitareya mahidasa said why do you afflict me thus me who cannot be so killed\n he lived for one hundred and sixteen years\n he too who knows thus lives in vigour for one hundred and sixteen years\n that he who performs the purusha sacrifice feels hunger that he feels thirst that he does not rejoice all these are the initiatory rites of this sacrifice\n and that he eats that he drinks that he rejoices all these approach upasadas\n and that he laughs that he eats that he behaves as one of a couple all these approach stotra and sastra\n and his austerity gifts uprightness non violence and truthfulness all these are the largesses of this sacrifice\n therefore people say sosyati will procreate and asosta has procreated \n again that is the procreation of this and death is the avabhrita bath\n ghora angirasa expounded this well known doctrine to devaki s son krishna and said such a knower should at the time of death repeat this triad thou art the imperishable thou art unchangeable thou art the subtle essence of prana \n on hearing the above he became thirstless\n there are these two rik stanzas in regard to this\n those knowers of brahman who have purified their mind through the withdrawal of the senses and other means like brahmacharya see everywhere the day like the supreme light of the ancient one who is the seed of the universe the light that shines in the effulgent brahman \n may we too having perceived the highest light which dispels darkness reach it\n having perceived the highest light in our own heart we have reached that highest light which is the dispeller of water rays of light and the pranas shining in all gods yea we have reached that highest light\n the mind is brahman thus one should meditate this is the meditation with regard to the body including the mind \n next the meditation with regard to the gods the akasa is brahman thus one should meditate \n both the meditations with regard to the body and with regard to the gods are being enjoined\n this same brahman has four feet\n the organ of speech is one foot\n prana the organ of smell is one foot the eye is one foot and the ear is one foot\n this is with reference to the body\n next with reference to the gods\n agni is one foot vayu is one foot aditya is one foot and the quarters are one foot\n thus both the meditations with reference to the body and with reference to the gods are enjoined\n the organ of speech is one of the four feet of brahman called mind \n with the light of fire it shines and warms\n he who knows thus shines and warms with fame and celebrity and with the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n the organ of smell is one of the four feet of brahman\n with the light of air it shines and warms\n he who knows thus shines and warms with fame and celebrity and with the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n the eye is one of the four feet of brahman\n with the light of the sun it shines and warms\n he who knows thus shines and warms with fame and celebrity and with the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n the ear is one of the four feet of brahman\n with the light of the quarters it shines and warms\n he who knows thus shines and warms with fame and celebrity and with the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom yea he who knows thus\n the sun is brahman this is the teaching\n the further explanation of this is here given \n before creation this universe was non existent\n then it became existent\n it grew it turned into an egg it lay for a period of one year and then it burst open\n of the two halves of that egg shell one was of silver and the other of gold\n of these that which was of silver is this earth\n that which was of gold is heaven\n that which was the outer membrane is the mountains\n that which was the inner membrane is the mist together with the clouds\n those which were the veins are the rivers\n that which was the water in the lower belly is the ocean\n and that which was born is the yonder sun\n after he was born sounds of the form of loud shouts arose as also all beings and all desired objects\n therefore at his rise and his every return or his setting sounds of the form of loud shouts arise as also all beings and all desired objects\n he who knows the sun thus and meditates on it as brahman auspicious sounds will hasten to him and continue to delight him yea will continue to delight\n there lived janasruti pautrayana who made gifts with respect who gave liberally and who had much food cooked for others \n he built rest houses all round thinking everywhere people will eat of my food \n once at night the swans flew along\n then one swan addressed another swan thus ho ho o bhallaksa bhallaksa the effulgence of janasruti pautrayana has spread like the heaven\n do not come in touch with it lest it should scorch you\n bhallaksa replied to him lo how could you so describe him as if he were raikva with the cart of what sort is this raikva with the cart just as all the lower casts of the dice go over to one who has won the krita cast so does go over to raikva whatsoever good the creatures do so also to him who knows what raikva knows\n such is he who has thus been spoken of by me\n janasruti pautrayana overheard those words\n as soon as he arose he said to the attendant lo did you praise me like raikva with the cart what sort of man is this raikva with the cart janasruti repeated the words of the swan just as all the lower casts of the dice go over to one who has won the krita cast so does go over to raikva whatsoever good the creatures do and so also to him who knows what raikva knows\n such is he who has thus been spoken of by me \n the attendant having searched for him came back thinking i could not find him \n janasruti said to him well where the knower of brahman should be searched for there search for him \n after searching he came to a man sitting under a cart and scratching eruptions on his skin and sitting near him asked him revered sir are you raikva with the cart well fellow yes i am he admitted\n thinking i have found him the attendant returned\n on hearing this janasruti pautrayana took with him six hundred cows a gold necklace and a chariot drawn by mules and went to raikva and addressed him thus o raikva here are for you these six hundred cows this gold necklace and this chariot drawn by mules\n now revered sir instruct me about the deity whom you worship\n the other man answered him thus ah o sudra let this gold necklace together with the chariot and the cows remain with you\n thereupon janasruti pautrayana again took with him one yousand cows a gold necklace a chariot drawn by mules and his daughter and went over to raikva\n janasruti said to him o raikva here are for you these one yousand cows this gold necklace this chariot drawn by mules this wife and this village in which you reside\n now revered sir please instruct me \n taking that princess to be the portal for the conveying of knowledge raikva said o sudra you have brought all these even by this means i\n the princess you will make me talk\n the king gave away to him all those villages in the mahavrisa country known as raikvaparna where raikva lived\n raikva said to him air indeed is the absorber\n for when a fire goes out it is in air that it merges when the sun sets it is in air that it merges when the moon sets it is in air that it merges\n when water dries up it is in air that it merges for air absorbs all these\n this is the doctrine of samvarga with reference to the gods\n next is the doctrine of samvarga with reference to the body prana indeed is the absorber\n when one sleeps speech merges in prana the eye merges in prana the ear merges in prana the mind merges in prana for prana indeed absorbs all these\n these indeed are the two absorbers air among the gods and prana among the sense organs\n once upon a time while kapeya saunaka and kaksaseni abhipratarin were being served with food a celibate student of sacred knowledge begged of them\n they did not give him anything\n the brahmacharin said prajapati the one god swallowed up the four great ones he is the protector of the worlds\n o kapeya o abhipratarin mortals do not see him who dwells variously\n even from him for whom all this food is meant you have withheld it\n kapeya saunaka reflecting on those words approached him and said he who is the self of all gods and the creator of all beings who has undecaying teeth who is the devourer who is the wise one who is himself never eaten but who devours even those who are not food and hence the knowers describe his magnificence as immeasurable such indeed is the brahman o brahmacharin whom we worship \n then he told the servants give him food \n they gave him food\n now these five and the other five together becoming ten constitute the krita dice cast \n because the number ten applies to both these ten are the food or virat dwelling in all the ten quarters and these are the enjoyer krita\n this virat of the form of ten deities again is the eater of food as krita by him all this is perceived\n he who sees thus by him also all this is perceived and he becomes as eater of food\n once upon a time satyakama jabala addressed his mother jabala mother i desire to live the life of a celibate student of sacred knowledge in the teacher s house\n of what lineage am i she said to him my child i do not know of what lineage you are\n i who was engaged in many works and in attending on others got you in my youth\n having been such i could not know of what lineage you are\n however i am jabala by name and you are named satyakama\n so you speak of yourself only as satyakama jabala\n he went to haridrumata gautama and said i desire to live under you revered sir as a brahmacharin may i approach your venerable self for the same gautama asked him dear boy of what lineage are you he replied sir i do not know of what lineage i am\n i asked my mother she replied i who was engaged in many works and in attending on others got you in my youth\n having been such i could not know of what lineage you are\n however i am jabala by name and you are named satyakama \n so sir i am satyakama jabala\n the teacher said to him no one who is not a brahmana can speak thus\n dear boy bring the sacrificial fuel i shall initiate you as a brahmacharin for you have not deviated from truth \n having initiated him he sorted out four hundred lean and weak cows and said dear boy follow them\n while he was driving them towards the forest satyakama said i shall not return till it is one yousand\n he lived away for a long time till they had increased to one yousand\n then the bull addressed him thus satyakama yes revered sir thus he responded dear boy we have reached a yousand take us to the house of the teacher\n let me instruct you about one foot of brahman also \n please instruct me revered sir\n the bull said to him the eastern quarter is one part the western quarter is one part the southern quarter is one part the northern quarter is one part\n this indeed dear boy is one foot of brahman consisting of four named the radiant\n he who knows this one foot of brahman consisting of four parts thus and meditates on it as the radiant becomes radiant in this world\n he who knows this one foot of brahman consisting of four parts thus and meditates on it as the radiant wins the radiant regions in the next world \n fire will tell you of one foot of brahman \n at dawn of the next day he drove the cows towards the teacher s house\n towards evening at the place where those cows came together he kindled the fire there penned the cows laid on fuel and sat down near them behind the fire facing the east\n the fire addressed him satyakama yes revered sir he responded\n dear boy let me instruct you about one foot of brahman \n please instruct me revered sir\n the fire said to him the earth is one part the sky is one part heaven is one part and the ocean is one part\n this indeed dear boy is one foot of brahman consisting of four parts named the endless\n he who knows this one foot of brahman consisting of four parts thus and meditates on it as the endless becomes endless in this world\n he who knows this one foot of brahman consisting of four parts thus and meditates on it as the endless wins the endless undecaying regions\n the swan will tell you of one foot of brahman \n at dawn of the next day he drove the cows towards the teacher s house\n towards evening at the place where the cows came together he kindled the fire there penned the cows laid on fuel and sat down near them behind the fire facing the east\n the swan flew to him and addressed him satyakama yes revered sir he responded\n dear boy let me instruct you about one foot of brahman \n please instruct me revered sir\n the swan said to him fire is one part the sun is one part the moon is one part and lightning is one part\n this indeed dear boy is one foot of brahman consisting of four parts named the effulgent\n he who knows this one foot of brahman consisting of four parts thus and meditates on it as the effulgent becomes effulgent in this world\n he who knows this one foot of brahman consisting of four parts thus and meditates on it as the effulgent wins the effulgent regions of the sun the moon etc\n in the next world \n madgu will tell you of one foot of brahman \n at dawn of the next day he drove the cows towards the teacher s house\n towards evening at the place where the cows came together he kindled the fire there penned the cows laid on fuel and sat down near them behind the fire facing the east\n the madgu bird flew to him and addressed him satyakama yes revered sir he responded\n dear boy let me instruct you about one foot of brahman \n please instruct me revered sir \n the madgu bird said to him prana is one part the eye is one part the ear is one part and the mind is one part\n this indeed dear boy is one foot of brahman consisting of four parts named the repository\n he who knows this one foot of brahman consisting of four parts thus and meditates on it as the repository becomes repository i\n with proper abode in this world\n he who knows this one foot of brahman consisting of four parts thus and meditates on it as the repository wins the repository i\n extensive regions in the next world \n satyakama reached the house of the teacher\n the teacher addressed him satyakama yes revered sir he responded\n dear boy you shine like a knower of brahman who is it that has instructed you satyakama assured him people other than men\n but i wish revered sir that you would expound it to me\n i have definitely heard from persons like your venerable self that the knowledge directly learnt from one s own teacher becomes most beneficial \n the teacher taught him the same thing and nothing was omitted from this yea nothing was omitted\n once upon a time upakosala kamalayana lived with satyakama jabala the life of a brahmacharin\n he tended his fires for twelve years\n satyakama performed for other disciples the ceremony of completing studies and returning home but did not perform the ceremony for upakosala\n the wife of the teacher said to him this brahmacharin has undergone severe austerities and has tended the fires properly you should teach him so that the fires may not blame you\n but the teacher went away on a journey wiyout instructing him\n through mental sufferings upakosala began to fast\n the wife of the teacher said to him o brahmacharin do eat why are you not eating he replied in this very ordinary and disappointed man i\n myself there are many desires running in various directions i am full of mental sufferings so i shall not eat\n thereupon the fires said among themselves this brahmacharin has undergone severe austerities and has tended us properly come let us instruct him \n they then said to him prana life is brahman ka joy is brahman kha ether is brahman \n he said i understand that prana is brahman but i do not understand ka and kha\n they said what is ka even that is kha and what is kha even that is ka \n then the fires instructed him about prana brahman and the akasa within the heart related to it\n then the garhapatya fire instructed him earth fire food and the sun are my forms \n the person who is seen in the sun i am he i am he indeed\n he who knows it thus and meditates on it destroys sinful acts wins the region of fire reaches the full length of life lives gloriously and his descendants never perish\n we protect him in this world and in the next who knows it thus and meditates on it\n then the anvaharyapacana fire instructed him water the quarters the stars and the moon are my forms \n the person who is seen in the moon i am he i am he indeed\n he who knows it thus and meditates on it destroys sinful acts wins the region of fire reaches the full length of life lives gloriously and his descendants never perish\n we protect him in this world and in the next who knows it thus and meditates on it\n then the ahavaniya fire instructed him prana akasa heaven and lightning are my forms \n the person who is seen in the lightning i am he i am he indeed\n he who knows it thus and meditates on it destroys sinful acts wins the region of fire reaches the full length of life lives gloriously and his descendants never perish\n we protect him in this world and in the next who knows it thus and meditates on it\n the fires said o upakosala dear boy to you are revealed this knowledge of the fires and the knowledge of the atman but the teacher will tell you the way\n his teacher came back\n the teacher addressed him upakosala yes revered sir he responded\n dear boy your face shines like that of a knower of brahman who is it that has instructed you who should instruct me sir said he\n here he concealed the truth as it were\n for this reason it is that yough they were formerly otherwise they are now this wise \n so saying he hinted at the part played by the fires in this matter\n what did they tell you dear boy this thus he acknowledged\n dear boy they have told you about the regions only but i shall tell you the object of your desire i\n just as water does not cling to the lotus leaf so also sin does not cling to him who knows brahman thus \n revered sir please instruct me further \n the teacher said to him this person who is seen in the eye he is the atman said the teacher this is the immortal the fearless\n hence even if one sprinkles clarified butter or water into the eye it goes away to the edges\n the knowers of brahman call him as the centre of blessings for all blessings come together in him\n all blessings come together in him who knows thus\n he again is the vehicle of blessings for he carries all blessings\n he who knows it thus carries all blessings\n he who knows it thus carries all blessings\n he again is the vehicle of light for he shines in all the regions\n he who knows it thus shines in all the regions\n now as for such persons whether the cremation rites are performed or not they go to light from light to the day from the day to the bright fortnight from the bright fortnight to those six months during which the sun rises towards the north from the months to the year from the year to the sun from the sun to the moon from the moon to the lightning\n from the region of brahman a person who is other than human comes and causes them existing there to realize brahman\n this is the path of the gods and the path to brahman\n those who go by this path do not return to this human whirlpool yes they do not return\n he who blows i\n air is indeed the sacrifice he moving along purifies all this\n and because moving along he purifies all this he is the sacrifice\n mind and speech are the two paths of this sacrifice\n one of these two paths the brahman priest embellishes with the mind\n the hotir adhvaryu and udgatir priests embellish the other with speech\n after the prataranuvaka the morning recitation is commenced and before the paridhaniya rik is begun if the brahman priest speaks out breaking silence then he embellishes only one path viz\n speech and the other is injured\n just as a man walking with one leg or a chariot moving with one wheel suffers injury so also that sacrifice of this one suffers injury and when the sacrifice suffers injury the sacrificer also suffers injury\n for having completed the defective sacrifice he becomes a worse sinner\n but after the prataranuvaka is commenced and before the paridhaniya rik is begun if the brahman priest does not break his silence then both the paths are embellished and neither one is injured\n and just as a man walking with both the legs or a chariot moving with both the wheels remains intact so also the sacrifice of this one remains intact\n if the sacrifice remains intact the sacrificer also remains intact\n he becomes great by performing the sacrifice\n prajapati brooded on the worlds\n from them thus brooded upon he extracted their essences fire from the earth air from the sky and the sun from heaven\n he brooded on these three deities\n from them thus brooded upon he extracted their essences the riks from fire the yajus mantras from air and the saman from the sun\n he brooded on the three vedas\n from them thus brooded upon he extracted their existences bhuh from the riks bhuvah from the yajus mantras and svah from the samans\n therefore if the sacrifice is rendered defective on account of the riks then with the mantra bhuh svaha the brahman priest should offer an oblation in the garhapatya fire\n thus verily through the essence of the riks through the virility of the riks he makes good the injury of the sacrifice in respect of the riks\n and if the sacrifice is rendered defective on account of the yajus then with the mantra bhuvah svaha the brahman priest should offer an oblation in the daksinagni\n thus verily through the essence of the yajus mantras through the virility of the yajus mantras he makes good the injury of the sacrifice in respect of the yajus mantras\n and if the sacrifice is rendered defective on account of the samans then with the mantra svah svaha the brahman priest should offer an oblation to the ahavaniya fire\n thus verily through the essence of the samans through the virility of the saman he makes good the injury of the sacrifice in respect of the samans\n just as one would join gold with salt silver with gold tin with silver lead with tin iron with lead wood with iron and wood with leather even so does the brahman priest make good the injury of the sacrifice through the virility of these regions of these deities and of the three vedas\n that sacrifice indeed is healed where there is a brahman priest knowing thus\n that sacrifice indeed becomes inclined to the north where there is a brahman priest knowing thus\n it is in reference to the brahman priest knowing thus that there is this song whence soever the sacrifice comes back thither verily does the brahman priest go to remedy \n just as the mare protects the soldier even so the silent brahman priest is the only priest who protects the people engaged in rituals\n the brahman priest who knows thus verily protects the sacrifice the sacrificer and all the priests\n hence one should appoint as a brahman priest only him who knows thus not one who does not know thus yea not one who does not know thus\n om verily he who knows the eldest and the best surely becomes the eldest and the best\n prana is indeed the eldest and the best of the organs \n verily he who knows the richest becomes the richest among his own people\n speech is indeed the richest\n verily he who knows the stable basis becomes stabilized in this world and in the next\n the eye is indeed the stable basis\n verily he who knows prosperity attains all desires both divine and human\n the ear is indeed prosperity\n verily he who knows the abode becomes the abode of his people\n the mind is indeed the abode\n now once the five senses disputed among themselves about their personal superiority saying i am superior \n those senses approached the father prajapati and said to him revered sir who is the best amongst us he replied he amongst you is the best on whose departure the body would appear its worst as it were\n staying a year out it came back and asked how have you been able to live wiyout me the others replied just like the dumb yough not speaking yet living with the breath seeing with the eyes hearing with the ear and thinking with the mind\n at this speech entered the body \n staying a year out it came back and asked how have you been able to live wiyout me the others replied just like the blind yough not seeing yet living with the breath speaking with the organ of speech hearing with the ear and thinking with the mind\n at this the eye entered the body \n staying a year out it came back and asked how have you been able to live wiyout me the others replied just like the deaf yough not hearing yet living with the breath speaking with the organ of speech seeing with the eye and thinking with the mind\n at this the ear entered the body \n staying a year out it came back and asked how have you been able to live wiyout me the others replied just like infants wiyout developed minds yet living with the breath speaking with the organ of speech seeing with the eye and hearing with the ear\n at this the mind entered the body \n then as the prana was about to depart it uprooted the other senses just as a horse of mettle would uproot the pegs to which it is tethered\n they all then came to it and said o revered sir be our lord you are the best amongst us do not depart from the body\n then speech said to that one just as i am the richest in the same manner are you also the richest \n then the eye said to that one just as i am the stable basis in the same manner are you also the stable basis \n then the ear said to that one just as i am prosperity in the same manner are you also prosperity\n then the mind said to that one just as i am the abode in the same manner are you also the abode\n verily people do not call them as organs of speech nor as eyes nor as ears nor as minds\n but they call them only as pranas for the prana indeed is all these\n he the prana asked what will be my food whatever there is here even the food of dogs and birds replied the senses\n whatever is eaten all that is the food of ana\n the name ana indeed is self evident\n for him who knows thus there is nothing that is not food\n he asked what will be my garments water replied the senses\n therefore indeed those who are about to eat cover it both before and after with water\n he who knows thus becomes the obtainer of clothes and of upper garments\n satyakama jabala imparted this doctrine of prana to gosruti the son of vyaghrapada and said if anyone should impart this even to a dry stump then branches would certainly shoot and leaves would sprout from it \n next if that knower of prana desires to attain greatness then having consecrated himself on the new moon day he should on the full moon night stir up in a vessel of curd and honey the mash of all herbs and then offer an oblation into the fire on the spot prescribed for offerings with the mantra svaha to the eldest and the best and throw what remains attached to the ladle into the mash pot\n with the mantra svaha to the richest he should offer an oblation into the fire on the spot prescribed for offerings and throw what remains attached to the ladle into the mash pot\n with the mantra svaha to what is stable he should offer an oblation into the fire on the spot prescribed for offerings and throw what remains attached to the ladle into the mash pot\n with mantra svaha to prosperity he should offer an oblation into the fire on the spot prescribed for offerings and throw what remains attached to the ladle into the mash pot\n with the mantra svaha to the abode he should offer an oblation into the fire on the spot prescribed for offerings and throw what remains attached to the ladle into the mash pot\n then moving a little away and taking the mash pot in his hands he should recite the mantra you are ama by name for all this universe rests with you\n you as prana is the eldest the best the effulgent and sovereign\n may he i\n you as prana lead me to the eldest age to the best position to effulgence and to sovereignty\n verily i wish to become all this\n then reciting this rik mantra foot by foot he should sip\n we pray for that food pertaining to the progenitor saying this line he should sip\n we pray for the food of the effulgent one saying this he should sip\n which is the best and all sustaining saying this he should sip\n we readily meditate upon the form of the deity bhaga saying this and washing the pot shaped like a kamsa goblet or a camasa cup he should drink all\n then he should lie down behind the fire on a skin or on the ground controlling speech and mind\n if he should see a woman in a dream he should know that his rite has succeeded\n there is this verse about it during the performance of the rites for desired results if the performer sees a woman in a dream then he should recognize fulfilment in this vision in a dream yea in this vision in a dream\n once svetaketu the grandson of aruna came to the assembly of the panchalas\n pravahana the son of jivala enquired of him my boy has your father instructed you he has indeed revered sir \n do you know where created beings go above from here no revered sir \n do you know the place of parting of the two paths the path of the gods and the path of the fathers no revered sir \n do you know why the other world is not filled up no revered sir \n do you know how at the fifth oblation the liquid oblations or unseen results of action come to be designated as man no indeed revered sir \n then why did you say i have been instructed foz how can he who does not know these things say i have been instructed he was distressed and came to his father s place and said to him revered sir wiuhout having instructed me properly you said i have instructed you \n that nominal kshatriya asked me five questions and i was not able to answer even one of them \n the father said even as you have spoken to me about them so do i not know even one of them\n if i had known them why should i not have toll you then gautama went to the king s place\n when he arrived the king made reverential offerings to him\n in the morning he presented himself to the king when he was in the assembly\n the king said to him o revered gautama please ask for a boon of human wealth \n he replied o king let the human wealth remain with you tell me those words which you spoke to my boy \n the king was perturbed\n the king commanded him stay here for a long time\n at the end of the period he said to him even as you told me o gautama prior to you this knowledge never went to the brahmanas\n this is why the expounding of this knowledge belonged to the kshatriyas in earlier times in all the worlds \n then he instructed him\n the world yonder is indeed the fire o gautama\n of that the sun is the fuel the rays are the smoke the day is the flame the moon is the embers and the stars are the sparks\n into this fire the deities offer the oblation of faith\n out of that oblation king soma arises\n parjanya is indeed the fire o gautama\n of that the air is the fuel the cloud is the smoke the lightning is the flame the thunderbolt is the embers and the rumblings of thunder are the sparks\n into this fire the deities offer the oblation of king soma\n out of that oblation rain arises\n the earth indeed is the fire o gautama\n of that the year is the fuel akasa is the smgke night is the flame the directions are the embers and the intermediate directions are the sparks\n into this fire the deities offer the oblation of rain\n out of that oblation food in the shape of corn arises\n man indeed is the fire o gautama\n of that speech is the fuel prana is the smoke the tongue is the flame the eye is the embers and the ear is the sparks\n into this fire the deities offer the oblation of food\n out of that oblation the seed arises\n woman indeed is the fire o gautama\n into this fire the deities offer the oblation of the seed\n out of that oblation the foetus arises\n thus at the fifth oblation the oblation called water comes to be designated as man\n that foetus covered with membrane lies for nine or ten months and is then born\n being born he lives whatever the length of his life may be\n when he is dead to attain the world as ordained they carry him from here for cremation to fire itself from which alone he came and from which he arose\n among them those who know thus this knowledge of the five fires and those who are devoted to faith and austerity in the forest they go to light from light to the day from the day to the bright fortnight from the bright fortnight to those six months during which the sun travels northward from the months to the year from the year to the sun from the sun to the moon and from the moon to the lightning\n from the region of brahman a person who is other than human comes and causes them existing there to attain brahman\n this is the path of the gods\n but those who living in villages as householders pracit ise sacrifices and works of public utility and gift go to smoke from smoke to night from night to the dark fortnight from the dark fortnight to those months during which the sun travels southward\n from there they do not reach the year like those going the path of the gods \n from the months they go to the region of the fathers from the region of the fathers to akasa from akasa to the moon\n this moon is king soma the king of the brahmanas \n this is the food of the deities\n this the deities eat\n residing in that region of the moon till they have exhausted the results of action they then return again the same way as they came by the path that is being mentioned \n they come to akasa and from akasa to air\n having become air they become smoke\n having become smoke they become the white cloud\n having become the white cloud they become the rain bearing cloud\n having become the cloud they fall as rain\n then they are born in this world as rice and barley herbs and trees sesamum plants and beans\n but the release from these is more difficult for whoever eats the food and sows the seed they become like him only\n among them those who have good residual results of action here earned in this world and left as residue after the enjoyment in the region of the moon quickly reach a good womb the womb of a brahmana or of a kshatriya or of a vaisya\n but those who have bad residual results of action quickly reach an evil womb the womb of a dog or of a hog or of a chandala\n then by neither of these two paths do they go\n they as small creatures keep repeatedly revolving subject to the saying be born and die \n this is the third state\n therefore that region of the moon is never filled up\n hence one should be disgusted with this state \n there is this verse about it\n one who steals gold one who drinks wine one who dishonours the teacher s bed and one who injures a brahmana all these four fall as also the fifth one who associates with them\n moreover he who knows worships these five fires thus even yough he associates with those sinners is not tainted by sin\n he who knows these thus becomes cleansed and pure and obtains the meritorious world yea he who knows thus\n pracinasala the son of upamanyu satyayajna the son of pulusa indradyumna the son of bhallavi jana the son of sarkaraksa and budila the son of asvatarasva these five great householders and great vedic scholars having come together held a discussion on what is our atman what is brahman they reflected among themselves revered sirs uddalaka the son of aruna knows well this vaisvanara atman\n well let us go to him \n and they went to him\n uddalaka reflected these great householders and great vedic scholars are going to uestion me but possibly i shall not be able to tell them everything\n however i shall direct them to another teacher \n uddalaka said to the revered sirs at present asvapati the son of kekaya is studying this vaisvanara atman\n well let us go to him \n then they went to him\n when they arrived the king arranged for each of them separately a welcome with suitable rites\n next morning on rising he said to them in my kingdom there is no thief no miser no drunkard no man who has not installed the fire no ignorant person no adulterer so how can there be any adulteress revered sirs i am going to perform a sacrifice\n in that as much wealth sirs as i give to each single priest shall i give to you also\n revered sirs please remain \n they said the purpose for which a man goes to another on that alone he should speak to him\n you are at present studying the vaisvanara atman please tell us of that\n the king said to them i shall answer you in the morning \n in the morning they approached him with sacrificial fuel in their hands\n the king wiyout receiving them as initiated pupils spoke thus o aupamanyava what is the atman on which you meditate he replied heaven only o venerable king \n the king said this that you meditate upon as atman is the vaisvanara atman known as the highly luminous \n therefore in your family are seen the suta prasuta and asuta libations of soma juice\n so you eat food and see what is dear\n one who meditates on this vaisvanara atman thus eats food and sees what is dear and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n but this is only the head of the atman\n if you had not come to me your head a portion would have fallen down\n then the king said to satyayajna paulusi o pracinayogya what is that atman on which you meditate he replied the sun only o venerable king \n the king said this that you meditate upon as atman is the vaisvanara atman known as the multiform \n therefore in your family are seen all kinds of enjoyable things\n so for you are provided a chariot drawn by mules maid servants and a gold necklace so you eat food and see what is dear\n one who thus meditates upon this vaisvanara atman eats food and sees what is dear and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n but this is only the eye of the atman\n if you had not come to me you would have become blind\n then the king said to indradyumna bhallaveya o descendant of vyaghrapada what is that atman on which you meditate he replied air only o venerable king\n the king said this that you meditate upon as atman is the vaisvanara atman known as the diversely coursed \n therefore from diverse directions offerings come to you and various rows of chariots follow you\n so you eat food and see what is dear\n one who thus meditates upon this vaisvanara atman eats food and sees what is dear and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n but this is only the prana of the atman\n if you had not come to me your prana would have departed \n then the king said to jana o sarkaraksya what is that atman on which you meditate he replied akasa only o venerable king \n the king said this that you meditate upon as atman is the vaisvanara atman known as the manifold \n therefore are your offspring and wealth manifold\n so you eat food and see what is dear\n one who thus meditates upon this vaisvanara atman eats food and sees what is dear and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n but this is only the trunk of the atman\n if you had not come to me your trunk would have been shattered \n then the king said to budila asvatarasvi o vaiyaghrapadya what is that atman on which you meditate he replied water only o venerable king \n the king said this that you meditate upon as atman is the vaisvanara atman known as the wealth \n therefore are you endowed with wealth and bodily strength\n so you eat food and see what is dear\n one who thus meditates upon this vaisvanara atman eats food and sees what is dear and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n but this is only the lower belly of the atman\n if you had not come to me your lower belly would have burst \n then the king said to uddalaka aruni o gautama what is that atman on which you meditate he replied the earth only o venerable king \n the king said this that you meditate upon as atman is the vaisvanara atman known as the foundation \n therefore are you well founded in offspring and cattle \n so you eat food and see what is dear\n one who thus meditates upon this vaisvanara atman eats food and sees what is dear and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n but this is only the feet of the atman\n if you had not come to me your feet would have withered away \n the king said to them all of you with partial knowledge eat food knowing the vaisvanara atman differently as it were\n but one who thus meditates upon this vaisvanara atman as a whole consisting of parts and self conscious eats food in all the worlds in all the beings and in all the selves\n of the aforesaid vaisvanara atman the head is the highly luminous the eye is the multiform the breath is the diversely coursed the trunk is the vast the lower belly is the wealth the feet are the earth the foundation \n of the enjoyer as vaisvanara the chest is the altar the hairs on the chest are the kusa grass the heart is the garhapatya fire the mind is the anvaharyapacana fire and the mouth is the ahavaniya fire\n therefore the food that comes first should be an object of oblation\n that eater when he offers the first oblation should offer it with the mantra svaha to prana thereby prana is sait isfied\n prana being sait isfied the eye is sait isfied the eye being sait isfied the sun is sait isfied the sun being sait isfied heaven is sait isfied heaven being sait isfied whatever is under heaven and the sun is sait isfied\n through its sait isfaction the eater himself is sait isfied\n he is sait isfied also with offspring cattle food lustre and the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n then when he offers the second oblation he should offer it with the mantra svaha to vyana thereby vyana is sait isfied\n vyana being sait isfied the ear is sait isfied the ear being sait isfied the moon is sait isfied the moon being sait isfied the quarters are sait isfied the quarters being sait isfied whatever is under the moon and the quarters is sait isfied\n through its sait isfaction the eater himself is sait isfied\n he is sait isfied also with offspring cattle food lustre and the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n then when he offers the third oblation he should offer it with the mantra svaha to apana thereby apana is sait isfied\n apana being sait isfied speech is sait isfied speech being sait isfied fire is sait isfied fire being sait isfied the earth is sait isfied the earth being sait isfied whatever is under the earth and fire is sait isfied\n through its sait isfaction the eater himself is sait isfied\n he is sait isfied also with offspring cattle food lustre and the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n then when he offers the fourth oblation he should offer it with the mantra svaha to samana thereby samana is sait isfied\n samana being sait isfied the mind is sait isfied the mind being sait isfied parjanya rain god is sait isfied parjanya being sait isfied lightning is sait isfied lightning being sait isfied whatever is under lightning and parjanya is sait isfied\n through its sait isfaction the eater himself is sait isfied\n he is sait isfied also with offspring cattle food lustre and the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n then when he offers the fifth oblation he should offer it with the mantra svaha to udana thereby udana is sait isfied\n udana being sait isfied the skin is sait isfied the skin being sait isfied the air is sait isfied the air being sait isfied akasa is sait isfied akasa being sait isfied whatever is under the air and akasa is sait isfied\n through its sait isfaction the eater himself is sait isfied\n he is sait isfied also with offspring cattle food lustre and the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom\n if anyone wiyout knowing this offers the agnihotra it would be just a man removing the live embers and pouring the oblation on the ashes\n but if one knowing it thus offers the agnihotra to prana his oblation is poured into all the worlds all the beings and all the selves\n so even as reed cotton when laid on the fire is burnt up so are burnt up all the sins of this one who knowing it thus offers the agnihotra\n therefore even if one who knows thus offers the remnant of his food to a chandala then also that food becomes his offering to the vaisvanara atman only\n there is this verse about it\n as in this world hungry boys gather round their mother even so all the creatures wait upon the agnihotra\n once upon a time there was one svetaketu the grandson of aruna\n his father said to him o svetaketu live the life of a brahmacharin\n dear boy there never is anyone in our family who does not study and is only nominally a brahmana\n having gone to the teacher s house when twelve years old he came back when he was twenty four old having studied all the vedas conceited arrogant and regarding himself as very learned\n his father said to him svetaketu dear boy you i see are conceited arrogant regarding yourself as very learned did you ask for that teaching about the supreme brahman through which what is unheard becomes heard what is unyought becomes yought of what is unknown becomes known of what nature revered sir is that teaching dear boy just as through a single clod of clay all that is made of clay would become known for all modifications is but name based upon words and the clay alone is real dear boy just as through a single ingot of gold all that is made of gold would become known for all modification is but name based upon words and the gold alone is real dear boy just as through a single nail parer all that is made of iron would become known for all modification is but name based upon words and the iron alone is real such dear boy is that teaching\n surely my revered teachers did not know it for if they had known why should they not have told it to me however revered father teach it to me \n be it so dear boy said the father \n in the beginning dear boy this was being alone one only wiyout a second\n some say that in the beginning this was non being alone one only wiyout a second\n from that non being arose being\n aruni said but now indeed dear boy could it be so how could being arise from non being in truth dear boy in the beginning before creation there was being alone one only wiyout a second\n that being willed may i become many may i grow forth\n that fire willed may i become many may i grow forth \n therefore whenever a man grieves or perspires then it is from fire that water issues\n that water willed may i become many may i grow forth\n therefore wherever it rains abundant food grows there it is from water that food for eating is produced\n of the aforesaid beings there are only three origins those born from eggs born from living beings and born from sprouts\n that deity willed well let me entering into these three deities through this living self jivatman differentiate name and form\n of these let me make each one triplicated willing thus this deity entered into these three deities through this living self and differentiated names and forms\n it made each one of them threefold\n but dear boy how each of these three deities becomes threefold outside the body know that from me\n in fire the red colour is the colour of fire that which is white belongs to water and that which is black belongs to food earth \n thus vanishes the idea of the quality of fire from fire for all modification is but name based upon words only the three forms are real\n in the sun the red colour is the colour of fire that which is white belongs to water and that which is black belongs to earth\n thus vanishes the idea of the quality of the sun from the sun for all modification is but name based upon words only the three forms are real\n in the moon the red colour is the colour of fire that which is white belongs to water and that which is black belongs to earth\n thus vanishes the idea of the quality of the moon from the moon for all modification is but name based upon words only the three forms are real\n in lightning the red colour is the colour of fire that which is white belongs to water and that which is black belongs to earth\n thus vanishes the idea of the quality of lightning from lightning for all modification is but name based upon words only the three forms are real\n it was indeed on knowing this triplication that the ancient great householders and great vedic scholars said there is at present nothing that anyone would point out to us as unheard unyought or unknown for from these they understood everything\n whatever else appeared red that also they knew to be the colour of untriplicated fire whatever appeared white that also they knew to be the colour of water whatever appeared black that also they knew to be the colour of earth\n whatever appeared to be unknown that also they knew to be a combination of these very deities\n but dear boy know from me how on reaching man each of these three deities becomes threefold\n food when eaten becomes divided into three parts\n what is its grossest ingredient that becomes faeces what is the middling ingredient that becomes flesh and what is the subtlest ingredient that becomes mind\n water when drunk becomes divided into three parts\n what is its grossest ingredient that becomes urine what is the middling ingredient that becomes blood and what is the subtlest ingredient that becomes prana\n fire when eaten becomes divided into three parts\n what is its grossest ingredient that becomes bone what is the middling ingredient that becomes marrow and what is the subtlest ingredient hat becomes speech\n hence dear boy mind is made up of food prana is made up of water and speech is made of fire\n explain it further to me revered sir \n be it so dear boy said the father\n dear boy of the curd that is being churned that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and that becomes butter\n so also dear boy of the food that is eaten that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and that becomes the mind\n dear boy of the water that is drunk that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and that becomes prana\n dear boy of the fire that is eaten that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and that becomes speech\n hence dear boy mind is made up of food prana is made up of water and speech is made up of fire \n explain it further to me revered sir \n be it so dear boy said the father\n dear boy man consists of sixteen parts\n do not eat for fifteen days drink as much water as you like\n prana is made up of water and the prana of one who drinks water is not cut off\n svetaketu did not eat for fifteen days\n then he approached him saying what shall i say the father said the riks the yajus and the samans dear boy\n they do not at all arise in me sir \n the father said to him dear boy just as a single ember of the size of a firefly left over from a large burning fire cannot burn any more than that even so dear boy of your sixteen parts only one part is left over now by means of that you cannot perceive the vedas\n eat then you will understand me \n he ate and then approached his father\n whatever he asked him he answered them all\n the father said to him dear boy just as when a single ember of the size of a firefly left over from a large burning fire is made to blaze up by adding straw and it burns much more than before even so dear boy of your sixteen parts only one part remained and that being nourished by food has been made to blaze up and by that you perceive the vedas now\n hence dear boy the mind is made up of food the prana is made up of water and speech is made up of fire\n from his words svetaketu understood it yea he understood it\n once uddalaka aruni said to his son svetaketu dear boy know from me the true nature of sleep\n when a man is said to be sleeping then dear boy he has become united with being and has attained his own nature\n hence people speak of him as sleeping for them he has attained his own nature\n just as a bird tied to a string after flying in various directions and finding no resting place elsewhere takes refuge at the very place where to it is tied even so dear boy that mind after flying in various directions and finding no resting place elsewhere takes refuge in prana alone for the mind dear boy is tied to prana\n dear boy know from me the true nature of hunger and thirst\n when a man is said to be hungry then it is to be understood that water is leading away what has been eaten therefore water may be designated as hunger \n just as people speak of the leader of cows the leader of horses and the leader of men even so they speak of water as the leader of food\n hence dear boy know this shoot the body to be put forth by a root for it cannot be wiyout a root\n where could its root be apart from food even so dear boy with food as the shoot look for water as the root with water as the shoot dear boy look for fire as the root with fire as the shoot dear boy look for being as the root\n all these creatures dear boy have being as their root have being as their abode and have being as their support\n again when a man is said to be thirsty then it is to be understood that fire is leading away what has been drunk therefore fire may be designated as thirst \n just as people speak of the leader of cows the leader of horses and the leader of men even so they speak of that fire as the leader of water\n hence dear boy know this shoot water to be put forth by a root for it cannot be wiyout a root\n where could its root be apart from water dear boy with water as the shoot look for fire as the root with fire as the shoot look for being as the root\n all these creatures dear boy have being as their root have being as their abode and have being as their support\n how dear boy each of these three deities on reaching man becomes threefold has been explained to you earlier\n when this man is about to depart dear boy his speech merges in the mind mind in prana prana in fire and fire in the supreme deity\n that being which is this subtle essence cause even that all this world has for its self\n that is the true\n that is the atman\n that you art o svetaketu\n revered sir please explain it further to me \n so be it dear boy said the father \n as dear boy the bees make honey by collecting juices from different trees and reduce them into one essence and there as these juices have no such discrimination as i am the juice of this tree i am the juice of that tree even so dear boy all these creatures having merged into being do not know we have merged into being\n whatever these creatures are here tiger or lion or wolf or boar or worm or flying insect or gad fly or mosquito that they become again\n that being which is this subtle essence cause even that all this world has for its self\n that is the true\n that is the atman\n that you art o svetaketu\n revered sir please explain it further to me \n so be it dear boy said the father \n these eastern rivers dear boy flow along to the east and the western ones to the west\n they rise from the ocean and merge in the ocean and become that ocean itself\n and there as these rivers do not know themselves as i am this river i am that river even so dear boy all these creatures having come from being do not know we have come from being \n and whatever these creatures were here tiger or lion or wolf or boar or worm or flying insect or gad fly or mosquito that they become again\n that being which is this subtle essence cause even that all this world has for its self\n that is the true\n that is the atman\n that you art o svetaketu\n revered sir please explain it further to me \n so be it dear boy said the father \n of this large tree dear boy if anyone were to strike at the root it would exude sap yough still living if anyone were to strike in the middle it would exude sap yough still living if anyone were to strike at the top it would exude sap yough still living\n as that tree is pervaded by the living self it stands firm drinking constantly and rejoicing\n if the life leaves one branch of this tree then that branch dries up if it leaves the second one then that dries up it leaves the whole tree the whole tree dries up\n the father said dear boy know that even so being left by the living self this body surely dies but the living self does not die\n that being which is this subtle essence cause even that all this world has for its self\n that is the true\n that is the atman\n that you art o svetaketu\n revered sir please explain it further to me \n so be it dear boy said the father \n bring a fruit from this banyan tree \n here it is revered sir \n it is broken revered sir \n what do you see in this these seeds small like particles revered sir \n break one of these my child \n it is broken revered sir \n what do you see in it nothing revered sir \n the father said to him dear boy this subtle essence which you do not perceive growing from this subtle essence the large banyan tree thus stands\n have faith dear boy\n that being which is this subtle essence cause even that all this world has for its self\n that is the true\n that is the atman\n that you art o svetaketu\n revered sir please explain it further to me \n so be it dear boy said the father \n put this salt into water and then come to me in the morning \n the father said to him bring the salt my child which you put into water at night \n having searched for it he did not find it as it has completely dissolved\n my child take a sip from the top of this water\n how is it it is salt \n take a sip from the middle\n how is it it is salt \n take a sip from the bottom\n how is it it is salt \n throw this water away and then come to me \n he did so and returned saying it is there always \n the father said to him dear boy as you do not see what is present in this water yough indeed it exists in it similarly being exists indeed in this body\n that being which is this subtle essence cause even that all this world has for its self\n that is the true\n that is the atman\n that you art o svetaketu\n revered sir please explain it further to me \n so be it dear boy said the father \n just as dear boy some robber having brought a man from the gandhara region with his eyes bound up might leave him in a very desolate place and just as that man would shout towards the east or towards the north or towards the south or towards the west saying i have been brought here with my eyes bound up i have been left here with my eyes bound up\n and as some one might remove his bandage and tell him the gandhara region is in this direction proceed in this direction and as he enquiring his way from village to village and being instructed and capable of judging by himself would reach the gandhara region itself even so in this world that person knows who has a preceptor\n and for him only so long is the delay as he is not liberated from the body and then immediately he is merged in being\n that being which is this subtle essence cause even that all this world has for its self\n that is the true\n that is the atman\n that you art o svetaketu\n revered sir please explain it further to me \n so be it dear boy said the father \n dear boy the relatives of a man who is ill assemble round him and ask do you recognise me do you recognise me as long as his speech is not merged in the mind the mind in prana prana in fire and fire in the supreme deity so long does he know them\n then when his speech is merged in the mind the mind in prana prana in fire and fire in the supreme deity then he does not know them\n that being which is this subtle essence cause even that all this world has for its self\n that is the true\n that is the atman\n that you art o svetaketu\n revered sir please explain it further to me \n so be it dear boy said the father \n dear boy the officers of the king bring a man holding him by the hand while saying he has taken something he has committed a theft heat the axe for him \n if he is doer of that then he makes himself false\n and being addicted to falsehood he covers himself with falsehood and grasps the heated axe he is burnt and then he is punished\n if however he is not the doer of that then he makes himself true\n and being attached to truth he covers himself with truth and grasps the heated axe he is not burnt and then he is released\n and as in this case he the man attached to truth is not burnt similarly a man of knowledge is not born again \n thus has all this world that for its self\n that is the true\n that is the atman\n that you art o svetaketu\n from his words svetaketu understood that yea he understood\n revered sir teach me thus saying narada approached sanatkumara\n sanatkumara said to him what you already know declaring that to me be my disciple\n what is beyond that i shall tell you\n narada said revered sir i know the rig veda the yajur veda the sama veda and the atharvanas the fourth the itihasa purana as the fifth grammar the rules for the worship of the ancestors mathematics the science of portents the science of treasures logic the science of ethics etymology the ancillary knowledge of the vedas the physical sciences the science of war the science of the stars the science related to serpents and the fine arts all this i know revered sir\n revered sir however i am only a knower of verbal texts not a knower of atman\n indeed i have heard from persons like your revered self that a knower of atman goes beyond grief\n i am in such a state of grief\n may your revered self take me across it\n sanatkumara replied to him whatsoever you have studied here really it is only a name\n name indeed is rig veda so also yajur veda sama veda and the atharvana as the fourth the itihasa purana as the fifth grammar the rules of the worship of the ancestors mathematics the science of portents the science of treasures logic the science of ethics etymology the ancillary knowledge of the vedas the physical science the science of war the science of the stars the science related to serpents and the fine arts name alone is all this\n he who worships name as brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of name he who worships name as brahman \n narada revered sir is there anything greater than name sanatkumara surely there is something greater than name \n narada revered sir communicate it to me\n speech surely is greater than name\n speech indeed makes us understand the rig veda yajurveda sama veda atharvana as the fourth itihasa purana as the fifth grammar the rules of the worship of the ancestors mathematics the science of portents the science of treasures logic the science of ethics etymology the ancillary knowledge of the vedas the physical science the science of war the science of the stars the science related to serpents and the fine arts also heaven and earth air and akasa water and fire gods and men cattle and birds grasses and trees beasts down to worms flying insects and ants merit and demerit true and false good and bad pleasant and unpleasant\n verily if speech did not exist neither merit nor demerit would be understood neither true nor false neither good nor bad neither pleasant nor unpleasant\n speech alone makes us understand all this\n hence worship speech\n he who worships speech as brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of speech he who worships speech as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than speech surely there is something greater than speech \n revered sir communicate it to me \n mind surely is greater than speech\n just as the closed hand encompasses two amalaka or two kola or two aksa fruits so does the mind encompasses speech and name\n when by mind one intends let me learn the mantras then he learns let me do sacrificial acts then he does let me desire offspring and cattle then he desires let me desire this world and the next then he desires\n mind indeed is atman\n mind indeed is the world\n mind indeed is brahman\n he who worships the mind as brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of mind he who worships the mind as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than mind surely there is something greater than mind \n revered sir communicate it to me \n will surely is greater than mind\n verily when one wills then he intends in his mind then he sends forth speech and he sends it forth in a name\n in the name sacred formulas and in sacred formulas the sacrifices become one\n all these indeed merge in the will are made up of the will and abide in the will\n heaven and earth willed air and akasa willed water and fire willed\n through the willing of these rain wills\n through the willing of rain food wills\n through the willing of food pranas will\n through the willing of pranas sacred formulas will\n through the willing of sacred formulas sacrificial acts will\n through the willing of sacrificial acts the world wills\n through the willing of the world all things will\n he who worships will as brahman he indeed attains the worlds willed by him himself being permanent the permanent worlds himself being well founded the well founded worlds himself being undistressed the undistressed world\n he becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of will he who worships will as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than will surely there is something greater than will \n revered sir communicate it to me \n intelligence surely is greater than will\n verily when one understands then he wills then he intends in mind then he sends forth speech and he sends it forth in a name\n in the name sacred formulas and in sacred formulas the sacrificed become one\n all these indeed merge in intelligence are made up of intelligence and abide in intelligence\n therefore even if a man who knows much is wiyout intelligence people speak of him thus he does not exist nor what he has known if he were really learned he would not thus be wiyout intelligence \n on the other hand if a man knowing little is endowed with intelligence people desire to listen to him also\n intelligence indeed is the one centre of mergence of all these intelligence is their soul and intelligence is their support\n he who worships intelligence as brahman he indeed attains the worlds of intelligence himself being permanent the permanent worlds himself being well established the well established worlds and himself being undistressed the undistressed world\n he becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of intelligence he who worships intelligence as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than intelligence surely there is something greater than intelligence \n revered sir communicate it to me \n contemplation surely is greater than intelligence\n the earth contemplates as it were\n the sky contemplates as it were\n heaven contemplates as it were\n water contemplates as it were\n the mountains contemplate as it were\n gods and men contemplate as it were\n therefore verily those who attain greatness among men here they seem to have obtained a share of the result of contemplation\n and those who are small people they are quarrelsome abusive and slanderous but those who are great men they appear to have obtained a share of the result of contemplation\n he who worships contemplation as brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of contemplation he who worships contemplation as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than contemplation surely there is something greater than contemplation \n revered sir communicate it to me \n understanding surely is greater than contemplation\n by understanding alone one understands the rig veda yajur veda sama veda atharvana as the fourth itihasa purana as the fifth grammar the rules for the worship of the ancestors mathematics the science of portents the science of treasures logic the vedas the physical science the science of war the science of the stars the science related to serpents and the fine arts also heaven and earth air and akasa water and fire gods and men cattle and birds grasses and trees beasts down to worms flying insects and ants merit and demerit true and false good and bad pleasant and unpleasant food and drink this world and the next all this one understands by understanding alone\n he who worships understanding as brahman attains the worlds containing the knowledge of the scriptures and other subjects\n he becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of understanding he who worships understanding as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than understanding surely there is something greater than understanding \n revered sir communicate it to me \n strength surely is greater than understanding\n a single man with strength causes even a hundred men with understanding to tremble\n when a man becomes strong then he rises rising he serves serving he approaches nearer approaching nearer he sees hears reflects understands acts and realizes\n by strength indeed the earth stands by strength the sky by strength heaven by strength the mountains by strength gods and men by strength cattle and birds grasses and trees beasts down to worms flying insects and ants by strength the world stands\n he who worships strength as brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of strength he who worships strength as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than strength surely there is something greater than strength \n revered sir ommunicate it to me \n food surely is greater than strength\n therefore if one does not eat for ten days even yough he might live yet verily he does not see does not hear does not reflect does not act and does not realize\n but with the coming of food he sees hears reflects understands acts and realizes\n he who worships food as brahman he verily attains the worlds supplied with food and drink\n he is free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of food he who worships food as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than food surely there is something greater than food \n revered sir communicate it to me \n water surely is greater than food\n therefore when there is not good rain living creatures are in agony thinking food will be scarce \n but when there is good rain living creatures become joyous thinking food will abound \n water indeed has assumed all these forms this earth this sky this heaven these mountains these gods and men these cattle and birds grasses and trees beasts down to worms flying insects and ants\n water indeed has assumed all these forms\n he who worships water as brahman obtains all desires and becomes sait isfied\n he becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of water he who worships water as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than water surely there is something greater than water \n revered sir communicate it to me \n fire surely is greater than water\n it is this fire that having seized the air warms up the akasa\n then people say it is hot it is burning hot it will surely rain \n there it is fire that shows itself first and then creates water\n it is because of this fire that thunders roll along with lightnings flashing upwards and across and so people say lightning is flashing it is thundering it will surely rain \n there it is fire that shows itself first and then creates water\n he who worships fire as brahman he being resplendent himself attains resplendent worlds full of light and free from darkness\n he becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of fire he who worships fire as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than fire surely there is something greater than fire \n revered sir communicate it to me \n akasa surely is greater than fire\n in akasa indeed exist both the sun and the moon lightning stars and fire\n through akasa one calls through akasa one hears through akasa one hears the response\n in akasa one rejoices in akasa one does not rejoice\n in akasa a thing is born and towards akasa it grows\n he who worships akasa as brahman he indeed attains vast worlds full of light unconfined and spacious\n he is free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of akasa he who worships akasa as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than akasa surely there is something greater than akasa \n revered sir communicate it to me \n memory surely is greater than akasa\n therefore even if many persons should assemble and if they should have no memory they surely would not hear any sound they would not think they would not know\n but surely should they have memory then they would hear then they would think then they would know\n through memory indeed one discerns one s sons through memory one s cattle\n he who worships memory as brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of memory he who worships memory as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than memory surely there is something greater than memory \n revered sir communicate it to me \n aspiration surely is greater than memory\n kindled by aspiration one s memory recites the hymns performs rites desires sons and cattle desires this world and the next\n he who worships aspiration as brahman by aspiration all his wishes prosper his prayers become infallible\n he is free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of aspiration he who worships aspiration as brahman \n revered sir is there anything greater than aspiration surely there is something greater than aspiration \n revered sir communicate it to me \n prana surely is greater than aspiration\n just as the spokes of the wheel are fastened to the nave so is all this fastened to this prana\n prana moves by prana prana gives prana and it gives prana\n prana is the father prana is the mother prana is the brother prana is the sister prana is the preceptor prana is the brahmana\n if one answers something harsh to his father mother brother sister preceptor or a brahmana people say this to him fie on you you are indeed a slayer of your father you are indeed a slayer of your mother you are indeed a slayer of your brother you are indeed a slayer of your sister you are indeed a slayer of your preceptor you are indeed a slayer of a brahmana\n on the other hand when the prana has departed from them even if one piles them together dismembers them with a fork and burns them up surely people would not say to him you are a slayer of your father nor you are a slayer of your mother nor you are a slayer of your brother nor you are a slayer of your sister nor you are a slayer of your preceptor nor you are a slayer of a brahmana \n prana indeed becomes all these\n he indeed who sees thus thinks thus and knows thus becomes a surpassing speaker\n if someone were to say to him you are a surpassing speaker he should say yes i am a surpassing speaker he should not deny it\n but he really speaks surpassingly who speaks surpassingly with truth \n revered sir being such i would speak surpassingly with truth \n but one must desire to understand the truth \n revered sir i desire to understand the truth \n when one understands then alone does one declare the truth\n wiyout understanding one does not declare the truth\n only he who understands declares the truth\n but one must desire to understand understanding\n revered sir i desire to understand understanding \n when one reflects then alone does one understand\n wiyout reflecting one does not understand\n only he who reflects understands\n but one must desire to understand reflection\n revered sir i desire to understand reflection \n when one has faith then alone does one reflect\n wiyout faith one does not reflect\n only he who has faith reflects\n but one must desire to understand faith \n revered sir i desire to understand faith \n when one has steadfastness then alone does one have faith\n wiyout steadfastness one does not have faith\n only he who has steadfastness has faith\n but one must desire to understand steadfastness\n revered sir i desire to understand steadfastness\n when one acts then alone does one become steadfast\n wiyout acting one does not become steadfast\n only on acting does one become steadfast\n but one must desire to understand activity \n revered sir i desire to understand activity \n when one obtains happiness then alone does one act\n wiyout obtaining happiness one does not act\n only on obtaining happiness does one act\n but one must desire to understand happiness \n revered sir i desire to understand happiness \n that which is infinite is alone happiness\n there is no happiness in anything finite\n the infinite alone is happiness\n but one must desire to understand the infinite \n revered sir i desire to understand the infinite \n in which one sees nothing else hears nothing else understands nothing else that is infinite\n but that in which one sees something else hears something else understands something else is the finite\n that which is infinite is alone immortal and that which is finite is mortal \n revered sir in what is that infinite established on its own greatness or not even on its own greatness \n here in this world people call cows and horses elephants and gold servants and wives fields and houses greatness \n i do not speak thus of greatness for in that case one thing would be established in another\n what i do say is thus that infinite alone is below\n that is in front\n that is to the south\n that is to the north\n that alone is all this\n so next is the teaching in regard to the self sense\n i alone am below\n i am in front\n i am to the south\n i am to the north\n i alone am all this\n so now is the teaching through atman\n atman alone is below\n atman is in front\n atman is to the south\n atman is to the north\n atman alone is all this\n verily he it is who sees thus and understands thus has pleasure in atman delight in atman union in atman joy in atman\n he becomes self sovereign he becomes free to act as he wishes in all the worlds\n but those who know otherwise than this are ruled by others and live in perishable worlds they are not free to act as they wish in all the worlds\n verily for him alone who sees thus reflects thus and understands thus prana springs from atman aspiration from atman memory from atman akasa from atman fire from atman water from atman appearance and disappearances from atman food from atman strength from atman understanding from atman contemplation from atman intelligence from atman will from atman mind from atman speech from atman name from atman hymns from atman rites from atman all this springs from atman alone\n there is this verse about it he who sees this does not see death nor illness nor any sorrow\n he who sees this sees all things and obtains all things in all ways\n he is one becomes threefold fivefold sevenfold and also ninefold\n then again he is called the elevenfold also a hundredand ten fold and also a yousand and twenty fold\n when nourishment is pure reflection and higher understanding become pure\n when reflection and higher understanding are pure memory becomes strong\n when memory becomes strong there is release from all the knots of the heart\n the revered sanatkumara showed to narada after his impurities had been washed off the further shore of darkness\n people call sanatkumara as skanda yea they call him skanda\n now in this city of brahman there is a mansion in the shape of a small lotus in it is a small inner akasa\n what is within that that should be sought that indeed one should desire to understand\n if the disciples should say to him in this city of brahman in which is a small mansion in the shape of a lotus and in the small inner akasa within what is it that lies there which should be sought which one should desire to understand he should say in reply as large indeed as is this akasa so large is that akasa in the heart\n within it indeed are contained both heaven and earth both fire and air both the sun and the moon lightning and the stars\n whatever there is of him in this world and whatever is not all that is contained within it\n if they should say to him if in this city of brahman is contained all this all beings and all desires then what is left of it when old age overtakes it or when it perishes he should say it the brahman called inner akasa does not age with the ageing of the body it is not killed by the killing of this\n this akasa is the real city of brahman in it are contained the desires\n this is the atman free from evil free from old age free from death free from sorrow free from hunger free from thirst whose desire is of the truth whose resolve is of the truth\n just as in this world the subjects follow as they are commanded and whatever province they desire be it a country or a part of the field on that they live\n so the ignorant depend upon others for enjoying the fruits of their karma \n just as here on earth the world which is earned by work perishes even so there in the other world the world which is earned by righteous deeds perishes\n so those who depart from here wiyout having understood the atman and these true desires for them there is no freedom to act as they wish in all the worlds\n but those who depart from here having understood the atman and these true desires for them there is freedom to act as they wish in all the worlds\n if he becomes desirous of the world of fathers by his mere will fathers arise\n possessed of that world of fathers he feels happy and exalted\n and if he becomes desirous of the world of mothers by his mere will mothers arise\n possessed of that world of mothers he feels happy and exalted\n and if he becomes desirous of the world of brothers by his mere will brothers arise\n possessed of that world of brothers he feels happy and exalted\n and if he becomes desirous of the world of sisters by his mere will sisters arise\n possessed of that world of sisters he feels happy and exalted\n and if he becomes desirous of the world of friends by his mere will friends arise\n possessed of that world of friends he feels happy and exalted\n and if he becomes desirous of the world of perfumes and garlands by his mere will of perfumes and garlands arise\n possessed of that world of perfumes and garlands he feels happy and exalted\n and if he becomes desirous of the world of food and drink by his mere will food and drink arise\n possessed of that world of food and drink he feels happy and exalted\n and if he becomes desirous of the world of song and music by his mere will song and music arise\n possessed of that world of song and music he feels happy and exalted\n and if he becomes desirous of the world of women by his mere will women arise\n possessed of that world of women he feels happy and exalted\n whatever provinces he is attached to and whatever desirable objects he desires by his mere will they arise\n possessed of that he feels happy and exalted\n these same are the true desires covdred by the untrue\n alyough the desires are true they are covered by the untrue\n for whosoever of one s people departs from here in this world one does not get him back to see\n but those of his people whether they are alive or dead and whatever else one desires but does not get all that one finds by going there into the atman the akasa in the heart for here indeed are those true desires of his covered by the untrue\n just as yough people who do not know the field walk again and again over the treasure of gold hidden underground but do not find it even so all these creatures here yough they go daily into the brahman world yet do not find it for they are carried away by the untrue\n this atean verily is in the heart\n its etymological explanation is this\n this atman is in the heart hence it is the heart\n he who knows thus indeed goes daily into the heavenly world\n now that serene and happy being rising out of this body and reaching the highest light appears in his own true form\n this is the atman said the teacher\n this is the immortal the fearless\n verily the name of this brahman is the true\n these are indeed the three syllables sa ti yam \n what is sa that is the immortal and what is ti that is the mortal and what is yam with it one holds the two together\n because with it one holds the two together therefore it is yam \n verily he who knows thus goes to the heavenly world\n now this atman is the dyke the embankment for the safety of these worlds\n this dyke neither the day nor the night crosses nor old age nor death nor sorrow nor merit nor demerit\n all evils turn back from it for this brahman world is free from evil\n therefore verily on reaching this dyke if one was blind he ceases to be blind if wounded he ceases to be wounded if afflicted he ceases to be afflicted\n therefore verily on reaching this dyke even night becomes day for this brahman world is ever illumined\n but only those who attain according to the iostruction this brahman world through brahmacharya to them belongs this brahman world\n for them there is freedom to act as they wish in all the worlds\n now what people call sacrifice is really brahmacharya for only by means of brahmacharya does the knower attain that world\n and what people call worship ista is really brahmacharya for only by worshipping with brahmacharya does one attain the atman\n now what people call the sacrificial session is really brahmacharya for only by means of brahmacharya does one obuain one s salvation from being\n and what people call the vow of silence is really brahmacharya for only through brahmacharya does one understand the atman and then meditate\n now what people call a course of fasting is really brahmacharya for this atman never perishes which one attains by means of brahmacharya\n and what people call the life of a hermit is really brahmacharya for verily ara and nya are the two oceans in the brahman world in the third heaven from here and therein is the lake airammadiya and there is the aparajita unconquered city of brahma and there is the gold hall specially built by the lord\n therefore only those who attain the two oceans ara and nya in the brahman world by means of brahmacharya only to them belongs this brahman world and for them there is freedom to act as they wish in all the worlds\n now these arteries which belong to the heart exist filled with the juice of a fine substance which is reddish brown white blue yellow and red\n the yonder sun indeed is reddish brown he is white he is blue he is yellow he is red\n just as an extending highway runs between two villages this as well as that even so the rays of the sun go to both these worlds this as well as that\n they spread out of the yonder sun and enter into these arteries\n out of these arteries they spread and enter into the yonder sun\n therefore when one is thus sound sleep composed serene so that he knows no dreams then he enters into the akasa of the heart through these arteries\n then no evil touches him for then he is filled with the light of the sun\n now when one is thus reduced to a weakened condition those who sit around him say do you know me do you know me as long as he has not departed from this body so long he knows them\n but when he thus departs from this body then he proceeds upwards through those very rays if a knower he surely goes up meditating on om or does not got up if he is not a knower \n as long as it takes for the mind to travel in that short time he goes to the sun\n that indeed is the door to the world of brahman an entrance for the knowers and a shutting out for the ignorant\n there is this verse about it a hundred and one are the arteries of the heart one of them leads up to the crown of the head\n passing upwards through that one attains immortality while the other arteries serve for departing in various other directions yea serve for departing\n the atman which is free from evil free from old age free from death free from sorrow free from hunger and thirst whose desire is of the truth whose resolve is of the truth he should be sought him one should desire to understand\n he who has found out and who understands that atman attains all the worlds and all the desires\n both the gods and the demons heard this and said well let us seek that atman by seeking which one attains all the worlds and all the desires\n then indra alone from among the gods went out and so did virochana from among the demons\n then wiyout communicating with each other they both came into the presence of prajapati fuel in hand\n for thirty two years they lived there the disciplined life of a celibate student of sacred knowledge\n then prajapati asked them desiring what have you been living they replied the atman which is free from evil free from old age free from death free from sorrow free from hunger and thirst whose desire is of the truth whose resolve is of the truth he should be sought him one should desire to understand\n he who has found out and who understands that atman attain all the worlds and all the desires these are known to be the words of your revered self\n desiring that atman we have been living\n prajapati said to them the person which is seen in the eye is the atman \n he added this is the immortal the fearless\n but revered sir he who is perceived in water and he who in a mirror which of these is the atman it is he himself that is perceived in all these replied prajapati\n look at yourself in a pan of water and whatever you do not understand of the atman tell me that \n then they looked in a pan of water\n prajapati asked them what do you see they replied revered sir we both see the self entirely as we are the very image even to the very hairs and nails\n then prajapati said to them having become well adorned well dressed and well groomed look into the pan of water\n they too having become well adorned well dressed and well groomed looked into the pan of water\n then prajapati asked them what do you see they replied just as we are ourselves revered sir well adorned well dressed and well groomed even so are both these revered sir well adorned well dressed and well groomed\n this is the atman said he this is the immortal the fearless\n they both went away sait isfied in their hearts\n then prajapati looked at them and said they are going away wiyout having perceived wiyout having understood the atman\n whosoever will follow such a doctrine be they gods or demons they will be foiled\n now virochana sait isfied in his heart went to the demons and declared this doctrine to them\n here the bodily self alone is to be worshipped the self is to be attended upon\n here it is only by worshipping the self and attending upon the self that one obtains both the worlds this as well as the yonder\n therefore even to this day here people say of one who is not a giver who has no faith who does not perform sacrifices oh he is a demon for this is the doctrine of the demons\n they adorn the body of the deceased with enjoyable things clothes and ornaments for by this they think they will win the other world\n but indra even before reaching the gods saw this difficulty just as this reflected self becomes well adorned when this body is well adorned well dressed when the body is well dressed well groomed when the body is well groomed even so this reflected self also becomes blind when the body is blind one eyed when the body is one eyed crippled when the body is crippled and it perishes when this body perishes\n i see no good in this\n he came back again fuel in hand\n prajapati asked him desiring what o indra have you come back since you went away sait isfied in your heart along with virochana indra replied revered sir just as this reflected self becomes well adorned when this body is well adorned well dressed when the body is well dressed well groomed when the body is well groomed even so this reflected self also becomes blind when the body is blind one eyed when the body is one eyed crippled when the body is crippled and it perishes when this body perishes\n i see no good in this\n so is it indeed o indra said prajapati however i shall explain this further to you\n live here for another thirty two years\n he lived there for another thirty two years\n then prajapati said to him prajapati said he who moves about in dreams he is the atman\n he is the immortal the fearless\n indra went away sait isfied in his heart\n but even before reaching the gods he saw this difficulty even yough this dream self is not blind when this body is blind nor one eyed when the body is slain nor has running nose and eyes when the body has running nose and eyes yet it is as if they kill it as if they chase it it becomes conscious of pain as it were and even weeps as it were\n i see no good in this \n he came back again fuel in hand\n prajapati asked him desiring what o indra have you come back since you went away sait isfied in your heart he replied revered sir even yough this self is not blind when this body is blind nor one eyed when the body is one eyed nor suffers defects from the defects of the body nor is slain when the body is slain nor has running nose and eyes yet it is as if they kill it as if they chase it it becomes conscious of pain as it were and even weeps as it were\n i see no good in this \n so is it indeed o indra said prajapati however i shall explain this further to you\n live here for another thirty two years\n he lived there for another thirty two years\n then prajapati said to him prajapati said he who is fully asleep composed serene and knows no dream he is the atman\n he is the immortal the fearless\n indra went away sait isfied in his heart\n but even before reaching the gods he saw this difficulty in truth this one does not know himself now as i am he nor indeed these beings\n it seems as if he has gone to annihilation\n i see no good in this \n he came back again fuel in hand\n prajapati asked him desiring what o indra have you come back since you went away sait isfied in your heart he replied revered sir in truth this one does not know himself as i am he nor indeed these beings\n it seems as if he has gone to annihilation\n i see no good in this \n so is it indeed o indra said prajapati however i shall explain this further to you and none other than this\n live here for another five years\n he lived there for another five years\n that makes one hundred and one years and so with regard to that people say thus verily for one hundred and one years indra lived with prajapati the disciplined life of a celibate student of sacred knowledge \n then prajapati said to him o indra mortal indeed is this body held by death\n but it is the support of this deathless bodiless atman\n verily the embodied self is held by pleasure and pain\n surely there is no cessation of pleasure and pain for one who is embodied\n but pleasure and pain do not indeed touch one who is bodiless\n bodiless is air and white cloud lightning thunder these also are bodiless\n now as these arise out of the yonder akasa reach the highest light and appear each with its own form even so this serene one rises out of this body reaches the highest light and appears in his own form\n he is the highest person\n there he moves about laughing playing rejoicing with women vehicles or relations not remembering this body in which he was born\n as an animal is attached to a chariot even so is the prana attached to this body\n now where the sight merges in akasa inside the eye i\n the black pupil of the eye there exists that which is the person in the eye and the eye is only for his seeing\n and he who knows i smell this is the atman the nose is for smelling\n and he who knows i speak this is the atman the organ of speech is for speaking\n and he who knows i hear this is the atman the ear is for hearing\n and he who knows i think this is the atman the mind is his divine eye\n through this divine eye of the mind he verily sees these desired objects which are in the brahman world and rejoices\n verily this is the atman whom the gods worship\n therefore all the worlds and all the desired objects are held by them\n he obtains all the worlds all the desired objects who having known that atman from the teacher and the scriptures understands it\n thus spoke prajapati yea thus spoke prajapati\n from the dark i attain to the variegated from the variegated i attain to the dark\n shaking off evil as a horse his hairs shaking off the body as the moon frees itself from the mouth of rahu i having fulfilled all ends obtain the eternal brahman world yea i obtain it\n verily what is called akasa is the revealer of name and form\n that within which they are is brahman that is the immortal that is the atman\n i attain to the assembly hall and abode of prajapati\n i am the glory of the brahmanas the glory of the kshatriyas the glory of the vaisyas\n i wish to attain that glory\n i am the glory of the glories\n may i never go to that which is reddish white and toothless yet devouring and slippery yea may i never go to it\n brahma expounded this to prajapati\n prajapati to manu and manu to his descendants\n he who has read the veda according to the prescribed rule in the time left over after performing his duties to the teacher he who after having come back from the teacher s house settles down in his household continues the study of the veda in a clean place and has virtuous sons and disciples he who withdraws all his senses into the atman who pracit ises non injury to all beings except in places specially ordained he who behaves thus throughout his life reaches the world of brahman and does not return again yea he does not return again\n om let my limbs and speech prana eyes ears vitality and all the senses grow in strength\n all existence is the brahman of the upanishads\n may i never deny brahman nor brahman deny me\n let there be no denial at all let there be no denial at least from me\n may the virtues that are proclaimed in the upanishads be in me who am devoted to the atman may they reside in me\n om peace peace peace here ends the chandogyopanishad as contained in the sama veda\n commentary on the chandogya upanishad by swami nirmalananda giri the glory of om in this commentary i will be mostly using the translation of swami prabhavananda\n in his translations of some upanishads swami prabhavananda omitted some parts many that were in such obscure language that any attempt at translation would really only be speculation\n he also omitted very repetitious passages and those that dwelt with matters irrelevant to the knowledge of brahman and the self\n that is why in the references to the verses of this upanishad there will be some jumping around\n however prabhavananda omitted some passages that i think are extremely important\n so i will be supplementing his translation\n meditation on om one should meditate on the syllable om the udgitha\n of this the explanation follows\n this leaves us little doubt as to what the author or authors of the chandogya upanishad consider the subject of prime importance meditation on om\n udgitha is the technical ritual term for om when it is sung aloud in vedic recitation\n so in the subsequent verses i am just going to put om wherever udgitha occurs\n the supreme essence the essence of man is speech\n the essence of speech is the hymns of the rig veda\n their essence is the hymns of the sama veda\n the essence of the sama veda is om\n that which marks human beings out from the lesser forms of evolution is the power of vak of symbolic creative speech\n most animals make some kinds of sounds that indicate their feelings but only humans have symbolic words that recount and stimulate both yought and behavior\n this is the power of logos spoken of in greek philosophy and eastern christian writings\n it is not just a simple trait but a virtual intellectual ocean that separates us from other sentient beings on earth\n it is as said a product of evolution and skill in speech is the mark of an evolved human being yough the most important ability is that of creative yought conceptualization\n vak is what makes us human\n the highest form of speech is that of the hymns of the rig veda that were revealed in meditation untold yousands of years ago to the vedic rishis seers \n the highest of those hymns were collected into the sama veda whose text is marked pointed for devotional singing\n and the supreme essence of the sama veda hymns is the single syllable om\n in many texts it is stated that to intone om is to recite all the vedic hymns\n therefore the syllable om which is called udgitha is the quintessence of the essences the supreme deserving of the highest place\n this can be said because om is the primal word the original sound the first word spoken by god and by which all that is was created and is being sustained and evolved at this very moment\n the vedic seers long ago stated in the beginning was prajapati god the creator with him was the word and the word was truly the supreme brahman\n prajapati vai idam agra asit\n tasya vak dvitiya asit\n vag vai paramam brahman\n krishna yajurveda kathaka samhita \n krishna yajurveda kathakapisthala samhita \n jaiminiya brahmana ii samaveda this was much later paraphrased in the opening verses of the gospel of saint john in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god\n the same was in the beginning with god\n john chandogya upanishad \n says that brahma the creator concentrated his awareness on the worlds he had projected and from them thus brooded upon issued forth as their essence the syllable om\n just as all the parts of the leaf are permeated by the ribs of the leaf so are all the words permeated by the syllable om\n verily the syllable om is all this yea the syllable om is verily all this\n everything is contained in om as other upanishadic texts enumerate including all the possible states of consciousness the expanse of time past present future the three worlds physical astral causal all\n the upanishadic teaching is that om is identical with brahman itself\n how then can we regard it as anything other than the quintessence of the essences the supreme deserving of the highest place the divine union speech vak and breath prana taken together form a couple\n this couple is joined together in the syllable om\n whenever a couple come together they indeed fulfill each other s desire\n this is a most important fact and one that is explained very fully in the fourth chapter breath and sound in meditation of om yoga its theory and practice\n fulfiller of desires he who meditates upon om knowing it thus as the fulfiller verily becomes a fulfiller of all the desirable ends\n that verily is the syllable of assent for whenever one assents to a thing one says only om \n assent alone is prosperity\n he who meditates upon om knowing it thus as endowed with the quality of prosperity verily becomes one who increases all the desirable ends\n this is important for two reasons\n first that om contains within itself creative power and is creative power\n naturally we must both know how to employ it and to be of such a level of consciousness that we can do with it what god does with it\n this is certainly possible\n i have known yogis who could heal with om and do many other magical things that were really quite normal for the person who knew how\n that is why this section is concluded with these words whatever is performed with knowledge faith and meditation becomes more effective\n up to this truly is the explanation of the second important point is that the yogi need not be a person who lives in a bare subsistence manner unworldly impractical and indifferent to all material things including his body\n the opposite is true\n in the eighth chapter of this upanishad we find these verses if the sage desires to see his fathers of the spirit world lo his fathers come to meet him\n in their company he is happy\n and if he desires to see his mothers of the spirit world lo his mothers come to meet him\n in their company he is happy\n and if he desires to see his brothers of the spirit world lo his brothers come to meet him\n in their company he is happy\n and if he desires to see his sisters of the spirit world lo his sisters come to meet him\n in their company he is happy\n and if he desires to see his friends of the spirit world lo his friends come to meet him\n in their company he is happy\n and if he desires heavenly perfumes and garlands lo heavenly perfumes and garlands come to him\n in their possession he is happy\n and if he desires heavenly food and drink lo heavenly food and drink come to him\n in their possession he is happy\n and if he desires heavenly song and music lo heavenly song and music come to him\n in their possession he is happy\n indeed whatsoever such a knower of brahman may desire straightway it is his and having obtained it he is exalted of men\n such is the real yogi the true adept\n i remember a recording of paramhansa yogananda in which he spoke about how many mortgages he had paid off how much property he had bought and how large a family he had supported for decades\n i could have kept away a million dollars and no one would have known he said speaking of the abundance that had come to him after enduring great hardship and remaining faithful to the ideals he had been sent to america to teach and practice\n a bengali song in his honor says going far away you taught dharma\n and that dharma which you taught you showed perfectly in your life\n then he told his hearers that despite all the financial outlay he only had a little box that was never empty by god s grace and he never bothered to count how much was in it\n one of india s greatest yogis was janaka whose name is invoked as the symbol of tremendous wealth as well as wisdom\n they speak of janaka in india as we do of midas in the west\n such is om such are those that meditate upon it\n the gods and om throughout the upanishads gita and other spiritual texts we find references to gods in sanskrit devas\n a brief sanskrit glossary defines deva in this way a shining one a god greater or lesser in the evolutionary hierarchy a semi divine or celestial being with great powers and therefore a god\n sometimes called a demi god\n devas are the demigods presiding over various powers of material and psychic nature\n in many instances devas refer to the powers of the senses or the sense organs themselves\n the sun now the meditation on om with reference to the gods is described\n one should meditate on the sun as om\n verily when he rises he sings aloud for the sake of all creatures\n we should skip ahead a little bit to continue this subject\n now that which is om is verily pranava and that which is pranava is om\n the yonder sun is om and also pranava for he moves along pronouncing om\n that is the energy of the sun is a manifestation of om\n scienit ists have only recently discovered this phenomenon\n on page of the july issue of national geographic we find this bubbles the size of texas cover the sun s face \n called granules the short lived cells of plasma carry heat to the surface through convection the same way water boils in a pot\n the rise and fall of granules creates sound waves which cause the sun to throb like a drum every five minutes\n in the word that is god we find the following comment all plant animal and human life on this planet depends upon the sun\n it is the subtle powers of sunlight which stimulate growth and evolution\n sunlight particularly stimulates the activity of the higher centers in the brain especially that of the pineal gland\n even in the depths of the earth a sensitive man can tell when the sun rises and sets above him\n the sun truly awakens us in the deepest sense\n as the germinating seed struggles upward toward the sun and out into its life giving rays so all higher forms of life reach out for the sun which acts as a metaphysical magnet drawing them upward and outward toward ever expanding consciousness\n sunlight is the radiant form of om\n the sun initiates the entire solar system into om\n human beings are solar creatures therefore to intone om is the most natural things they can do\n later the upanishad says reflect upon om as the rays of the sun\n further on we find a section that speaks of the divine person purusha who ensouls and enlivens the sun ishwara\n now that person effulgent as gold who is seen within the sun who is with golden beard and golden hair is exceedingly effulgent even to the very tips of his nails\n his eyes are bright like a red lotus\n he is above all evils\n verily he who knows thus rises above all evils\n moreover he controls the worlds which are above that sun as also the desires of the gods\n even further on we are told that om is like the flower of the sun\n when the yogi bees pressed this pranava from it thus pressed issued forth as juice fame splendor of limbs alertness of the senses virility and nourishment\n the most important aspect of the solar connection with om is found in the eighth section of the upanishad\n there it speaks of the nadis the subtle energy channels that function in the subtle bodies of human beings\n then it says that just as an extending highway runs between two villages this as well as that even so the rays of the sun go to both these worlds this as well as that\n they spread out of the yonder sun and enter into these nadis\n out of these nadis they spread and enter into the yonder sun\n regarding one who meditates on om the upanishad continues when he thus departs from this body then he proceeds upwards through those very rays\n he surely goes up meditating on om\n as long as it takes for the mind to travel in that time he goes to the sun\n that indeed is the door to the world of brahman an entrance for the knowers and a shutting out for the ignorant\n those who pass through the sun are free from the compulsion to rebirth on the earth\n om the breath and om the connection between the sun and our breath is next described\n this breath and that sun are the same\n therefore one should meditate on this breath and that sun as om\n this is why in om yoga we join our intonations of om with the breath\n the upanishad continues now with reference to the body one should meditate on the breath as om for he moves along pronouncing om\n thinking thus sing praise to om as the manifold pranas\n now that which is om is verily pranava and that which is pranava is om so one should think\n escaping death now we have a parable about rising above the realm of death samsara\n one should meditate on the syllable om\n of this the explanation follows\n verily the gods being afraid of death took refuge in the three vedas\n just as a fisherman would see a fish in water so did death observe the gods in the vedic hymns\n they too knowing this arose and entered om\n this syllable om is indeed immortality and fearlessness\n having entered into om the gods became immortal and fearless\n he who worships this syllable knowing it thus enters this syllable which is immortality and fearlessness\n and having entered it he becomes immortal by that amrita om by which the gods became immortal\n the devas gods are all the aspects of the human being\n those who seek life and immortality in external rites indeed in anything other than brahman will be caught in the net of death just like fish in the fisherman s net\n but when they take refuge in the meditation of om they rise above the realm of even the possibility of death\n of course this may also be a story of highly evolved beings who found that they were still subject to death in the higher worlds being forced to drop the subtle bodies proper to those realms and enter bodies on lesser levels or worlds\n at the mahapralaya the great universal dissolution all the worlds are shaken and dissolve away\n the wise knowing that do not content themselves with living in carefree and beautiful wish fulfilling worlds but busy themselves with tapasya to ascend beyond relativity\n and they do this through meditation on om\n and so should we\n the sages and om the upanishad gives some very interesting views on om in the form of a discussion between three sages\n we will look at a condensed version\n in ancient times there were three proficient in om silaka the son of salavat caikitayana of the dalbhya family and pravahana the son of jivala\n they said we are proficient in om\n if you agree let us enter on a discussion of om\n let it be so saying this they sat down\n ether akasha om is a sound rising from the heart of all things and the element of ether akasha which is its highest form is consciousness is the basis of all sound\n ultimately om and consciousness are the same thing\n a brief sanskrit glossary defines akasha in this way ether space sky literally not visible\n the subtlest of the five elements panchabhuta from which the other four arise\n it is all pervading and is sometimes identified with consciousness chidakasha\n it is the basis of sound shabda which is its particular property\n this being so the dialogue proceeds as follows what is the essence of this world akasha\n all these beings arise from akasha alone and are finally dissolved into akasha because akasha alone is greater than all these and akasha is the support at all times\n remember om is the subject of this discussion and since akasha is the foundation of sound it moves on with this it is this om which is progressively higher and better\n this again is endless\n he who knowing thus meditates upon the progressively higher and better om obtains progressively higher and better lives and wins progressively higher and better worlds\n om is the thread that runs through all levels of existence it is the core of all worlds emanating from the absolute that is beyond them all\n by meditating on om we ascend higher and higher passing through the states of consciousness that correspond to higher and higher worlds\n whatever the state of mind we are established in at the time of death it will take us into the corresponding world\n whatever state of being bhavam he remembers when he gives up the body at the end he invariably goes to that state of being transformed into that state of being\n bhagavad gita there is another aspect to this\n in meditation our perceptions of om become subtler and subtler\n from being a mental repetition sounding just like it would if we were speaking aloud it becomes softer and softer even whisperlike eventually become a silent ideation or conceptualization while mysteriously remaining a complete word\n this mutation takes place as our consciousness is moving into higher and higher states of being or bhavas\n our experiencing of this is experiencing om and the states of awareness inherent in it\n the conclusion the upanishad sums it up like this atidhanvan the son of sunaka having taught this to udarasandilya said as long as among your descendants this knowledge of om continues so long their life in this world will be progressively higher and better than ordinary lives\n and in that other world also their state will be similar \n he who knows and meditates thus his life in this world surely becomes progressively higher and better and so also his state in that other world yea in that other world\n four things god really wants you to know have you ever seen or been given a little leaflet entitled four things god wants you to know when i was young long ago it was quite a popular tool of fundamentalist protestants\n it had four statements mostly about sin death and hell backed up with bible quotations\n usually there was a place to sign on the back saying you were willing to let god save you\n and that was it salvation for the masses\n here in the chandogya upanishad we find the real four things we all need to know\n duty and realization the requirements of duty dharma are three\n the first is sacrifice study almsgiving the second is austerity the third is life as a student in the home of a teacher and the practice of continence\n together these three lead one to the realm of the blest\n but he who is firmly established in the knowledge of brahman achieves immortality\n chandogya upanishad the basis of dharma of life that leads to spiritual unfoldment has three elements which need scrutiny each in turn\n sacrifice study and almsgiving\n sacrifice yajna means formal religious observance especially the offering of the daily activities to god hopefully leading to the perfect offering of oneself to god ishwarapranidhana\n study adhyaya means just that but study of spiritual texts of the wisdom of the enlightened and pondering the ways to incorporate that teaching into one s own life\n this is serious application to holy knowledge and its personal assimilation\n almsgiving dana means giving of time and money to the welfare of others\n it is also the cultivation of generosity as a trait of mind and heart\n these three are discussed in the bhagavad gita especially in chapter seventeen as absolute necessities on the spiritual path never to be abandoned not even by the renunciate\n for these are not part of worldly life but essentials of spiritual life\n austerity tapasya is spiritual discipline including control of mind body the factors of external life and especially meditation\n it is an entire reshaping and purification of the inner and outer life not a mere dabbling or dalliance\n it is total in its scope and therefore total in its effect\n life as a student in the home of a teacher and the practice of continence\n it is a fact that the earlier we begin spiritual cultivation the more likely we are to persevere and therefore succeed\n in the ancient culture of india from an early age everyone lived as a religious student in the house of a recognized spiritual teacher\n alyough the teacher imparted a great deal of practical world oriented knowledge the primary subject was always spiritual life and development through spiritual practice and religious activities\n since the student remained in the teacher s house until the attainment of adulthood brahmaacharya sexual continence was considered a fundament requisite so much so that the student was called a brahmaachari one who observes continence\n in the west this system was totally unknown in the indian form but through the centuries it was not uncommon for monasteries and convents to permit children to live there and study some becoming monastics and others leaving and leading a secular life\n the franciscan order had minor seminaries in which young boys began preparation for religious life especially the priesthood from a very young age\n if one decided that he did not wish to eventually be a monk or priest he usually returned home and continued an ordinary course of study\n but here in the west the majority of those following sanatana dharma come to it as adults\n they can engage in sacrifice study charity and spiritual practice but what about this factor which the upanishad says is a requirement of dharma besides the general study of the basic scriptures of india such persons will need to devote themselves to a particular form of spiritual cultivation\n for example someone can take up the study of teachings relating to a specific approach such as the familiar paths of karma bhakti and jnana\n they may center their attention on a particular teacher such as shankara ramanuja sri ramakrishna vivekananda ramana maharshi paramhansa yogananda swami bhaktivedanta or a contemporary teacher of which there are many\n even if a teacher is no longer in the body through study and application of his teaching they can be his student\n the home of a teacher is not a building or ashram but that teacher s level of spiritual awareness\n it is not easy to live in that real home but it can and must be done\n only those who attune themselves to the teacher s consciousness are true disciples\n physical proximity of itself means nothing\n in india i have seen people that lived for decades in an ashram often personally attending on or travelling with the teacher and many of them never really met the teacher once on the level that counts\n for all students of whatever form or situation brahmaacharya is needed\n a teacher that does not tell them that right from the start is no real teacher at all\n the blest and the blesser together these three lead one to the realm of the blest\n but he who is firmly established in the knowledge of brahman achieves immortality\n honesty in spiritual life is a necessity on the side of the teacher and the student\n true spiritual teaching is not a matter of marketing of appealing to the consumer\n therefore facts that may not be palatable or comforting are always to be found wherever truth is being taught\n degenerate religion revels in adjusting and dumbing down it teachings in order to gain more adherents and therefore more power and money\n true religion always follows the fundamental principle that the seeker conforms to the teaching not the other way around\n all of us really need to get this through our heads and into our hearts and thereby into our lives\n i say this because we see that the upanishadic sage tells us the truth about what has been commended to us they will take us into the realm of the blest\n now he does not mean the earthlike heaven of most religions but the realm of the wise and holy who have evolved to the point where earthly rebirth is no longer needed\n they and those who ascend there are liberated from that bondage but they are still subject to rebirth in the higher worlds of which there is a seemingly infinite number\n so painless as it is and happy as are the worlds involved in our subtle births and deaths we are still bound and subject to departing and returning\n it is a higher and happy portion of the evolutionary ladder but still not our transcendental home beyond the ladder for which attainment we originally came forth into relative existence\n so we must assiduously engage in the sacred three in order that we may at least become freed from earthly bonds but always keeping in mind that there is something more needed the knowledge of not just about brahman\n and we should be striving for that as well\n so there really should be four elements in our endeavor\n only the knower of brahman has immortality for only he is freed from birth and death in all forms\n the light within the light of the self the light that shines above the heavens and above this world the light that shines in the highest world beyond which there are no others that is the light that shines in the hearts of men\n gambhirananda now that light which shines beyond this heaven beyond the whole creation beyond everything in the highest worlds which are unsurpassingly good it is certainly this which is the light within a person\n it is the atma jyoti the light of the self which is also divinity itself\n as a student of the upanishadic wisdom through his master jesus saint john wrote this then is the message which we have heard of him jesus and declare unto you that god is light\n i john that light is purely spiritual spirit actually beyond the light we see in this world but which nevertheless is also a manifestation or extension of that light as is the entire creation\n in all the worlds and beyond all the worlds it is the one light that shines in and as all\n what a glorious concept a truth as profound as it is simple\n the lord shall be unto you an everlasting light and your god your glory\n isaiah this was the essene teaching which jesus received even in infancy\n original christianity which was identical with sanatana dharma taught that the divine light was the light of men\n the true light which lighteth every man john wiyout exception\n that light cannot be alienated from us but is ever the essence of our existence making us the children of light\n john this is the real gospel the good news of real religion\n the light that is brahman this light is transcendent because god is transcendent and so are we because truly has this universe come forth from brahman\n in brahman it lives and has its being\n assuredly all is brahman\n let a man freed from the taint of passion worship brahman alone\n again gambhirananda all this is brahman\n this is born from dissolves in and exists in that\n therefore one should meditate by becoming calm\n really what can or need be said about this incredible assertion all is brahman what we can consider is the final part the practical advice which in the sanskrit text is only two words shanta upasita\n literally they mean draw near peacefully or go near peacefully\n upasana means to sit or draw near and is usually understood to mean either worship or meditation\n in the greek original of the new testament the word translated prayer is prosevki which also means to draw near\n the greek word translated worship is proskuneo which has the same meaning\n the important thing to realize is that true worship and meditation are both an inner process for god is the light that shines within each one of us as the first verse quoted points out\n so to draw near to that light we must turn within\n as jesus said neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you\n luke the inner search must be done shanta peacefully\n this is a major key in yoga\n all meditation must be done calmly and carefully otherwise it will be impossible to perceive and assimilate the subtle states of awareness which meditation should produce\n the mind must be as still as a mirror to really meditate and meditation alone produces that stillness\n meditation is being described by saint paul when he says we all with open face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory\n ii corinthians that is why in the book of revelation which paramhansa yogananda said was a book about yoga it says that a sea of glass like a great mirror is before the throne of god and that the saints stand upon it\n this symbolizes the perfectly still mind of the yogi by which he experiences higher realities\n revelation the yogi s will now the second half of the verse we just examined a man is above all his will\n as is his will in this life so does he become when he departs from it\n therefore should his will be fixed on attaining brahman\n this is surely one of the most important statements in the upanishads\n the will is the highest faculty we possess\n it is higher even than the intellect for we often say i won t think about that right now and we do not because the will controls it\n the only thing higher than the will is the self\n the will approaches closer to the self than any other aspect of our being\n this is so important because the quality of our religion and our yoga is determined by which aspect is the basis of our belief and practice\n we have five levels or bodies\n they are the physical material body annamaya kosha the magnetic or bio energetic body pranamaya kosha the sensory mind manomaya kosha the intelligent mind the intellect jnanamaya kosha and the will anandamaya kosha \n these also correspond to the five elements earth prithvi water apa fire agni air vayu and ether akasha which are also the seats of the five senses smell taste sight touch and hearing\n the will is the anandamaya kosha which corresponds to the ether element whose special faculty is sound shabda both the passive faculty of hearing and the active faculty of speech\n which is why the highest yoga is based on sound specifically the highest sound om\n om yoga is the way to correct and develop the will\n since we are our will according to the upanishad it must be made alive through the continual japa and meditation of the pranava the word of life om\n only through om can we gain mastery of the will and thereby of ourselves\n we must become om the word that is god according to the bhagavad gita \n i am the sacred syllable om\n by becoming om we become god not in the absolute sense but in the relative sense of knowing ourselves as an eternal part of god identical in essence even yough not the whole\n if in this life we become united to brahman when we leave this world we will go to brahman\n then satyakama son of shibi asked him the rishi pippalada venerable sir what world does he who meditates on om until the end of his life win by that to him he said that which is the sound om o satyakama is verily the higher and the lower brahman\n therefore with this support alone does the wise man reach the one or the other\n if he meditates on the supreme being parampurusha with the syllable om he becomes one with the light the sun\n he is led to the world of brahman\n he sees the person that dwells in the body who is higher than the highest life\n that the wise one attains even by the mere sound om as support that which is tranquil unaging immortal fearless and supreme\n when a man leaves his body and departs let him take refuge in steady concentration uttering the sacred syllable om and meditating upon me\n such a man reaches the highest goal\n bhagavad gita you can t get more detailed or more authoritative than that\n therefore should his will be fixed on attaining brahman concludes this verse\n for as krishna said when a yogi has meditated upon me unceasingly for many years with an undistracted mind i am easy of access to him because he is always absorbed in me\n bhagavad gita this is the way\n the self within the self who is to be realized by the purified mind and the illumined consciousness whose form is light whose youghts are true who like the ether remains pure and unattached from whom proceed all works all desires all odors all tastes who pervades all who is beyond the senses and in whom there is fullness of joy forever he is my very self dwelling within the lotus of my heart\n rejoicing in the self it can reasonably be felt that the bhagavad gita is more important than the upanishads because it not only embodies their teachings it provides practical advice for their personal realization\n this is also my opinion but the upanishads are certainly indispensable for us who seek the goal\n one of their most wonderful aspects and one that i have never heard mentioned in my nearly half a century of sanatana dharma study is their marvelous ecstatic exulting in the wonder and glory of the self\n just reading such joyful declarations produces a powerful stirring of the will towards perseverance in the divine search\n this verse is one such rapturous affirmation and well worth our savoring carefully\n the self who\n the self is a who not a what\n that is the self is a conscious person or more accurately a person who is consciousness itself\n of course the self individual or universal is not the ego a conditioned personality but a changeless consciousness\n it is certainly true that the self is not personal or even a person in the way we know those terms\n it is a transcendent reality of one essence with the absolute reality\n but it is conscious and it is real\n this is bedrock truth\n countless ages of realization are behind this principle\n we may not understand it fully or flawlessly but that is only our human limitation\n it is eternal truth\n that is the truth being presented in this verse a truth that brings profound joy to those who realize it\n it is said that shiva sits immersed in the self but that sometimes he arises and dances singing o who i am who i am is to be realized\n we realize the self we do not find it because it is ever present it is us\n that is we enter into and experience our eternal nature\n we have always had it but have lost touch with it\n there is nothing to reach out for rather we need to regain perception of it\n it is more here and now than anything else because it is the here and now\n it is only a matter of seeing of experiencing it and not as an object but as the subject\n ultimately it is beyond description but what can be said is glorious\n by the purified mind\n mind does not mean the sensory mind manas or even the intellect buddhi but the principle of consciousness itself prajna \n the simile of a mirror is very apt here\n covered with thick dust and dirt the mirror is no more than a lump of earth or a slab of wood\n but the more the debris is removed the more things are seen on its surface until it shines forth in its reflective nature\n in the same way our consciousness or rather the glass that covers it must be cleansed so there is no obstruction to our perception of the self\n that is why jesus said blessed are those that are pure katharos clean clear pure at the center of their being kardia heart core center for they shall see god\n matthew and saint john said every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure\n i john the path of this necessary purification is fully outlined in the yoga sutras yoga darshan of patanjali\n and the illumined consciousness\n the self is consciousness that is swayam prakash self illumined\n that is its very nature is light jyoti \n by its presence it illuminates all its upadhis its various bodies\n being life as well as light it also makes them live through its nearness to them just as the presence of brahman makes the worlds alive\n but it too is illumined and enlivened by its essential unity with the supreme light the supreme life brahman\n so it both illumines and is illumined\n whose form is light\n the word form should really be in quotes for neither brahman nor the atman have a form in the way that is understood in relative existence\n their nature is light and alyough they are inaccessible to the senses in a mysterious way they can be perceived or intuited as light\n i once heard a great yogi of india speaking of how it was possible to see the self as a blinding light that soothed rather than burned the eyes\n suppose a yousand suns should rise together into the sky such is the glory of the shape of infinite god\n bhagavad gita whose youghts are true\n actually the word is satyasankalpa which means a lot more than true youghts\n for after all god does not have youghts because he has no mind and the same is true of the self\n a being that knows does not need to think actually cannot think\n sankalpa means an act of will resolution or intention\n this is the nearest we can get to some idea of the movement of consciousness that takes place when god wills or determines something\n so we will have to leave it there\n whatever it may be in the consciousness of brahman the upanishad assures us that it is always sat absolutely true or real\n true in the sense that it is in total keeping with the nature of brahman real in the sense that is always results in something\n so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it\n isaiah who like the ether remains pure and unattached\n this divine self is said to be akashatma which shankara defines as one whose nature is like that of space all pervasive subtle and free from form\n just as the sky contains suns planets atmosphere clouds smoke and suchlike yet is utterly untouched and unaffected by them so the self is free from any effects from its continuous rebirths and their experiences\n the self has no karma or conditionings and so is like the ether at all times\n from whom proceed all works\n it is a fundamental tenet of the upanishads and the gita that the self never acts\n so when the upanishad uses the term sarvakarma all karma it is to be taken in the context of sankhya the philosophy behind them\n sankhya declares that all action takes place only through the proximity of the self\n that the energy bodies prakriti in which the self is encased are like the iron that is heated and expands through the nearness of fire or like the globes so popular at state fairs in which the little flags rotate because of light shining on them\n so all actions occur through the presence of the self but are not done by the self\n all movements of will or intention the higher nature of desire are made possible by the self by its transforming influence\n but as with action the self does not produce them\n all odors all tastes\n the same is true of the senses and the impressions they convey to the mind\n the self causes them to function and be perceived again not through actually making them happen but through simply being there\n the prime idea in these three phrases is that all life takes place through the self being present\n the self does not live in a relative sense but is the life giver in the ultimate sense\n this is but part of its wonder\n this underscores what has just been said\n it is the all pervasive presence of the self that causes all phenomena to occur\n who is beyond the senses\n this is said over and over in the scriptures but it is put here within the context of the realization of the self\n we must turn inward to find the self and in that turning we must get beyond the senses\n those who are finding god do not abound in visions chills levitations revelations surging of energies cataclysmic experiences sweepings of emotions and all such that are nothing but distractions that can never lead to reality\n all phenomena must be left far behind and we must walk in the sky that is free of all clouds we must expand into consciousness that is free from all types of experience and even existence in the relative sense\n for centuries people have amused themselves with mystical experiences and phenomena remaining ignorant and earthbound despite their psychic powers and aura of holiness\n we must seek for the one\n and to do that we must abandon the many\n in whom there is fullness of joy forever\n if we could only get this truth through our heads and into our hearts in god alone is the perfection of happiness love peace and all goodness and in nothing or nowhere else\n it is however not enough to momentarily touch or enter the joy of the self\n we must be established in it\n by that i mean we must totally enter into it encompass that consciousness and be encompassed by it\n when this is done our realization is permanent\n it will never be lost or diminished in any way\n in the bible this is spoken of as entering or possessing our inheritance\n he is my very self\n alyough we identify with so much from life to life this which the upanishads have so carefully described is our true self and that alone should be our identity\n this is made possible through the realization of the self not intellectually but as a state of eternal being\n dwelling within the lotus of my heart\n since the self is there in the depths of our being only that yogi whose joy is inward inward his peace and his vision inward shall come to brahman and know nirvana\n bhagavad gita the all encompassing self smaller than a grain of rice is the self smaller than a grain of barley smaller than a mustard seed smaller than a canary seed yea smaller even than the kernel of a canary seed\n yet again is that self within the lotus of my heart greater than the earth greater than the heavens yea greater than all the worlds\n the atman transcends time and space is always beyond them\n consequently the self cannot really be described as large or small\n it is beyond such dualities and beyond any attempt at measurement\n why then does the upanishad say what has just been cited it is indicating to us that there is nothing which is not pervaded by the self there is nothing so small or so large that it is outside of the self\n rather the self encompasses all relative being as well as the absolute\n however large or small something may be the self is present within it to the fullest degree\n the kernel of a canary seed is not a reference to bird seed but to the shyamaka seed that is extremely small and its kernel is infinitesimal\n the self encompasses all worlds all levels of creation\n in modern times we know that the physical universe is beyond all conception it is so vast\n even so the self is much greater\n but this is true only because it is part of the supreme self who spoke through krishna to arjuna saying but what need have you arjuna to know this huge variety know only that i exist and that one atom of myself sustains the universe\n bhagavad gita the self is within our heart and within that self is contained all the worlds\n so we carry infinity within ourselves\n no wonder the pinnacle of the spiritual quest is called self realization\n the great summing up now the upanishad wraps and sums it all up saying he from whom proceed all works all desires all odors all tastes who pervades all who is beyond the senses and in whom there is fullness of joy forever he the heart enshrined self is verily brahman\n i who worship the self within the lotus of my heart will attain him at death\n he who worships him and puts his trust in him shall surely attain him\n it is those who worship the self by constantly being intent on the self through the inward focusing of their japa and meditation of om that will shed all false identities and enter into the truth of the self if not in this life then at the time of leaving the body and ascending into higher consciousness\n even the upanishads recognize the value of citing spiritual authorities for the second half of this verse says said the seer sandilya at the moment of death a knower of brahman should meditate on the following truths thou art imperishable\n thou art the changeless reality\n thou art the source of life\n this is possible for those who have made self knowledge the central and paramount factor of their life s work\n those who have come to know the self through profound meditation and constant remembrance of om will then know that they are imperishable changeless and life itself\n krishna then a most interesting statement is made this highest knowledge the knowledge of brahman having drunk of which one never thirsts did ghora angirasa teach to krishna the son of devaki\n by this we know that krishna himself is the embodiment of the upanishadic wisdom and was therefore qualified to give the teachings of the bhagavad gita which has been called the cream and the essence of the upanishads\n satyakama now we come to a very interesting part of the chandogya upanishad which consists of stories of seekers who came to know brahman\n a feature that will seem odd to western readers is the instruction of some of the seekers by animals and even by the forces of nature\n any explanation i might give is purely speculative and not worth much but here they are \n the accounts are simply symbolic parables the animals and nature forces symbolizing powers within the yogis\n these are not actual events but dreams which the yogis had this too is a matter of symbolism\n they are intuitions occurring to the yogis as they pondered the animals and the natural forces wanting to understand the ideas behind them for the universe is entirely ideational in nature\n i do not think that any of these are very sait isfactory so i prefer to just focus on the spiritual teaching and let the rest go by the way we crack the shell and throw it away keeping the nut inside which is nourishing\n one thing is evident yough the pure hearted will be instructed by other means if human teachers fail to do so or even be available \n truthfulness satya a foundation of yoga is taught here in the story of satyakama\n a case of identity one day the boy satyakama came to his mother and said mother i want to be a religious student brahmaachari \n what is my family name gotra my son replied his mother i do not know\n in my youth i was a servant and worked in many places\n i do not know who was your father\n i am jabala and you are satyakama\n call yourself satyakama jabala\n chandogya upanishad this is no small thing\n at the time of satyakama it was essential for the teacher acharya to know the caste of the student for the instruction given was according to the student s caste so as to prepare him for his distinctive life within the society of that era\n in this way children were prepared to live the life of brahmin priests and teachers kshatriya administrators and warriors and vaishya arit isans and merchants\n shudras servants were not accepted in the schools since education was deemed pointless for their mode of life\n it is true that in very ancient times a student s caste was finally determined during his education according to his aptitudes and inclinations but he started out being considered of the caste of his parents\n later caste was solely a matter of heredity\n whichever era this story took place in the father s caste had to be known\n complicating the whole thing was the matter of gotra\n gotra means clan family or lineage and all the castes were divided in gotras\n this too could determine what the student would be taught because different gotras had their own dharma shastras scriptures which set forth the social and religious rules for members of that gotra\n sometimes these texts governed such minutiae as the student s style of hair mode and color of clothing and even the type of wood their staff should be made of and how long it should be\n those born completely outside such a system may consider this all meaningless complications but it was not so at the time the upanishad was written and we should realize the seriousness of all this even if we do not feel the same way\n anyhow satyakama needed to know his caste and his gotra\n since his mother was a servant a shudra he should not be accepted anyway and on top of it he was illegitimate a total bar to assimilation by society on any level including education\n but satyakama thirsted for knowledge and with the singleminded intent of a child dared to approach the great sage gautama something even those of highest caste might hesitate to do\n truth thereupon the boy went to gautama and asked to be accepted as a student\n of what family are you my lad inquired the sage\n satyakama replied i asked my mother what my family name was and she answered i do not know\n in my youth i was a servant and worked in many places\n i do not know who was your father\n i am jabala and you are satyakama\n call yourself satyakama jabala i am therefore satyakama jabala sir\n then said the sage none but a true brahmin would have spoken thus\n go and fetch fuel for i will teach you\n you have not swerved from the truth\n here we see that character composed of karma and samskara was the basis for caste in the upanishadic age\n truthfulness is a prime trait of a brahmin as is indicated here\n though prabhavananda translates none but a true brahmin would have spoken thus the literal meaning is a non brahmin will not be able to say this\n this is extremely powerful for it not only indicates that a true brahmin is in such a purified state that it is impossible for him to not speak the truth and speak it fully it also indicates that a brahmin will not have the egoity that would prevent him speaking truthfully and plainly regarding himself in all aspects of his life\n for him there is no ego based shyness or embarrassment of any sort\n a brahmin will never seek to hide anything about himself by speech or silence\n as yogis we must seek to be perfect brahmins\n the realization now i will summarize what is a rather wordy and sometimes obscure text\n you can read it yourself in to and you will see what i mean\n satyakama at the instruction of his guru gautama lived some years in the forest\n during that time from various sources he learned in stages that the entire cosmos is a manifestation of brahman yough only a particle of brahman\n even yough i say he learned this it was not learning in the ordinary intellectual sense\n rather it was direct experience gained in the depths of meditation\n thus satyakama knew brahman and knew brahman was manifesting as all the worlds and at the same time transcending them all\n the return at last the youth arrived at the home of his master and reverently presented himself before him\n as soon as gautama saw him he exclaimed my son your face shines like a knower of brahman\n by whom were you taught by beings other than men replied satyakama but i desire that you too should teach me\n for i have heard from the wise that the knowledge that the teacher imparts will alone lead to the supreme good\n then the sage taught him that knowledge and left nothing out\n this reminds us of the radiant buddha walking down the road after his enlightenment\n like gautama a brahmin met him and also saw the divine radiance and asked him who are you continuing to walk on buddha simply said i am awake\n alyough he possessed the perfect knowledge of brahman brahmajnana satyakama wisely asked that gautama should teach him\n for he knew that his perceptions might be either incorrect or incomplete and he wanted to check them by hearing from the lips of an enlightened master\n this is the way of the wise they are always aware that they may not have perfect knowledge or experience\n it is only the ignorant that insist they know the truth and have no need of testing\n as dion fortune remarked in one of her books those who are deluded will hysterically insist on the veracity of their revelations even being violent verbally and physically in defense of those delusions\n on the other hand a person who has had valid experiences and garnered true wisdom from them will speak of such things very apologetically even hesitantly frequently commenting that they realize their experiences may be delusions or they may be mistaken in their understanding of them even if they are real\n because of his sobriety and humility satyakama was woryour and capable of being instructed fully in the wisdom of the sages rishis \n and so he was\n such is an ideal spiritual aspirant\n upakosala now we come to the story of another student upakosala dwelt as a student in the house of satyakama for twelve years\n though the teacher let other disciples return to their homes after they had been duly taught the way of truth upakosala was not allowed to depart\n the wife of satyakama entreated her husband to finish teaching him in order that he might go home like the rest but satyakama not only refused to do so but went off on a journey\n at this upakosala was so sad and sick at heart that he could not eat\n the teacher s wife plied him with food and in everything treated him with tender affection but to no avail\n at last the boy cried out to her o mother my heart is still so impure i am too unhappy to eat the mind of upakosala satyakama did not let upakosala return home because he had not learned all that was necessary for leading a fully dharmic life according to the scriptural precepts\n it is interesting that upakosala does not consider that his failing is an academic one but rather one of interior disposition\n this shows his fundamental woryoursss\n my heart is still so impure is a misleading translation\n the text actually says in this person there are these many desires which tend towards many things i am filled with them\n he spoke in the third person because he was objective in analyzing himself\n this indicates his lack of egoit ism\n this reminds us of the following from the life of jesus he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house\n and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word\n but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost you not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me\n and jesus answered and said unto her martha martha you art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her\n luke upakosala understood this and jesus must have studied this upanishad in india realizing that alyough desires may not be negative or foolish yet they pull us in many directions whirling us around and confusing our minds and depleting our life energies\n only when the mind is fixed on the one can the many be safely attended to\n why why did the sage leave this boy to his sorrow those who see with earthly eyes and think only earthly youghts often accuse the saints of being heartless or even cruel\n but they know what they are doing and are aware that their actions are needed\n when jesus told his disciples that he would be leaving them they were unhappy\n so he said because i have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart\n nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you\n john vivekananda once commented a man harms his disciples by staying too long with them for they do not develop the independence needed to pursue spiritual life\n swami sivananda often sent his disciples away to engage in spiritual practice or spiritual work\n even at the time of his leaving this world few old disciples were present\n there was a man who very much wanted spiritual instruction from one of sri ramakrishna s disciples but that man sent him to another disciple who sent him to still another and that one refused him too\n becoming very upset even angry and bitter the man left calcutta and returned home\n that very night he awoke feeling that someone was in his room\n indeed there was sri ramakrishna himself in living physical form he touched the man blessing him and gave him spiritual instruction\n the next time that man saw one of his refusers he was told we knew you were destined to receive personal instruction from thakur himself that is why we did not teach you ourselves\n the teaching and so it was with upakosala\n through a voice from the sacred fire brahman became his teacher\n here is how then a voice from out the fire which he was tending said this life is brahman\n the sky is brahman\n know you brahman i know that life is brahman replied upakosala\n but that the sky is brahman or that bliss is brahman i do not know\n again came the voice from out the fire this time explaining that by sky was meant the lotus of the heart wherein dwells brahman and that by bliss was meant the bliss of brahman\n both said the voice refer to brahman and continuing it taught upakosala thus earth food fire sun all these that you worship are forms of brahman\n he who is seen in the sun that one am i\n he who dwells in the east in the north in the west and in the south he who dwells in the moon in the stars and in water that one am i\n he who dwells in the sky and makes the lightning his home that one also am i\n know well the true nature of the world that it may never do you harm\n thereupon the fire which had been only an earthly fire with which to prepare sacrifices assumed a new aspect and became the lord himself\n the earth was transformed life was transformed the sun the moon the stars the lightning everything was transformed and deified\n and thus it was that to upakosala the true nature of all things was revealed\n this is thoroughly clear and needs no comment except to say that here we see the nature of enlightenment as a total transformation of perception\n and that is one of the greatest teachings of this upanishad\n the final words in due time satyakama returned home\n when he saw upakosala he said my son your face shines like one who knows brahman\n who has taught you beings other than men replied upakosala\n then said satyakama my son what you have learned is true\n true also is this that i teach you now\n lo to him who knows it shall no evil cling even as drops of water cling not to the leaf of the lotus he who glows in the depths of your eyes that is brahman that is the self of yourself\n he is the beautiful one he is the luminous one\n in all the worlds forever and ever he shines nothing more can or need be said\n svetaketu now we come to the best known and most valued section of the upanishads the story of svetaketu and his learning about brahman and also his own self\n prabhavananda has wisely condensed the narrative as it contains a great deal of repetition which at one time in india was considered high literary style as the pali sutras of buddhism show \n learning that was ignorance when svetaketu was twelve years old his father uddalaka said to him svetaketu you must now go to school and study\n none of our family my child is ignorant of brahman\n what a blessed time it must have been when education was aimed at the attainment of brahmajnana thereupon svetaketu went to a teacher and studied for twelve years\n after committing to memory all the vedas he returned home full of pride in his learning\n chandogya upanishad yes yes yes we all have read over and over that the vedas are the basis of sanatana dharma and that belief in the vedas makes one a hindu\n but this is not the perspective of the upanishads or the bhagavad gita\n vedic study is constantly being decried by them as worthless so what does that say about the vedas which by the way are said to be three not four\n just calling them shabda brahman the sound brahman does not make them so\n anyhow anyone who reads the upanishads and gita knows that om is the shabda brahman in the same way in the bible we find the prophets including david in the psalms denouncing the ways of the law and deriding those who follow it\n the essenes declared that the law the torah had been corrupted and brought into line with the ways of the ignorant religions of the nations which surrounded and intimidated israel\n however we may look at the question there is no doubt that twelve years of vedic study had left svetaketu both ignorant and arrogant\n his father noticing the young man s conceit said to him svetaketu have you asked for that knowledge by which we hear the unhearable by which we perceive the unperceivable by which we know the unknowable what is that knowledge sir asked svetaketu\n chandogya upanishad here we have three words ashrutam amatam and avijnatam that are most important\n ashrutam means the unheard amatam means the unyought or the unconceived and avijnatam means the unknown\n they also mean the unhearable the unthinkable and the unknowable\n these are epithets of brahman the absolute being\n not only do we not at this moment hear think of or know brahman we cannot do so not through the mind that is\n but we can know brahman directly at the core of our self\n when we go beyond the usual perceptors into the knower then we will hear wiyout hearing think wiyout yought and know wiyout knowing\n for it it will be a matter of being alone\n in other words we must be yogis\n the knowledge uddalaka now tells svetaketu my child as by knowing one lump of clay all things made of clay are known the difference being only in name and arising from speech and the truth being that all are clay as by knowing a nugget of gold all things made of gold are known the difference being only in name and arising from speech and the truth being that all are gold exactly so is that knowledge knowing which we know all\n this is pretty straightforward but it has an interesting implication\n uddalaka says that if we know one lump of clay or one nugget of gold we will know all clay and gold\n the self atman and brahman are absolutely one yet the self is limited in its scope whereas brahman is limitless and willing to share that limitlessness with us\n therefore the way to know the paramatman brahman is to know the jivatman the individual self\n once we know the part we know the whole\n there is more to it than this because in that knowing we participate in the infinite being of brahman\n this is a matter of yoga and beyond the scope of language to express or explain\n that is why the kena upanishad says he truly knows brahman who knows him as beyond knowledge he who thinks that he knows knows not\n the ignorant think that brahman is known but the wise know him to be beyond knowledge\n kena upanishad in response svetaketu says but surely those venerable teachers of mine are ignorant of this knowledge for if they had possessed it they would have taught it to me\n do you therefore sir give me that knowledge\n be it so said uddalaka\n the one in the beginning there was existence one only wiyout a second\n some say that in the beginning there was nonexistence only and that out of that the universe was born\n but how could such a thing be how could existence be born of non existence no my son in the beginning there was existence alone one only wiyout a second\n chandogya upanishad in the beginning and evermore there was sat existence reality being brahman the absolute pure being\n and this sat was ekam evam adwityam one only wiyout a second\n this absolute unity is all that ever has been or that can ever be\n this is a major principle of sanatana dharma one that is not easy to always keep in mind since we find ourselves immersed in the experience of duality\n but when through self purification and the practice of yoga we sweep aside this delusive curtain we will see the one and know it within our own self atman as its inmost essence\n the sat is always one not one among many and is absolutely indivisible\n duality cannot arise in it to any degree\n this being so uddalaka warns svetaketu away from the mistaken idea that there was an original nothing from which came something\n certainly brahman is no thing but that is a far cry from nothing\n rather it is everything\n this is important to us for two reasons\n first if originally there was nothing then when we return to our primal state we will be annihilated become nothing\n and indeed there are those who believe and even yearn for this\n but it is not so\n second for us raised in western religion it points out the absurdity of the theological principle that god created the world ex nihil from nothing\n since this second proposition is merely an intellectual perception it is not particularly negative but the first one is for it deludes us as to what our ultimate state is meant to be\n and it is perfectly possible to enter into an empty jada state of unconscious inertia that can be mistaken for nirvana that is often wrongly translated annihilation or extinguishment\n the many he the one yought to himself let me be many let me grow forth\n thus out of himself he projected the universe and having projected out of himself the universe he entered into every being\n all that is has its self in him alone\n of all things he is the subtle essence\n he is the truth\n he is the self\n and that svetaketu that art thou\n please sir tell me more about this self\n be it so my child\n this is extremely important\n brahman did not create anything it projected everything out of its own being and not as a separate entity for it is within every thing as its sole reality as its self as its subtle essence\n you might be interested to know that this was the original teaching of christianity\n in the new testament the word translated made in speaking of the origin of the universe is ginomai which means to be generated not made from nothing\n it also means to arise or be assembled from something already existing\n the expression only begotten is monogenis coming from the same root word\n in the apostolic constitutions one of the earliest liturgical texts of christianity god is said to have brought forth all things as from a treasure house not from nothing\n after saying all these amazing things uddalaka enunciates the highest wonder tat twam asi thou art that\n this is the pinnacle of the upanishads of all the wisdom scriptures of india\n this awesome truth that behind and beneath it all including our own self is that is brahman\n of all things he is the subtle essence\n he is the truth\n he is the self\n svetaketu asked to hear more\n in a sense there was no more but there could be more affirmations of the single truth\n so the unknowing as the bees make honey by gathering juices from many flowering plants and trees and as these juices reduced to one honey do not know from what flowers they severally come similarly my son all creatures when they are merged in that one existence whether in dreamless sleep or in death know nothing of their past or present state because of the ignorance enveloping them know not that they are merged in him and that from him they came\n whatever these creatures are whether a lion or a tiger or a boar or a worm or a gnat or a mosquito that they remain after they come back from dreamless sleep\n all these have their self in him alone\n he is the truth\n he is the subtle essence of all\n he is the self\n and that svetaketu that art thou\n please sir tell me more about this self\n be it so my son\n chandogya upanishad all of us in relative existence are enveloped in ignorance\n that should not be hard to accept but whatever the background or past of any sentient being of whatever level in dreamless sleep and death they all return to brahman\n but their enveloping ignorance prevents them from knowing where they are the way a submarine keeps those inside from being wet\n so they are not enlightened in any way yough so close to the light from whence they came\n alyough in that state they have no self concept no identity with their present level of evolution when they awake from sleep or return from death to rebirth they find themselves in the form that corresponds to their inner development\n and of course they immediately get lost in the dream and start wandering around never really coming to rest anywhere\n yet at all times they are within brahman and are brahman\n svetaketu wants more so his father repeats what he has said from another angle\n the rivers in the east flow eastward the rivers in the west flow westward and all enter into the sea\n from sea to sea they pass the clouds lifting them to the sky as vapor and sending them down as rain\n and as these rivers when they are united with the sea do not know whether they are this or that river likewise all those creatures that i have named when they have come back from brahman know not whence they came\n all those beings have their self in him alone\n he is the truth\n he is the subtle essence of all\n he is the self\n and that svetaketu that art thou\n please sir tell me more about this self\n be it so my child\n svetaketu asks for more\n the all pervading source if someone were to strike once at the root of this large tree it would bleed but live\n if he were to strike at its stem it would bleed but live\n if he were to strike at the top it would bleed but live\n pervaded by the living self this tree stands firm and takes its food but if the self were to depart from one of its branches that branch would wither if it were to depart from a second that would wither if it were to depart from a third that would wither\n if it were to depart from the whole tree the whole tree would wither\n likewise my son know this the body dies when the self leaves it but the self dies not\n all that is has its self in him alone\n he is the truth\n he is the subtle essence of all\n he is the self\n and that svetaketu that art thou\n please sir tell me more about this self\n everything is alive but only because the living self brahman inhabits it\n if that presence is withdrawn then death results\n therefore when the self leaves the body the body dies but not the self\n yet see how backwards we are in the west\n we think that it is being in the body that makes a person alive that when they leave the body they die\n absolutely backwards not only that we continue to treat the body as the person dressing it up putting makeup on it fixing its hair and putting in in a satin lined box and mourning over it\n even crazier we will first have drained out its blood and pumped formaldehyde into it\n then we put the box in a concrete box in a grave and pile dirt on top of it heap flowers on it and leave\n but we keep coming back to visit the dead with more flowers and even talk to the body as yough it were the still living person who has long ago departed from the body\n now if that is not insane tell me what is and it is not only sanctioned by our stupid religions it is encouraged by them especially those that disdain prayers for the departed\n more says svetaketu\n the subtle essence bring a fruit of that nyagrodha banyan tree\n here it is sir\n it is broken sir\n what do you see some seeds extremely small sir\n break one of them\n it is broken sir\n what do you see nothing sir\n the subtle essence you do not see and in that is the whole of the nyagrodha tree\n believe my son that that which is the subtle essence in that have all things their existence\n that is the truth\n that is the self\n and that svetaketu that art thou\n please sir tell me more about this self\n this is easily understood\n what i would like to point out is the fact that uddalaka says the whole of the nyagrodha tree is in the divine essence\n it is not part in and part out as we think in the west believing that part of us is material and part is spirit or that part of us lives in this world and part of us in the spiritual world\n these distinctions are products of ignorance\n there is only the one\n in response to svetaketu s request uddalaka produces another object lesson\n put this salt in water and come to me tomorrow morning\n svetaketu did as he was bidden\n the next morning his father asked him to bring the salt which he had put in the water\n but he could not for it had dissolved\n then said uddalaka sip the water and tell me how it tastes\n it is salty sir\n in the same way continued uddalaka yough you do not see brahman in this body he is indeed here\n that which is the subtle essence in that have all things their existence\n that is the truth\n that is the self\n and that svetaketu that art thou\n please sir tell me more about this self said the youth again\n be it so my child\n for some reason prabhavananda did not translate this fully\n in the original text uddalaka asks svetaketu to taste the water from the top the middle and the bottom of the bowl\n each time he finds it salty\n the idea is that brahman pervades the entire field of relative existence as that field\n and we are that\n svetaketu wants to hear more\n teaching needed as a man may be blindfolded and led away and left in a strange place and as having been so dealt with he turns in every direction and cries out for someone to remove his bandages and show him the way home and as one thus entreated may loose his bandages and give him comfort and as thereupon he walks from village to village asking his way as he goes and as he arrives home at last just so does a man who meets with an illumined teacher obtain true knowledge\n that which is the subtle essence in that have all beings their existence\n that is the truth\n that is the self\n and that o svetaketu that art thou\n please sir tell me more about this self\n be it so my child\n the teaching here is of major import\n we can know we are blind and lost and need to see and go back home but it stops there\n we have to be made to see and shown the way\n this can only happen when we find the teachings of enlightened masters\n if we can meet such a master face to face our good fortune is incalculable\n over forty years have passed since i received the blessing and wisdom of the first masters of my acquaintance and some decades since the last one spoke with me\n yet those memories are my heart s rosary which i can go over and vividly return in memory to those days\n i do not have to believe books i have seen living embodiments of sanatana dharma and listened to their words many of them addressed personally to me\n however i have spent many many more hours reading the printed teachings of some of those great masters and many more masters that i have only met in books\n however the teachings come to us it is the application that matters\n i saw a lot of do nothings circulating around the masters who just played groupie until the master died and then they wasted their time grieving over the loss of something they never really had and waiting for the master to give the green light a quote from one of them so they could die and go to the master s loka and be with him forever\n small chance they were not really with the master in life so why in death what i want to assure you is that truth is always truth\n if you learn mathematics from a teacher or a book it is the same\n further this upanishadic simile does not inculcate the guru disciple enslavement that is considered so essential for enlightenment\n yes one person did take away the bandage and point out the way but notice that thereupon he walks from village to village asking his way as he goes\n so he has many teachers not just one\n and it should be the same with us\n loyalty to a single teacher should not be a blindfold on the eyes of our soul\n all masters are living and as yogananda said we should realize that all masters are one and not make differences between them\n he is speaking of masters yough not just teachers\n ultimately even the teachers are just the mouthpieces of brahman of our own ultimate self\n at his request svetaketu now receives one last instruction\n forgetting and remembering when a man is fatally ill his relations gather round him and ask do you know me do you know me now until his speech is merged in his mind his mind in his breath his breath in his vital heat his vital heat in the supreme being he knows them\n but when his speech is merged in his mind his mind in his breath his breath in his vital heat his vital heat in the supreme being then he does not know them\n that which is the subtle essence in that have all beings their existence\n that is the truth\n that is the self\n and that o svetaketu that art thou\n when we merge with brahman in mahasamadhi the great exit of death then all that we knew and believed in is nothing to us only brahman remains for us to know and identify with\n the long journey is over reality gained at last\n all that was enslaving and misery producing all the trivia and folly of relativity is over forever\n no return engagement no return trip ticket home at last home forever\n home in infinity life to a degree undreamed of by us for ages beyond calculation\n for the final time we close our external eyes to open the eye of spirit\n my grandmother asked me to have a song entitled we ll say goodnight here but good morning up there sung at her funeral\n it certainly is night here and eternal morning in god\n but attaining it is not so simple as the song implies\n nevertheless one day beyond all time it will happen to us all\n then we will really know that which is the subtle essence in that have all beings their existence\n that is the truth\n that is the self\n and that art thou\n the essence of the mind and prana sometimes the longer upanishads branch off from the central subject and explore a byway or two\n this happened in the preceding dialogue between uddalaka and svetaketu\n uddalaka began expounding the origin of various components of the human being including the mind the manas which is the sensory mind the field of energy which conveys the impressions of the sensory impulses of the brain\n it is part of our astral bodies but since it consists of the grossest of astral substance it is integrated even interlaced with the material body and brain\n according to uddalaka the energy of the mind is derived from the physical body\n here are his words food when eaten becomes divided into three parts\n what is its grossest ingredient that becomes feces what is the middling ingredient that becomes flesh and what is the subtlest ingredient that becomes mind\n from this we see how important diet is for the very substance of the mind is the essential energy of the food we eat\n for that reason we must be careful both as to what we eat and what its vibration might be\n for example we should avoid meat fish eggs alcohol nicotine and mind influencing drugs that should be obvious to the yogi\n but we must also be careful about the vibration of acceptable food for if it is a vehicle of negative vibrations it will be poisonous to the mind\n when food is cooked or handled the vibrations of the cook and the handler enter into it for cooked food is very receptive to vibrations\n usually a prayer or blessing will neutralize any negative energies attached to food but not always especially if the cook or handler were mentally disturbed\n restaurant food can be a problem for that reason and also because the food may be cooked in the same oil in which meat has been cooked or may have been touched by meat in some way in the restaurant kitchen\n prana the subtle life force in the yogi s body must also be kept pure as it affects everything in the physical and astral bodies and has a major influence on meditation during which the pranas must be as pure and subtle as possible since the mental energies and the prana interact with one another intimately\n about the prana uddalaka says water when drunk becomes divided into three parts\n what is its grossest ingredient that becomes urine what is the middling ingredient that becomes blood and what is the subtlest ingredient that becomes prana\n what is said about water stands for any liquid and we must be as careful about that as about our food\n hence mind is made up of food prana is made up of water\n then he repeats this giving examples\n of the curd yogurt that is being churned that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and that becomes butter\n so also of the food that is eaten that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and that becomes the mind\n of the water that is drunk that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and that becomes prana\n hence mind is made up of food prana is made up of water\n this is extremely valuable knowledge for everyone but especially for the yogi as we see that food and drink have a direct effect on the mind and vital force within\n narada now we come to the account of the great sage narada and his inquiries made to the great master sanatkumara\n this contains a lot of rhetoric and repetition so i will omit some of the first fifteen sections of the seventh chapter of the chandogya upanishad as translated by swami prabhavananda\n the ladder to reality narada once came to sanatkumara and asked to be taught\n to sanatkumara s question what have you already studied narada replied that he had studied all the branches of learning art science music and philosophy as well as the sacred scriptures\n but said he i have gained no peace\n i have studied all this but the self i do not know\n i have heard from great teachers like you that he who knows the self overcomes grief\n grief is ever my lot\n help me i pray you to overcome it\n this contains a cardinal truth there is no peace or real happiness outside the knowledge of the self atma jnana \n those who wish to end all sorrow must seek that knowledge\n such is the assertion of the great teachers of humanity\n first sanatkumara taught narada the ascending steps of reality which we must perfect before we can know the ultimate reality that which we hear from others the faculty of speech the mind will intelligence meditation and the wisdom gained from direct spiritual experience\n the eternal truth then said sanatkumara but verily he is the true knower who knows eternal truth\n revered sir i wish to be a true knower\n then ask to know of that infinite reality\n sir i ask to know of it\n there are two simple points here\n the first is that only the knower of brahman really knows anything\n only those that know eternal being are jnanis knowers\n this is a necessary perspective for those that set out to seek the absolute for unless they hold to this outlook they may become distracted along the way and settle for less or even begin actively seeking the less\n the second point is that the seeker must ask a qualified teacher for teaching that it will not just be dropped in his hands\n asking is the heart of seeking\n an equally important point is implied here a qualified teacher will not teach unless asked\n somewhere i have mentioned that this was one of my first lessons learned during my first trip to india\n i found that fools and fakes went into teaching mode the moment they saw me and being grinding out the philosophical cliches along with the hints that i should arrange a world tour for them to end in america the land of opportunity\n since nineteenthcentury translations of the upanishads had the teacher addressing the disciple as my dear these ignoramuses and charlatans always called me my dear upon meeting me\n in contrast the real teachers and masters were kind and most polite asking me about my purpose in coming to india and where i had been and suchlike\n but they never said a word about either philosophy or yoga\n if i asked them for wisdom upon our first meeting they spoke sparingly in an almost diffident way in no way pushing their words at me or trying to impose their views on me\n some would not even answer the first time they were questioned\n one teacher only told me anything after i had inquired three times in a row\n after more contact they would become very free with me and answer my questions gladly\n but still they never volunteered anything\n i always had to ask\n this is the mark of a genuine teacher\n so narada had to declare his desire to know infinite reality\n steps on the path next swami prabhavananda gives a kind of digest of several verses\n it is only when a man has realized eternal truth that he declares it\n he who reflects upon it realizes it\n wiyout reflection it is not realized\n and only he who has faith and reverence reflects on eternal truth\n and only he who attends on a teacher gains faith and reverence\n and only he attends on a teacher who struggles to achieve self control\n and only he struggles to achieve selfcontrol who finds joy in it\n ask to know of this joy\n sir i ask to know of it\n chandogya this list starts at the top and goes to the bottom and are the steps to realization according to sri sanatkumara\n it is only when a man has realized eternal truth that he declares it\n only one who has realized the eternal truth of the brahman self can truly declare it\n all others just speak rumor and speculation\n so if we want spiritual authority we will have to seek out those that have found truth and embody it\n for their very words will convey awakening and empowerment to the woryour hearer\n that is why jesus made the remarkable statement the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life\n john this is not true of the words of ordinary teachers\n he who reflects upon it realizes it\n wiyout reflection it is not realized\n this does not mean mere intellectual yought just pondering on ideas about brahman\n the word matih means thinking of something reflecting upon it because of love of great affinity for it\n shankara says this in his commentary\n the meaning is that the woryour seeker is purified enough in intellect to intuit both brahman and his eternal relation with brahman\n as a result a spontaneous inner recognition of brahman arises along with a reaching out for the experience of brahman as reality\n just as a magnet draws metal to itself so the yogi begins to experience the pull of the infinite and loves the drawing and the possibility of the final union\n brahman becomes the most cherished object of his heart and its reality is never absent from his consciousness\n this is a sign of his nearness to realizing brahman\n and only he who has faith and reverence reflects on eternal truth\n the woryour yogi is not a casual weekender paddling his feet in the ocean of infinity\n rather he is one in whom intuitive conviction of the reality of god and the necessity of finding god has arisen\n this insight motivates him from the depths of his own being\n and only he who attends on a teacher gains faith and reverence\n actually the text says nothing about a teacher just the word nishtha which means steadiness\n but shankara in his commentary says that it indicates the steadfast seeking of a teacher s wisdom for acquiring knowledge of brahman\n so prabhavananda has translated accordingly\n we have already considered that we may have recourse either to a living teacher or the teachings of a realized master\n it is contact with the vibrations of a teacher that enable faith to arise in us\n sometimes only the sight of a master is needed for awakening to begin even seeing a picture or photograph\n something is stirred deep within often impressions from a previous life\n wonderful as that may be it is steadfastness in inwardly and outwardly approaching the teacher that is needed for success in our search\n and only he attends on a teacher who struggles to achieve self control\n for disciple means one who is engaging in discipline\n things do not come automatically or easily to the seeker\n that must be faced\n and paths that pretend to automatically and easily produce realization are fake\n discipline willing discipline is an absolute requisite for spiritual attainment\n otherwise any effort expended is most likely to be useless\n a lot of culit ish seekers labor and slave and deprive and torment themselves and end up getting nowhere\n but they are not truly disciplined in the sense of intelligent understanding and effort put forth in the context of a viable tradition\n and only he struggles to achieve self control who finds joy in it\n this is a signal trait of the woryour seeker he find joy in the seeking and rejoices in having at last found the way to real finding\n the way is one of discipline and purification and he loves every bit of it however it may pain the ego for he knows it leads to the end of uncertainty and suffering\n such a seeker does not sigh and grudgingly do what is necessary feeling put upon all the way\n that kind will not persevere and good riddance\n no he is like the men jesus told about the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field\n again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it\n matthew they gladly gave all they had\n such are those who find joy in the struggle for self mastery and selfrealization\n saint paul says that jesus himself for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god\n hebrews ask to know of this joy\n sir i ask to know of it\n certainly many people seek higher reality as a result of disillusionment and suffering\n some merely seek the cessation of suffering but the wiser actively seek the joy that is the nature of brahman\n the source of joy the infinite is the source of joy\n there is no joy in the finite\n only in the infinite is there joy\n ask to know of the infinite\n sir i ask to know of it\n this is not an easy lesson to learn that there is no joy outside of the infinite brahman there is no joy outside of our own self\n the meditator knows how difficult this his for the mind keeps running after utter trivia in meditation turning from the way to ananda and thinking of those things that only bring suffering even yough the mind delights in the idea of them\n fool s gold is preferred by the mind to real gold\n this is an addiction incredibly hard to be cured\n the first step is asking about the infinite as this verse shows\n experiencing the infinite what now follows is not a definition of the infinite because that is impossible since it is beyond conceptualization and therefore beyond words\n but it is possible to give a hint about the experience of the infinite even yough it will be more of a neti neti not this not that approach\n where one sees nothing but the one hears nothing but the one knows nothing but the one there is the infinite\n where one sees another hears another knows another there is the finite\n the infinite is immortal the finite is mortal\n in what does the infinite rest in its own glory nay not even in that\n in the world it is said that cows and horses elephants and gold slaves wives fields and houses are man s glory but these are poor and finite things\n how shall the infinite rest anywhere but in itself i know i have said it elsewhere but i must say it here nowhere in the entire world can there be found teachings equal to those of the upanishads\n and these two verses are proof of that\n where one sees another hears another knows another there is the finite can be understood in two ways both of which are correct\n first if someone sees anything besides the infinite then he is not perceiving the infinite for when the infinite is perceived all else either disappears or is seen as the infinite itself\n second if anyone sees anything other than his self which is one with the infinite he is not seeing the infinite\n how shall the infinite rest anywhere but in itself this is also true of those who have realized the infinite\n where is the infinite the infinite is below above behind before to the right to the left\n i am all this\n this infinite is the self\n the self is below above behind before to the right to the left\n i am all this\n one who knows meditates upon and realizes the truth of the self such an one delights in the self revels in the self rejoices in the self\n he becomes master of himself and master of all the worlds\n slaves are they who know not this truth\n the knower of the infinite he who knows meditates upon and realizes this truth of the self finds that everything primal energy ether fire water and all other elements mind will speech sacred hymns and scriptures indeed the whole universe issues forth from it\n it is written he who has realized eternal truth does not see death nor illness nor pain he sees everything as the self and obtains all\n the self is one and it has become all things\n when the senses are purified the heart is purified when the heart is purified there is constant and unceasing remembrance of the self when there is constant and unceasing remembrance of the self all bonds are loosed and freedom is attained\n thus the venerable sanatkumara taught narada who was pure in heart how to pass from darkness into light\n chandogya upanishad nothing really needs to be said in commentary\n what is needed is the resolve to follow the example of narada and attain the same realization\n within the lotus of the heart the chidakasha within within the city of brahman which is the body there is the heart and within the heart there is a little house\n this house has the shape of a lotus and within it dwells that which is to be sought after inquired about and realized\n what then is that which dwelling within this little house this lotus of the heart is to be sought after inquired about and realized chandogya upanishad the body is the abode of brahman and the self\n the core center of each relative sentient being is its heart\n and within the heart is a dahara a dwelling and within that dwelling is pure akasha ether or space\n but it is not the akasha that is one of the five primal elements panchabhuta but rather the chidakasha the space of consciousness\n in other words the inmost dweller of the heart is brahman itself\n such is the import of these verses according to shankara\n so it is brahman which is to be sought after inquired about and realized\n the inner cosmos as large as the universe outside even so large is the universe within the lotus of the heart\n within it are heaven and earth the sun the moon the lightning and all the stars\n what is in the macrocosm is in this microcosm\n how is this possible because space like time is only a idea only an experience not a reality\n infinity is within each one of us\n i have had various experiences of this fact but here is an account i wrote down some years ago\n while meditating one day all ordinary physical sensation vanished\n spatial relation ceased to exist and i found myself keenly aware of being beyond dimension neither large nor small but infinite for infinity is beyond size \n alyough the terminology is inappropriate to such a state to make it somewhat understandable i have to say that i perceived an infinity of worlds within me\n suns some solo and others surrounded by planets glimmered inside my spaceless space\n not that i saw the light but i felt or intuited it\n actually i did not see anything and yet i did\n it is not expressible in terms of ordinary sense experience yet i must use those terms\n i experienced myself as everything that existed within the relative material universe\n i was experiencing the mirror image of the cosmos that exists within the chidakasha in the heart\n no one had ever told me about this so at first i was at a loss to figure it out\n but then in a moment the truth flashed into my mind\n when much later i read these words of the chandogya upanishad i realized how amazing and invaluable is yoga\n the yogi can realize for himself the things written in the wisdom texts of india\n he can both experience and understand the meaning of the experience and all from within\n and yet all things that exist all beings and all desires are in the city of brahman what then becomes of them when old age approaches and the body dissolves in death though old age comes to the body the lotus of the heart does not grow old\n at death of the body it does not die\n the lotus of the heart where brahman exists in all his glory that and not the body is the true city of brahman\n brahman dwelling therein is untouched by any deed ageless deathless free from grief free from hunger and from thirst\n his desires are right desires and his desires are fulfilled\n the mystic angelus silesius wrote that if he could die then god would die that if he could cease to exist god would cease to exist\n such was his absolute understanding of the identity of the self and god\n since this is so the upanishad tells us that the immortal is within us whatever the condition of the body\n moreover the desires of that self are satyakama true desires and its will is satyasankalpa true will\n so if we will center our consciousness in the self we will not have worry about desire or will they will be sat revealers of the real\n true desire and will having spoken of true desire and true will as properties of the self the upanishad now outlines the practical aspect of such\n as here on earth all the wealth that one earns is but transitory so likewise transitory are the heavenly enjoyments acquired by the performance of sacrifices\n therefore those who die wiyout having realized the self and its right desires find no permanent happiness in any world to which they go while those who have realized the self and its right desires find permanent happiness everywhere\n the desires and intentions of those who have not realized the self even if seemingly fulfilled eventually evaporate and come to nothing\n but it is vastly different for those who know the self and act and will accordingly\n if the sage desires to see his fathers of the spirit world lo his fathers come to meet him\n in their company he is happy\n and if he desires to see his mothers of the spirit world lo his mothers come to meet him\n in their company he is happy\n and if he desires to see his brothers of the spirit world lo his brothers come to meet him\n in their company he is happy\n and if he desires to see his sisters of the spirit world lo his sisters come to meet him\n in their company he is happy\n and if he desires to see his friends of the spirit world lo his friends come to meet him\n in their company he is happy\n and if he desires heavenly perfumes and garlands lo heavenly perfumes and garlands come to him\n in their possession he is happy\n and if he desires heavenly food and drink lo heavenly food and drink come to him\n in their possession he is happy\n and if he desires heavenly song and music lo heavenly song and music come to him\n in their possession he is happy\n indeed whatsoever such a knower of brahman may desire straightway it is his and having obtained it he is exalted of men\n this is lengyour and perhaps not too obvious of meaning\n the idea is that the realized person has access to and embodies all that is positive from his past lives both persons and karmic conditions\n this being so he can obtain anything he desires and wills in the present and the future\n yet he is exalted of men in a different manner than the dead and departed greats of human history\n he is exalted in the self in brahman in absolute being\n the hallmark of sanatana dharma is its thorough practicality its good sense and its demonstrable truth\n so the upanishad next says the obstacle and its removal the fulfillment of right desires is within reach of everyone but a veil of illusion obstructs the ignorant\n that is why yough they desire to see their dead their beloved they cannot see them\n do we wish for our beloved among the living or among the dead or is there aught else for which we long yet for all our longing do not obtain lo all shall be ours if we but dive deep within even to the lotus of the heart where dwells the lord\n yea the object of every right desire is within our reach yough unseen concealed by a veil of illusion\n as one not knowing that a golden treasure lies buried beneath his feet may walk over it again and again yet never find it so all beings live every moment in the city of brahman yet never find him because of the veil of illusion by which he is concealed\n chandogya upanishad meditation is the key to the treasure house so the upanishad next says the self resides within the lotus of the heart\n knowing this devoted to the self the sage enters daily that holy sanctuary\n absorbed in the self the sage is freed from identity with the body and lives in blissful consciousness\n the self is the immortal the fearless the self is brahman\n this brahman is eternal truth\n om crossing the boundary the boundary self the self within the heart is like a boundary which divides the world from that\n day and night cross not that boundary nor old age nor death neither grief nor pleasure neither good nor evil deeds\n all evil shuns that\n for that is free from impurity by impurity can it never be touched\n setuh literally means a dam\n in the experience of conditioned beings within the realm of relativity the individual self or jivatman acts as a boundary between its supreme self brahman the paramatman and the world of samsara\n this is a very interesting fact made even more interesting by the fact that i have never encountered it except here in this section of the chandogya upanishad\n we may think of the self as a sea wall\n on one side is the vast ocean of brahman and on the other side is the earth of material form and change\n on one side the wall is experiencing the wetness of the sea and on the other the dryness of earth\n that in which the individual finds himself immersed only applies to that side of his being\n however much we may experience birth death change and all that attends them they never touch the realm of brahman\n conversely alyough we are living in and as brahman samsara never touches that\n samsara and brahman are mutually exclusive of one another\n but we participate in the worlds of both in a sense linking them with one another\n presently we are centered in samsara experiencing our own self as a barrier to reality\n but that barrier can be crossed so the upanishad continues wherefore he who has crossed that boundary and has realized the self if he is blind ceases to be blind if he is wounded ceases to be wounded if he is afflicted ceases to be afflicted\n when that boundary is crossed night becomes day for the world of brahman is light itself\n that is so powerful and obvious that there is no place for comment other than to point out that the conditions listed from which the knowers of the self are freed are really only illusions just mirages\n the self being real such illusions vanish when it is known\n the way across the boundary and that world of brahman is reached by those who practice continence brahmaacharya \n for the knower of eternal truth knows it through continence\n and what is known as worship yajna that also is continence\n for a man worships the lord by continence and thus attains him\n you cannot get more clear than this brahmacharya is the way to the realm of brahman brahmaloka \n certainly sexual continence is the core of brahmaacharya but it is really self restraint on all levels discipline\n this is it there is no other way to qualify for union with brahman than through brahmaacharya\n yoga is an essential for that union but frankly the practice of yoga is worthless wiyout brahmaacharya\n the proof of that is the american and european yoga scenes\n nothing is coming of it spiritually only profiteering and self delusion\n brahmacharya is the necessary worship sacrifice to know god\n as the beloved disciple wrote every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure\n i john why claim to follow sanatana dharma if the teachings of the upanishads and the gita are not followed but ignored and despised degraded but there is more\n liberation what is called salvation is really continence\n for through continence man is freed from ignorance\n and what is known as the vow of silence that too is continence\n for a man through continence realizes the self and lives in quiet contemplation\n perhaps i should explain a bit about this fulsome assurance that brahmaacharya will accomplish everything\n we like god are incarnate in a field of energy which we are intended to evolve just as god evolves the cosmos\n when the evolution is completed that is enlightenment and liberation\n this process requires the total application of the inner and outer powers energies of the individual powers that are devastatingly dissipated through sensory experience emotion and desire especially lust\n it is like a machine that requires a certain amount of voltage or an engine that cannot run wiyout the right amount of fuel\n this is a purely pragmatic proposition having nothing to do with concepts of right wrong good bad or any kind of moral valuation\n for example sex is not dirty it is destructive\n anything that diverts or dissipates the powers needed for evolution enlightenment is to be avoided\n it is not a sin but a hindrance a distraction\n for this reason the intelligent buddhic yogi is at all times vigilantly disciplined in other words a brahmaachari or brahmaacharini\n those who do not wish to pay the price of enlightenment are free to pass it by\n no one is under coercion\n to seek freedom the yogi must be free in that decision sankalpa and in the requisite disciplines for success in seeking\n the necessity for brahmaacharya is an absolute\n forest dwellers what people call dwelling in the forest aranyayanam that is continence\n this is the first sentence of chandogya upanishad \n most yogis have an inward pull to the forest life to live in the midst of real nature away from the noise and poisons of city life as well as the noise and pollutions of human society\n the gita describes the yogi as remaining in solitude alone and having distaste for crowds of men \n whether this is a samskara or an intuition it will be found in nearly all serious yogis\n one of my best friends was constantly going out into the wilds and risking life and limb so he would meditate far from any other human being\n i am not exaggerating about the risks he took\n one time he was literally starving and even wrote a note to anyone that might find his body saying that it was his unwise ways that caused his death and yoga should not be blamed\n he had been taken into the wilderness by another man but he had left his original camp and gone farther into the forest\n so when the man came back after some weeks to check on him he could not be found\n as my friend was lying on the ground preparing to die suddenly that man came walking up and asked where is that woman hardly able to speak my friend asked his own question what woman that woman with the long black hair in the orange dress if i hadn t followed her i couldn t have found you\n at first my friend was flummoxed but then he reached in his pack for his photograph of paramhansa yogananda\n is that the woman he asked holding it out to the man\n yes that s her the man replied\n the master certainly honored my friend s forest yearning however impractical\n solitude is a matter of interior condition\n the incredible russian orthodox saint saint john of kronstadt not only never slept he was never alone more than two hours in twenty four\n yet a man who knew him very well said father john was always alone\n in contrast are those that go miles away from any human being and take the whole world and its population right with them\n the teaching of the upanishad is that brahmacharya is the way to accomplish true inner solitude and quiet\n immortality in the world of brahman there is a lake whose waters are like nectar and whosoever tastes thereof is straightway drunk with joy and beside that lake is a tree which yields the juice of immortality\n into this world they cannot enter who do not practice continence\n for the world of brahman belongs to those who practice continence\n they alone enter that world and drink from that lake of nectar\n for them there is freedom in all the worlds\n since brahman is beyond materiality and even any kind of subtle name and form these verses are speaking symbolically of the immortality bestowing effects of union with brahman which can only be effected by those that practice brahmaacharya\n shankara agrees with me in his commentary\n the meaning is pretty obvious those who enter the ocean of brahman and drink will be filled with bliss made immortal with the immortality of brahman and will have access to all the worlds of relative existence and mastery in those worlds\n those who find the absolute do not lose the relative for the relative is a manifestation of the absolute\n the core idea like the preceding verses is the necessity of brahmaacharya\n devas and demons seeking the self it was said of old the self which is free from impurities from old age and death from grief from hunger and thirst which desires nothing but what it ought to desire and resolves nothing but what it ought to resolve is to be sought after is to be inquired about is to be realized\n he who learns about the self and realizes it obtains all the worlds and all desires\n this is the very heart of sanatana dharma the self must be known otherwise all is lost\n sri ramakrishna said it quite directly the purpose of human life is knowing god so those who do not strive to know god are wasting their life\n this is the truth of truth\n gods and demons the gods devas and demons asuras both heard of this truth and they yought to themselves let us seek after and realize this self so that we may obtain all the worlds and all desires\n thereupon indra from the gods and virochana from the demons went to prajapati the renowned teacher\n the sixteenth chapter of the bhagavad is devoted to the idea that human beings are divided into two types divine daivic and demonic asuras \n it should be carefully studied by those who see higher consciousness for it is bedrock truth\n here in the upanishad we are given an exposition of the two natures by means of a story\n it may seem that the gods and demons had a common goal to obtain all the worlds and all desires but that is not so\n it was certainly the aim of the demons but the gods desired the realization of the self alyough they certainly knew that all the worlds and all desires come to a knower of the self as a kind of side effect\n as jesus later said in israel seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you\n matthew the difference in the reactions of gods and demons can be seen today quite glaringly\n multitudes of demons throughout the world are spouting that we are all god and everything is god but with a complete misunderstanding of such statements\n for being entrenched in the ego and material consciousness they have no idea of the real nature of we and everything\n in the same way they have no comprehension of what the divine unity expounded in advaita non duality really means interpreting it according to their own ignorance and limitations reducing it to a string of childish cliches\n demons have a marked facility for trivializing anything and degradation is their particular skill\n approaching prajapati anyhow indra the king of the gods and virochana king of the demons both went to brahma to prajapati the creator\n for thirty two years they lived with him as pupils\n then prajapati asked them why they had both lived with him so long\n we have heard they replied that one who realizes the self obtains all the worlds and all desires\n we have lived here because we want to learn of this self\n this verse has a lesson not very obvious yet nonetheless important for us\n the two seekers lived with or near the teacher for many years wiyout asking for what they desired\n this is because the teacher should know the disciple and the disciple the guru\n when one of my friends dr\n mukherji met his guru sri swami purnananda of assam he was astonished at his evident greatness and asked to become his disciple\n not at all the master answered\n you must come to know me well and i must know you well\n visit me as often as you can and live with me for as much time as you can manage\n then after three years of observing each other we can talk about you learning yoga from me\n what a contrast with the drum beating self promoting gurus of today including those that pretend to have high standards for accepting disciples but really try to ensnare everyone their eyes rest upon\n and here we see that indra and virochana after thirty two years had not even brought up the subject of instruction\n we need not take so long but we should be very careful and not rush into accepting the teachings of anyone\n that is one of the value of books\n we can read them and discard them if we find them worthless wiyout any conflict with the teacher\n and we can apply them wiyout becoming the teacher s slave or dependent on him\n now we observe the first step in the discovery of the nature of the self\n it is not uncommon in the ancient texts for the truth to be presented as a kind of ladder starting with either a dim perception of the truth or even a complete misunderstanding and leading upward bit by bit until the complete truth is comprehended\n just why this was done has not been said\n perhaps it was to show that even mistaken or partial ideas were to be seen as steps on the way to perfect understanding\n or it may have been as a kind of yardstick by which the level of development of a person might be known\n on the other hand it may have been a showing of the logical progression of yought on a subject\n however it may be this account is part of that tradition\n the body the self then said prajapati that which is seen in the eye that is the self\n that is immortal that is fearless and that is brahman\n sir inquired the disciples is that the self which is seen reflected in the water or in a mirror the self is indeed seen reflected in these was the reply\n then prajapati added look at yourselves in the water and whatever you do not understand come and tell me about it\n indra and virochana gazed on their reflections in the water and returning to the sage they said sir we have seen the self we have seen even the hair and the nails\n then prajapati bade them don their finest clothes and look again in the water\n this they did and returning to the sage they said we have seen the self exactly like ourselves well adorned and in our finest clothes\n to which prajapati rejoined the self is indeed seen in these\n the self is immortal and fearless and it is brahman\n and the pupils went away well pleased\n brahma asked the two inquirers to have experience for themselves which they did\n notice that they were the first to put forth the idea that the body which is seen reflected in the water or in a mirror was the self\n puzzling as it seems there is a great lesson here\n it is better to be mistaken on our own than to have the truth imposed on us\n i have known of teachers in india agreeing to very silly ideas or proposals put forth by disciples because they wanted them to learn for themselves the error of their youghts\n this is absolutely unique to india and surely one of the reasons why so many disciples have become masters in their own right\n it is better for an idea to be ours even if wrong than to bow to the belief of another even if it is more correct\n the gita says better one s own dharma yough deficient than the dharma of another well performed\n the dharma of another invites danger and this applies to personal philosophy as well\n only when we have the freedom to make wrong conclusions will we develop the capacity for right conclusions\n intellectual integrity is of the utmost necessity however most religionists are opposed to it\n indra and virochana went away well pleased\n and this is normal\n the whole world is happy in delusions and illusions\n so a religion or philosophy that sait isfies us answers all our questions and in which we are happy may be completely worthless\n but we need to discover that for ourselves\n though their conclusions were wrong twice in this passage brahma has told them that brahman is immortal and fearless\n in this way he planted the seed of truth in their minds\n but prajapati looking after them lamented thus both of them departed wiyout analyzing or discriminating and wiyout truly comprehending the self\n whosoever follows a false doctrine of the self will perish\n now virochana sait isfied for his part that he had found out the self returned to the demons and began to teach them that the body alone is to be worshipped that the body alone is to be served and that he who worships the body and serves the body gains both worlds this and the next\n such doctrine is in very truth the doctrine of the demons chandogya upanishad \n the assertion that whosoever follows a false doctrine of the self will perish is crucial\n it tells us that youghts really are things and they lead us to a revelation of their nature if false to confusion and delusion and if true to the true\n jesus said according to your faith be it unto you\n matthew literally we are creating the world of our personal life sphere\n as we think it to be so it will tend to be yough much depends on the strength of our mind and the intensity put forth in exercising its creative power\n brahma let them hold a wrong concept of the self because they had to discover the right concept for themselves\n this is hard for those brought up in coercive religion to accept but it is true\n the nursery rhyme is right leave them alone and they will come home\n but only in the east will this faith in the individual be found\n wherever we find it in the west it is but a ray of the eastern light but none the less valuable for that\n body worship which is really only body enslavement is the faith of those possessing demonic nature and they literally do die for it\n when demons think about yoga it is always hatha yoga virochana yoga\n the myriads of yoga studios in the west are the haunts of the children of virochana\n but indra on his way back to the gods realized the uselessness of this knowledge\n as this self he reasoned seems to be well adorned when the body is well adorned well dressed when the body is well dressed so will it be blind when the body is blind lame when the body is lame deformed when the body is deformed\n when the body dies this same self will also die in such knowledge i can see no good\n so he returned to prajapati and asked for further instruction\n prajapati required him to live with him for another thirty two years after which time he taught him thus\n in eastern christianity they say that it is the nature of demons to fall and never rise and of human beings to fall and rise and fall and rise over and over again\n in the same way it is the nature of human demons to adopt an error and hold to it throughout their life\n but it is the nature of devic human beings to keep sifting through their ideas discarding the ones they discover to be mistaken and using the ones that are true as steps to even more and higher truth\n since indra was not a demon even before he got back to indraloka he understood the fallacy of identifying the body with the self\n his reasoning is quite clear\n so he returned to brahman for another period of time after which he was again instructed\n the astral body the self brahma told him that which moves about in dreams enjoying sensuous delights and clothed in glory that is the self\n that is immortal that is fearless and that is brahman\n pleased with what he had heard indra again departed\n but before he had reached the other gods he realized the uselessness of this knowledge also\n true it is he yought to himself that this self is not blind when the body is blind nor lame or hurt when the body is lame or hurt\n but even in dreams it is conscious of many sufferings\n so in this doctrine also i can see no good\n in the conscious waking state it is the physical body including the physical brain that dominates our consciousness but in the dream state it is the astral body and brain that come into function and dominate our awareness\n this astral body leaves the physical body at death so it is usually mistaken for the spirit self by the various religions\n but as indra realized this cannot be if the definition of the self formulated by the ancient rishis of india is believed to be accurate\n we must go a step higher\n the causal body the self so he went back to prajapati for further instruction\n prajapati now bade him live with him for another thirty two years and when the time had passed taught him saying when a man is sound asleep free from dreams and at perfect rest that is the self\n the self is immortal and fearless and it is brahman\n but before he had reached his home he felt the uselessness even of this knowledge\n in reality yought he one does not know oneself as this or as that while asleep\n one is not conscious in fact of any existence at all\n the state of one in deep sleep is next to annihilation\n i can see no good in this knowledge either\n so once more indra went back to prajapati who bade him stay with him yet five years\n in dreamless sleep the causal body is dominant and even in india there are people who try to identify it with the self and equate the dreamless sleep state with the eternal state of the self\n this is because of the extreme subtlety of that condition\n here too indra s reasoning is as clear as it is inevitable\n it is significant that brahma only required a residence of five years this last time\n obviously indra is so near the truth that a longer time of purification is not required\n the self as it is and when the time had passed he made known to him the highest truth of the self saying this body is mortal always gripped by death but within it dwells the immortal self\n this self when associated in our consciousness with the body is subject to pleasure and pain and so long as this association continues freedom from pleasure and pain can no man find\n but as this association ceases there cease also the pleasure and the pain\n rising above physical consciousness knowing the self to be distinct from the senses and the mind knowing it in its true light one rejoices and is free\n this is as inspiring as it is simple freedom and bliss not mere pleasure are the attributes of the self and of those who know the self\n therefore brahma concluded his teaching of indra with these words the gods the luminous ones meditate on the self and by so doing obtain all the worlds and all desires\n in like manner whosoever among mortals knows the self meditates upon it and realizes it he too obtains all the worlds and all desires",

viraj \n before him there had been no year\n he death reared him for as long as a year and after this period projected him\n when he was born death opened his mouth to swallow him \n he the babe cried bhan that became speech\n he yought if i kill him i shall be making very little food\n through that speech and the mind he projected all this whatever there is the vedas rig yajus and saman the metres the sacrifices men and animals\n whatever he projected he resolved to eat\n because he eats everything therefore aditi death is so called\n he who knows how aditi came to have this name of aditi becomes the eater of all this and everything becomes his food\n he desired let me sacrifice again with the great sacrifice \n he was tired and he was distressed\n while he was thus tired and distressed his reputation and strength departed\n the organs are reputation and strength\n when the organs departed the body began to swell but his mind was set on the body\n he desired let this body of mine be fit for a sacrifice and let me be embodied through this and entered it \n because the body swelled asvat therefore it came to be called asva horse \n and because it became fit for a sacrifice therefore the horse sacrifice came to be known as asvamedha\n he who knows it thus indeed knows the horse sacrifice\n imagining himself as the horse and letting it remain free he reflected on it \n after a year he sacrificed it to himself and dispatched the other animals to the gods\n therefore priests to this day sacrifice to prajapati the sanctified horse that is dedicated to all the gods\n he who shines yonder is the horse sacrifice his body is the year\n this fire is arka its limbs are these worlds\n so these two fire and the sun are arka and the horse sacrifice\n these two again become the same god death\n he who knows thus conquers further death death cannot overtake him it becomes his self and he becomes one with these deities\n there were two classes of prajapati s sons the gods and the asuras\n naturally the gods were fewer and the asuras more in number\n they vied with each other for the mastery of these worlds\n the gods said now let us surpass the asuras in this sacrifice through the udgitha \n they said to the organ of speech chant the udgitha for us \n all right said the organ of speech and chanted for them\n the common good that comes of the organ of speech it secured for the gods by chanting while the fine speaking it utilised for itself\n the asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass them\n they charged it and struck it with evil\n that evil is what we come across when one speaks improper things\n then they said to the nose chant the udgitha for us \n all right said the nose and chanted for them\n the common good that comes of the nose it secured for the gods by chanting while the fine smelling it utilised for itself\n the asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass them\n they charged it and struck it with evil\n that evil is what we come across when one smells improper things\n then they said to the eye chant the udgitha for us \n all right said the eye and chanted for them\n the common good that comes of the eye it secured for the gods by chanting while the fine seeing it utilised for itself\n the asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass them\n they charged it and struck it with evil\n that evil is what we come across when one sees improper things\n then they said to the ear chant the udgitha for us \n all right said the ear and chanted for them\n the common good that comes of the ear it secured for the gods by chanting while the fine hearing it utilised for itself\n the asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass them\n they charged it and struck it with evil\n that evil is what we come across when one hears improper things\n then they said to the mind chant the udgitha for us \n all right said the mind and chanted for them\n the common good that comes of the mind it secured for the gods by chanting while the fine thinking it utilised for itself\n the asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass them\n they charged it and struck it with evil\n that evil is what we come across when one thinks improper things\n likewise they also touched these other deities with evil struck them with evil\n then they said to this vital force in the mouth chant the udgitha for us \n all right said the vital force and chanted for them\n the asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass them\n they charged it and wanted to strike it with evil\n but as a clod of earth striking against a rock is shattered so were they shattered flung in all directions and perished\n therefore the gods became fire etc\n and the asuras were crushed\n he who knows thus becomes his true self and his envious kinsman is crushed\n they said where was he who has thus restored us to our divinity and discovered here he is within the mouth \n the vital force is called ayasya angirasa for it is the essence of the members of the body \n this deity is called dur because death is far from it\n death is far from one who knows thus\n this deity took away death the evil of these gods and carried it to where these quarters end\n there it left their evils\n therefore one should not approach a person of that region nor go to that region beyond the border lest one imbibe that evil death\n this deity after taking away death the evil of these gods next carried them beyond death\n it carried the organ of speech the foremost one first\n when the organ of speech got rid of death it became fire\n that fire having transcended death shines beyond its reach\n then it carried the nose\n when it got rid of death it became air\n that air having transcended death blows beyond its reach\n then it carried the eye\n when the eye got rid of death it became sun\n that sun having transcended death shines beyond its reach\n then it carried the ear when the ear got rid of death it became the quarters\n those quarters having transcended death remain beyond its reach\n then it carried the mind\n when the mind got rid of death it became the moon\n that moon having transcended death shines beyond its reach\n so does this deity carry one who knows thus beyond death\n next it secured eatable food for itself by chanting for whatever food is eaten is eaten by the vital force alone and it rests on that\n the gods said whatever food there is is just this much and you have secured it for yourself by chanting\n now let us have a share in this food\n then sit around facing me said the vital force \n all right said the gods and sat down around it\n hence whatever food one eats through the vital force sait isfies these\n so do his relatives sit around facing him who knows thus and he becomes their support the greatest among them and their leader a good eater of food and the ruler of them\n that one among his relatives who desires to rival a man of such knowledge is powerless to support his dependants\n but one who follows him or desires to maintain one s dependants being under him is alone capable of supporting them\n it is called ayasya angirasa for it is the essence of the members of the body \n the vital force is indeed the essence of the members\n of course it is their essence\n for instance from whichever member the vital force departs right there it withers\n therefore this is of course the essence of the members\n this alone is also brihaspati lord of the rik \n speech is indeed brihati rik and this is its lord\n therefore this is also brihaspati\n this alone is also brahmanaspati lord of the yajus \n speech is indeed brahman yajus and this is its lord\n therefore this is also brahmanaspati\n this alone is also saman\n speech is indeed sa and this is ama\n because it is sa speech and ama vital force therefore saman is so called\n or because it is equal to a white ant equal to a mosquito equal to an elephant equal to these three worlds equal to this universe therefore this is also saman\n he who knows this saman vital force to be such attains union with it or lives in the same world as it\n this indeed is also udgitha\n the vital force is indeed ut for all this is held aloft by the vital force and speech alone is githa\n this is udgitha because it is ut and githa\n regarding this there is also a story brahmadatta the great grandson of cikitana while drinking soma said let this soma strike off my head if i say that ayasya angirasa chanted the udgitha through any other than this vital force and speech \n indeed he chanted through speech and the vital force\n he who knows the wealth of this saman vital force attains wealth\n tone is indeed its wealth\n therefore one who is going to officiate as a priest should desire to have a rich tone in his voice and he should do his priestly duties through that voice with a fine tone\n therefore in a sacrifice people long to see a priest with a good voice like one who has wealth\n he who knows the wealth of saman to be such attains wealth\n he who knows the gold of this saman vital force obtains gold\n tone is indeed its gold\n he who knows the gold of saman to be such obtains gold\n he who knows the support of this saman vital force gets a resting place\n speech certain parts of the body is indeed its support\n for resting on speech is the vital force thus chanted\n some say resting on food body \n now therefore the edifying repetition adhyaroha only of the hymns called pavamanas\n the priest called prastotir indeed recites the saman\n while he recites it these mantras are to be repeated from evil lead me to good\n from darkness lead me to light\n from death lead me to immortality\n when the mantra says from evil lead me to good evil means death and good immortality so it says from death lead me to immortality i\n when it says from darkness lead me to light darkness means death and light immortality so it says from death lead me to immortality or make me immortal \n in the dictum from death lead me to immortality the meaning does not seem to be hidden\n then through the remaining hymns the chanter should secure eatable food for himself by chanting\n therefore while they are being chanted the sacrificer should ask for a boon anything that he desires\n whatever objects this chanter possessed of such knowledge desires either for himself or for the sacrificer he secures them by chanting\n this meditation certainly wins the world hiranyagarbha \n he who knows the saman vital force as such has not to pray lest he be unfit for this world\n in the beginning this universe was but the self viraj of a human form\n he reflected and found nothing else but himself\n he first uttered am he therefore he was called aham i \n hence to this day when a person is addressed he first says it is i and then says the other name that he may have\n because he was first and before this whole band of aspirants burnt all evils therefore he is called purusha\n he who knows thus indeed burns one who wants to be viraj before him\n therefore people still are afraid to be alone\n he yought if there is nothing else but me what am i afraid of from that alone his fear was gone for what was there to fear it is from a second entity that fear comes\n he was not at all happy\n therefore people still are not happy when alone\n he desired a mate\n he became as big as man and wife embracing each other\n he parted this very body into two\n from that came husband and wife\n therefore said yajnavalkya this body is one half of oneself like one of the two halves of a split pea\n therefore this space is indeed filled by the wife\n he was united with her\n from that men were born\n she yought how can he be united with me after producing me from himself well let me hide myself \n she became a cow the other became a bull and was united with her from that cows were born\n the one became a mare the other a stallion the one became a she ass the other became a he ass and was united with her from that onehoofed animals were born\n the one became a she goat the other a he goat the one became a ewe the other became a ram and was united with her from that goats and sheep were born\n thus did he project every thing that exists in pairs down to the ants\n he knew i indeed am the creation for i projected all this \n therefore he was called creation\n he who knows this as such becomes a creator in this creation of viraj\n then he rubbed back and forth thus and produced fire from its source the mouth and the hands\n therefore both these are wiyout hair at the inside\n when they talk of particular gods saying sacrifice to him sacrifice to the other one they are wrong since these are all his projection for he is all the gods\n now all this that is liquid he produced from the seed\n this universe is indeed this much food and the eater of food\n soma is food and fire the eater of food\n this is super creation of viraj that he projected the gods who are even superior to him\n because he alyough mortal himself projected the immortals therefore this is a super creation\n he who knows this as such becomes a creator in this super creation of viraj\n this universe was then undifferentiated\n it differentiated only into name and form it was called such and such and was of such and such form\n so to this day it is differentiated only into name and form it is called such and such and is of such and such form\n this self has entered into these bodies up to the tip of the nails as a razor may be put in its case or as fire which sustains the world may be in its source\n people do not see it for viewed in its aspects it is incomplete\n when it does the function of living\n it is called the vital force when it speaks the organ of speech when it sees the eye when it hears the ear and when it thinks the mind\n these are merely its names according to functions\n he who meditates upon each of this totality of aspects does not know for it is incomplete being divided from this totality by possessing a single characteristic\n the self alone is to be meditated upon for all these are unified in it\n of all these this self should be realised for one knows all these through it just as one may get an animal through its foot prints\n he who knows it as such obtains fame and association with his relatives \n this self is dearer than a son dearer than wealth dearer than everything else and is innermost\n should a person holding the self as dear say to one calling anything else dearer than the self what you hold dear will die he is certainly competent to say so it will indeed come true\n one should meditate upon the self alone as dear\n of him who meditates upon the self alone as dear the dear ones are not mortal\n they say men think through the knowledge of brahman we shall become all \n well what did that brahman know by which it became all this self was indeed brahman in the beginning\n it knew only itself as i am brahman \n therefore it became all\n and whoever among the gods knew it also became that and the same with sages and men\n the sage vamadeva while realising this self as that knew i was manu and the sun \n and to this day whoever in like manner knows it as i am brahman becomes all this universe \n even the gods cannot prevail against him for he becomes their self\n while he who worships another god thinking he is one and i am another does not know\n he is like an animal to the gods\n as many animals serve a man so does each man serve the gods\n even if one animal is taken away it causes anguish what should one say of many animals therefore it is not liked by them that men should know this\n in the beginning this the kshatriya and other castes was indeed brahman one only\n being one he did not flourish\n he specially projected an excellent form the kshatriya those who are kshatriyas among the gods indra varuna the moon rudra parjanya yama death and isana\n therefore there is none higher than the kshatriya\n hence the brahmana worships the kshatriya from a lower position in the rajasuya sacrifice\n he imparts that glory to the kshatriya\n the brahmana is the source of the kshatriya\n therefore alyough the king attains supremacy in the sacrifice at the end of it he resorts to the brahmana his source\n he who slights the brahmana strikes at his own source\n he becomes more wicked as one is by slighting one s superior\n yet he did not flourish\n he projected the vaisya those species of gods who are designated in groups the vasus rudras adityas visvadevas and maruts\n he did not still flourish\n he projected the sudra caste pusan\n this earth is pusan\n for it nourishes all this that exists\n yet he did not flourish\n he specially projected that excellent form righteousness dharma \n this righteousness is the controller of the kshatriya\n therefore there is nothing higher than that\n so even a weak man hopes to defeat a stronger man through righteousness as one contending with the king\n that righteousness as one contending with the king\n that righteousness is verily truth\n therefore they say about a person speaking of truth he speaks of righteousness or about a person speaking of righteousness he speaks of truth for both these are but righteousness\n so these four castes were projected the brahmana kshatriya vaisya and sudra\n he became a brahmana among the gods as fore and among men as the brahmana\n he became a kshatriya through the divine kshatriyas a vaisya through the divine vaisyas and a sudra through the divine sudra\n therefore people desire to attain the results of their rites among the gods through fire and among men as the brahmana\n for brahman was in these two forms\n if however anybody departs from this world wiyout realising his own world the self it being unknown does not protect him as the vedas not studied or any other work not undertaken do not \n even if a man who does not know it as such performs a great many meritorious acts in the world those acts of his are surely exhausted in the end\n one should meditate only upon the world of the self\n he who meditates only upon the world called the self never has his work exhausted\n from this very self he projects whatever he wants\n now this self the ignorant man is an object of enjoyment to all beings\n that he makes oblations in the fire and performs sacrifices is how he becomes such an object to the gods\n that he studies the vedas is how he becomes an object of enjoyment to the rishis sages \n that he makes offerings to the manes and desires children is how he becomes such an object to the manes\n that he gives shelter to men as well as food is how he becomes an object of enjoyment to men\n that he gives fodder and water to the animals is how he becomes such an object to hem\n and that beasts and birds and even the ants feed in his home is how he becomes an object of enjoyment to these\n just as one wishes safety to one s body so do all beings wish safety to him who knows it as such\n this indeed has been known and discussed\n this aggregate of desirable objects was but the self in the beginning the only entity\n he desired let me have a wife so that i may be born as the child \n and let me have wealth so that i may perform rites \n this much indeed is the range of desire\n even if one wishes one cannot get more than this\n therefore to this day a man being single desires let me have a wife so that i may be born\n and let me have wealth so that i may perform rites\n until he obtains each one of these he considers himself incomplete\n his completeness also comes thus the mind is his self speech his wife the vital force his child the eye his human wealth for he obtains it through the eye the ear his divine wealth for he hears of it through the ear and the body is its instrument of rite for he performs rites through the body\n so this sacrifice has five factors the animals have five factors the men have five factors and all this that exists has five factors\n he who knows it as such attains all this\n that the father produced seven kinds of food through meditation and rites i shall disclose \n one is common to all eaters\n two he apportioned to the gods\n three he designed for himself\n and one he gave to the animals\n on it rests everything what lives and what does not\n why are they not exhausted alyough they are always being eaten he who knows this cause of their permanence eats food with pratika pre eminence \n he attains identity with the gods and lives on nectar\n these are the verses\n that the father produced seven kinds of food through meditation and rites means that the father indeed produced them through meditation and rites\n one is common to all eaters means this food that is eaten is the common food of all eaters\n he who adores monopolises this food is never free from evil for this is general food\n two he apportioned to the gods means making oblations in the fire and offering presents otherwise to the gods\n therefore people perform both these\n some however say those two are the new and full moon sacrifices\n therefore one should not be engrossed with sacrifices for material ends\n one he gave to the animals it is milk\n for men and animals first live on milk alone\n therefore they first make a new born babe lick clarified butter or suckle it\n and they speak of a new born calf as not yet eating grass\n on it rests everything what lives and what does not means that on milk indeed rests all this that lives and that does not\n it is said that by making offerings of milk in the fire for a year one conquers further death\n one should not think like that\n he who knows as above conquers further death the very day he makes that offering for he offers all eatable food to the gods why are they not exhausted alyough they are always being eaten means that the being eater is indeed the cause of their permanence for the produces this food again and again\n he who knows this cause of their permanence means that the being eater is indeed the cause of their permanence for he produces this food through his meditation for the time being and rites\n if he does not do this it will be exhausted\n he eats food with pratika pratika means pre eminence hence the meaning is preeminently\n he attains the gods and lives on nectar is a eulogy\n three he designed for himself means the mind the organ of speech and the vital force these he designed for himself\n they say i was absent minded i did not see it i was absent minded i did not hear it \n it is through the mind that one sees and hears\n desires resolve doubt faith want of faith steadiness unsteadiness shame intelligence and fear all these are but the mind\n even if one is touched from behind one knows it through the mind therefore the mind exists \n and any kind of sound is but the organ of speech for it serves to determine a thing but it cannot itself be revealed\n prana apana vyana udana samana and ana all these are but the vital forces\n this body is identified with these with the organ of speech the mind and the vital force\n these are the three worlds\n the organ of speech is this world the earth the mind is the sky and the vital force is that world heaven \n these are the three vedas\n the organ of speech is the rig veda the mind is the yajur veda and the vital force the sama veda\n these are the gods the manes and men\n the organ of speech is the gods the mind the manes and the vital force men\n these are the father mother and child\n the mind is the father the organ of speech the mother and the vital force the child\n these are what is known what it is desirable to know and what is unknown\n whatever is known is a form of the organ of speech for it is the knower\n the organ of speech protects him who knows this by becoming that which is known \n whatever it is desirable to know is a form of the mind for the mind is what it is desirable to know\n the mind protects him who knows this by becoming that which it is desirable to know \n whatever is unknown is a form of the vital force for the vital force is what is unknown\n the vital force protects him who knows this by becoming that which is unknown \n the earth is the body of that organ of speech and this fire is its luminous organ\n and as far as the organ of speech extends so far extends the earth and so far does this fire\n heaven is the body of this mind and that sun is its luminous organ\n and as far as the mind extends so far extends heaven and so far does that sun\n the two were united and from that the vital force emanated\n it is the supreme lord\n it is wiyout a rival\n a second being is indeed a rival\n he who knows it as such has no rival\n water is the body of this vital force and that moon is its luminous organ\n and as far as the vital force extends so far extends water and so far does that moon\n these are all equal and all infinite\n he who meditates upon these as finite wins a finite world but he who meditates upon these as infinite wins an infinite world\n this prajapati hiranyagarbha has sixteen digits and is represented by the year\n the nights and days are his fifteen digits and the constant one is his sixteenth digit\n he as the moon is filled as well as wasted by the nights and days \n through this sixteenth digit he permeates all these living beings on the new moon night and rises the next morning\n therefore on this night one should not take the life of living beings not even of a chameleon in adoration of this deity alone\n that prajapati who has sixteen digits and is represented by the year is indeed this man who knows as above\n wealth constitutes his fifteen digits and the body his sixteenth digit\n he is filled as well as wasted by wealth\n this body stands for a nave and wealth is the felloe\n therefore if a man loses everything but he himself lives people say that he has only lost his outfit\n there are indeed three worlds the world of men the world of the manes and the world of the gods\n this world of men is to be won through the son alone and by no other rite the world of the manes through rites and the world of the gods through meditation\n the world of the gods is the best of the worlds\n therefore they praise meditation\n now therefore the entrusting when a man thinks he will die he says to his son you are brahman you are the sacrifice and you are the world \n the son replies i am brahman i am the sacrifice and i am the world\n the father thinks whatever is studied is all unified in the word brahman \n whatever sacrifices there are are all unified in the word sacrifice \n and whatever worlds there are are all unified in the world world \n all this the duties of a householder is indeed this much\n he being all this will protect me from the ties of this world\n therefor they speak of an educated son as being conducive to the world\n hence a father teaches his son\n when a father who knows as above departs from this world he penetrates his son together with the organ of speech the mind and the vital force\n should anything be left undone by him through any slip the son exonerates him from all that\n therefore he is called a son\n the father lives in this world through the son\n divine and immortal speech mind and vital force permeate him\n the divine organ of speech from the earth and fire permeates him\n that is the divine organ of speech through which whatever he says is fulfilled\n the divine mind from heaven and the sun permeates him\n that is the divine mind through which he only becomes happy and never mourns\n the divine vital force from water and the moon permeates him\n that is the divine vital force which when it moves or does not move feels no pain nor is injured\n he who knows as above becomes the self of all beings\n as is this deity hiranyagarbha so is he\n as all beings take care of this deity so do they take care of him\n howsoever these beings may grieve that grief of theirs is connected with them\n but only merit goes to him\n no demerit ever goes to the gods\n now a consideration of the vow prajapati projected the organs\n these on being projected quarrelled with one another\n the organ of speech took a vow i will go on speaking \n the eye i will see \n the ear i will hear \n and so did the other organs according to their functions\n death captured them in the form of fatigue it overtook the and having overtaken them it controlled them\n therefore the organ of speech invariably gets tired and so do the eye and the ear\n but death did not overtake this vital force in the body\n the organs resolved to know it\n this is the greatest among us that when it moves or does not move feels no pain nor is injured\n well let us all be of its form\n they all assumed its form\n therefore they are called by this name of prana \n that family in which a man is born who knows as above is indeed named after him\n and he who competes with one who knows as above shrivels and after shrivelling dies at the end\n this is with reference to the body\n now with reference to the gods fire took a vow i will go on burning\n the sun i will give heat \n the moon i will shine \n and so did the other gods according to their functions\n as is the vital force in the body among these organs so is vayu air among these gods\n other gods sink but not air\n air is the deity that never sets\n now there is this verse the gods observed the vow of that from which the sun rises and in which he sets\n it is followed to day and it will be followed to morrow\n the sun indeed rises from the vital force and also sets in it\n what these gods observed then they observe to this day\n therefore a man should observe a single vow do the functions of the prana and apana respiration and excretion lest the evil of death fatigue should overtake him\n and if he observes it he should seek to finish it\n through it he attains identity with this deity or lives in the same world with it\n this universe indeed consists of three things name form and action\n of those names speech sound in general is the uktha source for all names spring from it\n it is their saman common feature for it is common to all names\n it is their brahman self for it sustains all names\n now of forms the eye anything visible is the uktha source for all forms spring from it\n it is their saman common feature for it is common to all forms\n it is their brahman self for it sustains all forms\n and of actions the body activity is the uktha source for all actions spring from it\n it is their saman common feature for it is common to all actions\n it is their brahman self for it sustains all actions\n these three together are one this body and the body alyough one is these three\n this immortal entity is covered by truth the five elements the vital force is the immortal entity and name and form and truth so this vital force is covered by them\n there was a man of the garga family called proud balaki who was a speaker\n he said to ajatasatru the king of benares i will tell you about brahman \n ajatasatru said for this proposal i give you a yousand cows \n people indeed rush saying janaka janaka \n i too have some of his qualities\n gargya said that being who is in the sun i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as all surpassing as the head of all beings and as resplendent\n he who meditates upon him as such becomes all surpassing the head of all beings and resplendent\n gargya said that being who is in the moon i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as the great white robed radiant soma\n he who meditates upon him as such has abundant soma pressed in his principal and auxiliary sacrifices every day and his food never gets short\n gargya said that being who is in lightning i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as powerful \n he who meditates upon him as such becomes powerful and his progeny too becomes powerful\n gargya said this being who is in the ether i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as full and unmoving \n he who meditates upon him as such is filled with progeny and cattle and his progeny is never extinct from this world\n gargya said this being who is in air i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as the lord as irresistible and as the unvanquished army\n he who meditates upon him as such ever becomes victorious and invincible and conquers his enemies\n gargya said this being who is in fire i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as forbearing \n he who meditates upon him as such becomes forbearing and his progeny too becomes forbearing\n gargya said this being who is in water i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as agreeable \n he who meditates upon him as such has only agreeable things coming to him and not contrary ones also from him are born children who are agreeable\n gargya said this being who is in a looking glass i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as shining \n he who meditates upon him as such becomes shining and his progeny too becomes shining\n he also outshines all those with whom he comes in contact\n gargya said this sound that issues behind a man as he walks i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as life \n he who meditates upon him as such attains his full term of life in this world and life does not depart from him before the completion of that term\n gargya said this being who is in the quarters i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as second and as non separating \n he who meditates upon him as such gets companions and his followers never depart from him\n gargya said this being who identifies himself with the shadow i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as death \n he who meditates upon him as such attains his full term of life in this world and death does not overtake him before the completion of that term\n gargya said this being who is in the self i meditate upon as brahman \n ajatasatru said please don t talk about him\n i meditate upon him as self possessed\n he who meditates upon him as such becomes self possessed and his progeny too becomes self possessed\n ajatasatru said is this all this is all \n by knowing this much one cannot know brahman \n gargya said i approach you as a student \n ajatasatru said it is contrary to usage that a brahmana should approach a kshatriya thinking he will teach me about brahman \n however i will instruct you \n taking gargya by the hand he rose\n they came to a sleeping man\n ajatasatru addressed him by these names great white robed radiant soma \n the man did not get up\n the king pushed him with the hand till he awoke\n then he got up\n ajatasatru said when this being full of consciousness identified with the mind was thus asleep where was it and whence did it thus come gargya did not know that\n ajatasatru said when this being full of consciousness is thus asleep it absorbs at the time the functions of the organs through its own consciousness and lies in the akasa supreme self that is in the heart\n when this being absorbs them it is called svapiti\n then the nose is absorbed the organ of speech is absorbed the eye is absorbed the ear is absorbed and the mind is absorbed \n when it thus remains in the dream state these are its achievements it then becomes an emperor as it were or a noble brahmana as it were or attains states high or low as it were\n as an emperor taking his citizens moves about as he pleases in his own territory so does it thus taking the organs move about as it pleases in its own body\n again when it becomes fast asleep when it does not know anything it comes back along the seventy two yousand nerves called hita which extend from the heart to the pericardium the whole body and remains in the body\n as a baby or an emperor or a noble brahmana lives having attained the acme of bliss so does it remain\n as a spider moves along the thread it produces and as from a fire tiny sparks fly in all directions so from this self emanate all organs all worlds all gods and all beings\n its secret name upanishad is the truth of truth \n the vital force is truth and it is the truth of that\n he who knows the calf with its abode its special resort its post and its tether kills his seven envions kinsmen the vital force in the body is indeed the calf this body is its abode the head its special resort strength its post and food its tether\n these seven gods that prevent decay worship it through these pink lines in the eye rudra attends on it through the water that is in the eye parjanya through the pupil the sun through the dark portion fire through the white portion indra through the lower eye lid the earth attends on it and through the upper eye lid heaven\n he who knows it as such never has any decrease of food\n regarding this there is the following piyour verse there is a bowl that has its opening below and bulges at the top various kinds of knowledge have been put in it seven sages sit by its side and the organ of speech which has communication with the vedas is the eighth \n the bowl that has its opening below and bulges at the top is the head of ours for it is the bowl that has its opening below and bulges at the top\n various kinds of knowledge have been put in it refers to the organs these indeed represent various kinds of knowledge\n seven sages sit by its side refers to the organs they indeed are the sages\n the organ of speech which has communication with the vedas is the eighth because the organ of speech is the eighth and communicates with the vedas\n these two ears are gotama and bharadvaja this one is gotama and this one is bharadvaja these two eyes are visvamitra and jamadagni this one is visvamitra and this one jamadagni\n these two nostrils are vasistha and kashyapa this one is vasistha and this one kashyapa the tongue is atri for through the tongue food is eaten\n atri is but this name atti \n he who knows it as such becomes the eater of all and everything becomes his food\n brahman has but two forms gross and subtle mortal and immortal limited and unlimited defined and undefined\n the gross form is that which is other than air and the ether\n it is mortal it is limited and it is defined\n the essence of that which is gross mortal limited and defined is the sun that shines for it is the essence of the defined\n now the subtle it is air and the ether\n it is immortal it is unlimited and it is undefined\n the essence of that which is subtle immortal unlimited and undefined is the being that is in the sun for that is the essence of the undefined\n this is with reference to the gods\n now with reference to the body the gross form is but this what is other than the corporeal air and the ether that is in the body\n it is mortal it is limited and it is defined\n the essence of that which is gross mortal limited and defined is the eye for it is the essence of the defined\n now the subtle it is the corporeal air and the ether that is in the body\n it is immortal it is unlimited and it is undefined\n the essence of that which is subtle immortal unlimited and undefined is this being that is in the right eye for this is the essence of the undefined\n the form of that being is as follows like a cloth dyed with turmeric or like grey sheep s wool or like the scarlet insect called indragopa or like a tongue of fire or like a white lotus or like a flash of lightning\n he who knows it as such attains splendour like a flash of lightning\n now therefore the description of brahman not this not this \n because there is no other and more appropriate description than this not this \n now its name the truth of truth \n the vital force is truth and it is the truth of that\n maitreyi my dear said yajnavalkya i am going to renounce this life\n allow me to finish between you and katyayani \n thereupon maitreyi said sir if indeed this whole earth full of wealth be mine shall i be immortal through that no replied yajnavalkya your life will be just like that of people who have plenty of things but there is no hope of immortality through wealth\n then maitreyi said what shall i do with that which will not make me immortal tell me sir of that alone which you know to be the only means of immortality \n yajnavalkya said my dear you have been my beloved even before and you say what is after my heart\n come take your seat i will explain it to you\n as i explain it meditate on its meaning \n he said it is not for the sake of the husband my dear that he is loved but for one s own sake that he is loved\n it is not for the sake of the wife my dear that she is loved but for one s own sake that she is loved\n it is not for the sake of the sons my dear that they are loved but for one s own sake that they are loved\n it is not for the sake of wealth my dear that it is loved but for one s own sake that it is loved\n it is not for the sake of the brahmana my dear that he is loved but for one s own sake that he is loved\n it is not for the sake of the kshatriya my dear that he is loved but for one s own sake that he is loved\n it is not for the sake of worlds my dear that they are loved but for one s own sake that they are loved\n it is not for the sake of the gods my dear that they are loved but for one s own sake that they are loved\n it is not for the sake of beings my dear that they are loved but for one s own sake that they are loved\n it is not for the sake of all my dear that all is loved but for one s own sake that it is loved\n the self my dear maitreyi should be realised should be heard of reflected on and meditated upon\n by the realisation of the self my dear through hearing reflection and meditation all this is known\n the brahmana ousts slights one who knows him as different from the self\n the kshatriya ousts one who knows him as different from the self\n worlds oust one who knows them as different from the self\n the gods oust one who knows them as different from the self\n beings oust one who knows them as different from the self\n all ousts one who knows it as different from the self\n this brahmana this kshatriya these worlds these gods these beings and this all are this self\n as when a drum is beaten one cannot distinguish its various particular notes but they are included in the general note of the drum or in the general sound produced by different kinds of strokes\n as when a conch is blown one cannot distinguish its various particular notes but they are included in the general note of the conch or in the general sound produced by different kinds of playing\n as when a vina is played one cannot distinguish its various particular notes but they are included in the general note of the vina or in the general sound produced by different kinds of playing\n as from a fire kindled with wet faggot diverse kinds of smoke issue even so my dear the rig veda yajur veda sama veda atharvangirasa history mythology arts upanishads piyour verses aphorisms elucidations and explanations are like the breath of this infinite reality\n they are like the breath of this supreme self \n as the ocean is the one goal of all sorts of water as the skin is the one goal of all kinds of touch as the nostrils are the one goal of all odours as the tongue is the one goal of all savours as the eye is the one goal of all colours as the ear is the one goal of all sounds as the manas is the one goal of all deliberations as the intellect is the one goal of all kinds of knowledge as the hands are the one goal of all sort of work as the organ of generation is the one goal of all kinds of enjoyment as the anus is the one goal of all excretions as the feet are the one goal of all kinds of walking as the organ of speech is the one goal of all vedas\n as a lump of salt dropped into water dissolves with its component water and no one is able to pick it up but from wheresoever one takes it it tastes salt even so my dear this great endless infinite reality is but pure intelligence\n the self comes out as a separate entity from these elements and this separateness is destroyed with them\n after attaining this oneness it has no more consciousness\n this is what i say my dear\n maitreyi said just here you have thrown me into confusion sir by saying that after attaining oneness the self has no more consciousness \n yajnavalkya said certainly i am not saying anything confusing my dear this is quite sufficient for knowledge o maitreyi \n because when there is duality as it were then one smells something one sees something one hears something one speaks something one thinks something one knows something\n but when to the knower of brahman everything has become the self then what should one smell and through what what should one see and through what what should one hear and through what what should one speak and through what what should one think and through what what should one know and through what through what should one know that owing to which all this is known through what o maitreyi should one know the knower this earth is like honey to all beings and all beings are like honey

is that meditation on things mutually helpful which dadhyac versed in the atharva veda taught the asvins\n perceiving this the rishi mantra said o asvins in human form that terrible deed called damsa which you committed out of greed i will disclose as a cloud does rain how you learnt the meditation on things mutually helpful that dadhyac versed in the atharva veda taught you through a horse s head\n this is that meditation on things mutually helpful which dadhyac versed in the atharva veda taught the asvins\n perceiving this the rishi said o asvins you set a horse s head on the shoulders of dadhyac versed in the atharva veda\n o terrible ones to keep his word he taught you the ritualistic meditation on things mutually helpful connected with the sun as also the secret spiritual meditation on them\n this is that meditation on things mutually helpful which dadhyac versed in the atharva veda taught the asvins\n perceiving this the rishi said he made bodies with two feet and bodies with four feet\n that supreme being first entered the bodies as a bird the subtle body \n on account of his dwelling in all bodies he is called the purusha\n there is nothing that is not covered by him nothing that is not pervaded by him\n this is that meditation on things mutually helpful which dadhyac versed in the atharva veda taught the asvins\n perceiving this the rishi said he transformed himself in accordance with each form that form of his was for the sake of making him known\n the lord on account of maya notions superimposed by ignorance is perceived as manifold for to him are yoked ten organs nay hundreds of them\n he is the organs he is ten and yousands many and infinite\n that brahman is wiyout prior or posterior wiyout interior or exterior\n this self the perceiver of everything is brahman\n this is the teaching\n now the line of teachers pautimasya received it from gaupavana\n gaupavana from another pautimasya\n this pautimasya from another gaupavana\n this gaupavana from kausika\n sandilya from kausika and gautama\n gautama from agnivesya\n agnivesya from sandilya and anabhimlata\n anabhimlata from another of that name\n he from a third

sanaga from paramesthin viraj \n he from brahman hiranyabarbha \n brahman is self born\n janaka emperor of videha performed a sacrifice in which gifts were freely distributed\n vedic scholars from kuru and panchala were assembled there\n emperor janaka of videha had a desire to know which is the most erudite of these vedic scholars he had a yousand cows confined in a pen and on the horns of each cow were fixed ten padas of gold \n he said to them revered brahmanas let him who is the best vedic scholar among you drive these cows home \n none of the brahmanas dared\n then yajnavalkya said to a pupil of his dear samasravas please drive these cows home \n the brahmanas were enraged\n how does he dare to call himself the best vedic scholar among us there was a hotr of emperor janaka of videha named asvala\n he now asked yajnavalkya yajnavalkya are you indeed the best vedic scholar among us yajnavalkya replied i bow to the best vedic scholar i just want the cows \n thereupon the hotr asvala determined to interrogate him\n yajnavalkya said he since all this is overtaken by death and swayed by it by what means does the sacrificer go beyond the clutches of death through the organ of speech through fire which is the real priest called hotr\n the sacrificer s organ of speech is the hotr\n this organ of speech is fire this fire is the hotr this fire is liberation this liberation is emancipation \n yajnavalkya said he since all this is overtaken by day and night and swayed by them by what means does the sacrificer go beyond the clutches of day and night through the eye through the sun which is the real priest called adhvaryu\n the eye of the sacrificer is the adhvaryu\n this eye is the sun this sun is the adhvaryu this sun is liberation this liberation is emancipation \n yajnavalkya said he since all this is overtaken by the bright and dark fortnights and swayed by them by what means does the sacrificer go beyond the bright and dark fortnights through the vital force through air which is the real priest called udgatir\n the vital force of the sacrificer is the udgatir\n this vital force is air and it is the udgatir this air is liberation this liberation is emancipation\n yajnavalkya said he since the sky is as it were wiyout a support through what support does the sacrificer go to heaven through the mind through the moon which is the real priest called brahman\n the mind of the sacrificer is the brahman\n this mind is the moon the moon is the brahman this moon is liberation this liberation is emancipation \n so far about the ways of emancipation now about the meditations based on resemblance\n yajnavalkya said he with how many kinds of rik will the hotr do his part in this sacrifice to day with three kinds \n which are those three the preliminary the sacrificial and the eulogistic hymns as the third \n what does he win through them all this that is living \n yajnavalkya said he how many kinds of oblations will the adhvaryu offer in this sacrifice to day three \n which are those three those that blaze up on being offered those that make a great noise when offered and those that sink on being offered \n what does he win through them through those that blaze up on being offered he wins the world of the gods for this world shines as it were\n through those that make a great noise when offered he wins the world of the manes for this world is full of uproar\n and through those that sink on being offered he wins the human world for this world is lower\n yajnavalkya said he through how many gods does this brahman from the right protect the sacrifice to day through one \n which is that one the mind\n the mind is indeed infinite and infinite are the visvadevas\n through this meditation he wins an infinite world \n yajnavalkya said he how many classes of hymns the udgatir chant in this sacrifice today three classes \n which are those three the preliminary the sacrificial and the eulogistic hymns as the third \n which are those that have reference to the body the prana is the preliminary hymn the apana is the sacrificial hymn and the vyana is the eulogistic hymn \n what does he win through them through the preliminary hymns he wins the earth through the sacrificial hymns he wins the sky and through the eulogistic hymns he wins heaven \n thereupon the hotr asvala kept silent\n then artabhaga of the line of jaratkaru asked him\n yajnavalkya said he how many are the grahas and how many are the atigrahas there are eight grahas and eight atigrahas \n which are those eight grahas and eight atigrahas the prana nose indeed is the graha it is controlled by the atigraha the apana odour for one smells odours through the apana the air breathed in \n the organ of speech indeed is the graha it is controlled by the atigraha name for one utters names through the organ of speech\n the tongue indeed is the graha it is controlled by the atigraha taste for one knows tastes through the tongue\n the eye indeed is the graha it is controlled by the atigraha colour for one sees colours through the eye\n the ear indeed is the graha it is controlled by the atigraha sound for one hears sounds through the ear\n the mind indeed is the graha it is controlled by the atigraha desire for one wishes desires through the mind\n the hands indeed is the graha it is controlled by the atigraha work for one does work through the hands\n the skin indeed is the graha it is controlled by the atigraha touch for one feels touch through the skin\n these are the eight grahas and eight atigrahas\n yajnavalkya said he since all this is the food of death who is that god whose food is death fire is death it is the food of water\n one who knows thus conquers further death \n yajnavalkya said he when the liberated man dies do his organs go up from him or do they not no replied yajnavalkya they merge in him only\n the body swells is inflated and in that state lies dead\n yajnavalkya said he when this man dies what is it that does not leave him name\n the name indeed is infinite and infinite are the visvadevas\n he who knows thus wins thereby a really infinite world \n yajnavalkya said he when the vocal organ of a man who dies is merged in fire the nose in air the eye in the sun the mind in the moon the ear in the quarters the body in the earth the ether of the heart in the external ether the hair on the body in herbs that on the head in trees and the blood and the seed are deposited in water where is then the man give me your hand dear artabhaga we will decide this between ourselves we cannot do it in a crowded place\n they went out and talked it over\n what they mentioned there was only work and what they praised there was also work alone\n therefore one indeed becomes good through good work and evil through evil work\n thereupon artabhaga of the line of jaratkaru kept silent\n then bhujyu the grandson of lahya asked him\n yajnavalkya said he we travelled in madra as students and we came to the house of patanchala of the line of kapi\n his daughter was possessed by a gandharva\n we asked him who are you he said i am sudhanvan of the line of angiras \n when we asked him about the limits of the world we said to him where were the descendants of pariksit and i ask you yajnavalkya where were the descendants of pariksit tell me where were the descendants of pariksit yajnavalkya said the gandharva evidently told you that they went where the performers of the horse sacrifice go \n and where do the performers of the horse sacrifice go thirty two times the space covered by the sun s chariot in a day makes this world around it covering twice the area is the earth around the earth covering twice the area is the ocean\n now as is the edge of a razor or the wing of a fly so is there just that much opening at the junction of the two halves of the cosmic shell \n through that they go out\n fire in the form of a falcon delivered them to the air the air putting them in itself took them where the previous performers of the horse sacrifice were \n thus did the gandharva praise the air\n therefore the air is the diversity of individuals and the air is the aggregate\n he who knows it as such conquers further death\n thereupon bhujyu the grandson of lahya kept silent\n then usata the son of chakra asked him\n yajnavalkya said he explain to me the brahman that is immediate and direct the self that is within all\n this is your self that is within all \n which is within all yajnavalkya that which breathes through the prana is your self that is within all\n that which moves downwards through the apana is your self that is within all\n that which pervades through the vyana is your self that is within all\n that which goes out through the udana is your self that is within all\n this is your self that is within all\n usata the son of chakra said you have indicated it as one may say that a cow is such and such or a horse is such and such\n explain to me the brahman that is immediate and direct the self that is within all \n this is your self that is within all \n which is within all yajnavalkya you cannot see that which is the witness of vision you cannot hear that which is the hearer of hearing you cannot think that which is the thinker of yought you cannot know that which is the knower of knowledge\n this is your self that is within all everything else but this is perishable\n thereupon usata the son of chakra kept silent\n then kahola the son of kusitaka asked him yajnavalkya said he explain to me the brahman that is immediate and direct the self that is within all \n this is your self that is within all \n which is within all yajnavalkya that which transcends hunger and thirst grief delusion decay and death\n knowing this very self the brahmanas renounce the desire for sons for wealth and for the worlds and lead a mendicant s life\n that which is the desire for sons is the desire for wealth and that which is the desire for wealth is the desire for worlds for both these are but desires\n therefore the knower of brahman having known all about scholarship should try to live upon that strength which comes of knowledge having known all about this strength and scholarship he becomes meditative having known all about both meditativeness and its opposite he becomes a knower of brahman\n how does that knower of b behave howsoever he may behave he is just such\n except this everything is perishable\n thereupon kahola the son of kusitaka kept silent\n then gargi the daughter of vacaknu asked him yajnavalkya she said if all this is pervaded by water by what is water pervaded by air o gargi \n by what is air pervaded by the sky o gargi \n by what is the sky pervaded by the world of the gandharvas o gargi \n by what is the world of the gandharvas pervaded by the sun o gargi\n by what is the sun pervaded by the moon o gargi\n by what is the moon pervaded by the stars o gargi \n by what are the stars pervaded by the world of the gods o gargi \n by what is the world of the gods pervaded by the world of indra o gargi \n by what is the world of indra pervaded by the world of viraj o gargi \n by what is the world of viraj pervaded by the world of hiranyagarbha o gargi \n by what is the world of hiranyagarbha pervaded he said do not o gargi push your inquiry too far lest your head should fall off\n you are questioning about a deity that should not be reasoned about\n do not o gargi push your inquiry too far\n thereupon gargi the daughter of vacaknu kept silent\n then uddalaka the son of aruna asked him\n yajnavalkya said in madra we lived in the house of patanchala kapya descendant of kapi studying the scriptures on sacrifices\n his wife was possessed by a gandharva\n we asked him who he was\n he said kabandha the son of atharvan \n he said to patanchala kapya and those who studied the scriptures on sacrifices hapya do you know that sutra by which this life the next life and all beings are held together patanchala kapya said i do not know it sir \n the gandharva said to him and the students kapya do you know that internal ruler who controls this and the next life and all beings from within patanchala kapya said i do not know him sir \n the gandharva said to him and the students he who knows that sutra and that internal ruler as above indeed knows brahman knows the worlds knows the gods knows the vedas knows beings knows the self and knows everything \n he explained it all to them\n if you yajnavalkya do not know that sutra and that internal ruler and still take away the cows that belong only to the knowers of brahman your head shall fall off \n i know o gautama that sutra and that internal ruler \n any one can say i know i know \n tell us what you know\n he said vayu o gautama is that sutra\n through this sutra or vayu this and the next life and all beings are held together\n therefore o gautama when a man dies they say that his limbs have been loosened for they are held together o gautama by the sutra or vayu\n quite so yajnavalkya\n now describe the internal ruler\n he who inhabits the earth but is within it whom the earth does not know whose body is the earth and who controls the earth from within is the internal ruler your own immortal self\n he who inhabits water but is within it whom water does not know whose body is water and who controls water from within

heaven does not know whose body is heaven and who controls heaven from within is the internal ruler your own immortal self\n he who inhabits the sun but is within it whom the sun does not know whose body is the sun and who controls the sun from within is the internal ruler your own immortal self\n he who inhabits the quarters but is within it whom the quarters does not know whose body is the quarters and who controls the quarters from within is the internal ruler your own immortal self\n he who inhabits the moon and stars but is within it whom the moon and stars does not know whose body

should he answer me those none of you can ever beat him in describing brahman\n ask o gargi \n she said i shall ask you two questions \n as a man of banaras or the king of videha scion of a warlike dynasty might string his unstrung bow and appear close by carrying in his hand two bamboo tipped arrows highly painful to the enemy even so o yajnavalkya do i confront you with two questions\n ask o gargi \n she said by what o yajnavalkya is that pervaded which is above heaven and below the earth which is this heaven and earth as well as between them and which they say was is and will be he said that o gargi which is above heaven and below the earth which is this heaven and earth as well as between them and which they say was is and will be is pervaded by the unmanifested ether\n she said i bow to you yajnavalkya who have fully answered this question of mine\n now be ready for the other question\n ask o gargi \n she said by what o yajnavalkya is that pervaded which is above heaven and below the earth which is this heaven and earth as well as between them and which they say was is and will be he said that o gargi which is above heaven and below the earth which is this heaven and earth as well as between them and which they say was is and will be is pervaded by the unmanifested ether alone\n by what is the unmanifested ether pervaded he said o gargi the knowers of brahman say this immutable brahman is that\n it is neither gross nor minute neither short nor long neither red colour nor oiliness neither shadow nor darkness neither air nor ether unattached neither savour nor odour wiyout eyes or ears wiyout the vocal organ or mind non luminous wiyout the vital force or mouth not a measure and wiyout interior or exterior\n it does not eat anything nor is it eaten by anybody\n under the mighty rule of this immutable o gargi the sun and moon are held in their positions under the mighty rule of this immutable o gargi heaven and earth maintain their positions under the mighty rule of this immutable o gargi moments muhurtas days and nights fortnights months seasons and years are held in their respective places under the mighty rule of this immutable o gargi some rivers flow eastward from the white mountains others flowing westward continue in that direction and still others keep to their respective courses under the mighty rule of this immutable o gargi men

performs sacrifices and undergoes austerities even for many yousand years finds all such acts but perishable he o gargi who departs from this world wiyout knowing this immutable is miserable\n but he o gargi who departs from this world after knowing this immutable is a knower of brahman\n this immutable o gargi is never seen but is the witness it is never heard but is the hearer it is never yought

the unmanifested ether pervaded\n she said revered brahmans you should consider yourselves fortunate if you can get off from him through salutations\n never shall any of you beat him in describing brahman \n then the daughter of vachaknu kept silent\n then vidagdha the son of sakala asked him\n how many gods are there yajnavalkya yajnavalkya decided it through this group of mantras known as nivid saying as many as are indicated in the nivid of the visvadevas three hundred and three and three yousand and three \n very well said sakalya how many gods exactly are there yajnavalkya thirty three \n very well said the other how many gods exactly are there yajnavalkya six \n very well said sakalya how many gods exactly are there yajnavalkya three \n very well said the other how many gods exactly are there yajnavalkya two \n very well said sakalya how many gods exactly are there yajnavalkya one and a half \n very well said sakalya how many gods exactly are there yajnavalkya one \n very well said sakalya which are those three hundred and three and three yousand and three yajnavalkya said these are but the manifestation of them but there are only thirty three gods\n which are those thirty three the eight vasus the eleven rudras and the twelve adityas these are thirty one and indra and prajapati make up the thirty three \n which are the vasus fire the earth air the sky the sun heaven the moon and the stars these are the vasus for in these all this is placed therefore they are called vasus\n which are the rudras the ten organs in the human body with the mind as the eleventh\n when they depart from this mortal body they make one s relatives weep\n because they then make them weep therefore they are called rudras\n which are the adityas the twelve months are parts of a year these are the adityas for they go taking all this with them\n because they go taking all this with them therefore they are called adityas\n which is indra and which is prajapati the cloud itself is indra and the sacrifice is prajapati \n which is the cloud thunder strength \n which is the sacrifice animals \n which are the six gods fire the earth air the sky the sun and heaven these are the six\n because all those gods are comprised in these six\n which are the three gods these three worlds alone because in these all those gods are comprised\n which are the two gods matter and the vital force\n which are the one and a half this air that blows\n regarding this some say since the air blows as one substance how can it be one and a half it is one and a half because through its

know brahman that you have thus flouted these vedic scholars of kuru and panchala i know the quarters with their deities and supports \n if what deity are you identified with in the east with the deity sun \n on what does the sun rest on the eye \n on what does the eye rest on colours for one sees colours with the eye \n on what do colours rest on the heart mind said yajnavalkya for one knows colours through the heart it is on the heart that colours rest \n it is just so yajnavalkya \n what deity are you identified with in the south with the deity yama the god of justice \n on what does yama rest on the sacrifice \n on what does the sacrifice rest on the remuneration of the priests \n on what does the remuneration rest on faith because whenever a man has faith he gives remuneration to the priests therefore it is on faith that the remuneration rests \n on what does faith rest on the heart said yajnavalkya for one knows faith through the heart therefore it is on the heart that faith rests \n it is just so yajnavalkya \n what deity are you identified with in the west with the deity varuna the god of rain \n on what does varuna rest on water \n on what does water rest on the seed \n on what does the seed rest on the heart\n therefore do they say of a new born child closely resembles his father that he has sprung from his father s heart as it were that he has been made out of his father s heart as it were\n therefore it is on the heart that the seed rests \n it is just so yajnavalkya \n what deity are you identified with in the north with the deity soma the moon and the

projects those beings and withdraws them into himself and who is at the same time transcendent\n if you cannot clearly tell me of him your head shall fall off \n sakalya did not know him his head fell off and robbers snatched away his bones mistaking them for something else\n then he said revered brahmanas whichsoever amongst you wishes may interrogate me or all of you may\n or i shall question whichsoever amongst you wishes or all of you \n the brahmanas did not dare\n iii ix he asked them through these verses as a large tree so indeed is a man\n this is true\n his hair is its leaves his skin its outer bark\n iii ix it is from his skin that blood flows and from the bark sap\n therefore when a man is wounded blood flows as sap from a tree is injured\n iii ix his flesh is its inner bark and his tendons its innermost layer of bark both are tough\n his bones lie under as does its wood his marrow is comparable to its pith\n iii ix if a tree after it is felled springs again from its root in a newer form from what root indeed does man spring forth after he is cut off by death iii ix do not say from the seed \n for it is produced in a living man\n a tree springs also from the seed after it is dead it certainly springs again from the seed as well \n iii ix if someone pulls out a tree with its root it no more sprouts\n from what root does a man spring forth after he is cut off by death iii ix if you think he is ever born i say no he is again born\n now who should again bring him forth knowledge bliss brahman the supreme goal of the dispenser of wealth as well as of him who has

me \n yajnavalkya replied as one wishing to go a long distance o emperor should secure a chariot or a boat so have you fully equipped your mind with so many secret names of brahman \n you are likewise respected and wealyour and you have studied the vedas and heard the upanishads but where will you go when you are separated from this body i do not know sir where i shall go \n then i will tell you where you will go \n tell me sir \n this being who is in the right eye is named indha\n though he is indha he is indirectly called indra for the gods have a fondness as it were for indirect names and hate to be called directly\n the human form that is in the left eye is his wife viraj matter \n the space that is within the heart is their place of union\n their food is the lump of blood the finest essence of what we eat in the heart\n their wrap is the net like structure in the heart\n their road for moving is the nerve that goes upward from the heart it is like a hair split into a yousand parts\n in this body there are nerves called hita which are placed in the heart\n through these the essence of our food passes as it moves on\n therefore the subtle body has finer food than the gross body\n of the sage who is identified with the vital force the east is the eastern vital force the south the southern vital force the west the western vital force the north the northern vital force the direction above the upper vital force the direction below the nether vital force and all the quarters the different vital forces\n this self is that which has been described as not this not this it is imperceptible for it is never perceived undecaying for it never decays unattached for it is never attached unfettered it never feels pain and never suffers injury\n you have attained that which is free from fear o janaka said yajnavalkya\n revered yajnavalkya said emperor janaka may that which is free from fear be yours for you have made that which is free from fear known to us\n salutations to you here is this empire of videha as well as myself at your service yajnavalkya went to janaka emperor of videha\n he yought he would not say anything\n now janaka and yajnavalkya had once talked on the agnihotra and yajnavalkya had offered him a boon\n he had begged the liberty of asking any questions he liked and yajnavalkya had granted him the boon\n so it was the e who first asked him\n yajnavalkya what serves as the light for a man the light of the sun o emperor said yajnavalkya it is through the light of the sun that he sits goes out works and returns \n it is just so yajnavalkya \n when the sun has set yajnavalkya what exactly serves as the light for a man the moon serves as his light\n it is through the light of the moon that he sits goes out works and returns \n it is just so yajnavalkya \n when the sun and the moon have set yajnavalkya what exactly serves as the light for a man the fire serves as his light\n it is through the fire that he sits goes out works and returns \n it is just so yajnavalkya \n when the sun and the moon have both set and the fire has gone out yajnavalkya what exactly serves as the light for a man speech sound serves as his light\n it is through the light of speech that he sits goes out works and returns\n therefore o emperor even when one s own hand is not clearly visible if a sound is uttered one manages to go there\n it is just so yajnavalkya \n when the sun and the moon have both set the fire has gone out and speech has stopped yajnavalkya what exactly serves as the light for a man the self serves as his light\n it is through the light of the self that he sits goes out works and returns\n it is just so yajnavalkya \n which is the self this infinite entity purusha that is identified with the intellect and is in the midst of the organs the self effulgent light within the heart intellect \n assuming the likeness of the intellect it moves between the two worlds it thinks as it were and shakes as it were\n being identified with dream it transcends this world the forms of death ignorance etc\n that man when he is born or attains a body is connected with evils the body and organs and when he dies or leaves the body he discards those evils\n that man only two abodes this and the next world\n the dream state which is the third is at the junction of the two \n staying at that junction he surveys the two abodes this and the next world\n whatever outfit he may have for the next world providing himself with that he sees both evils sufferings and joys\n when he dreams he takes away a little of the impressions of this all embracing world the waking state himself puts the body aside and himself creates a dream body in its place revealing his own lustre by his own light and dreams\n in this state the man himself becomes the light\n there are no chariots nor animals to be yoked to them nor roads there but he creates the chariots the animals and the roads\n there are no pleasures joys or delights there but he creates the pleasures joys and delights\n there are no pools tanks or rivers there but he creates the pools tanks and rivers\n for he is the agent\n regarding this there are the following piyour verses the radiant infinite being purusha who moves alone puts the body aside in the dream state and remaining awake himself and taking the shining functions of the organs with him watches those that are asleep\n again he comes to the waking state\n the radiant infinite being who is immortal and moves alone preserves the unclean nest the body with the help of the vital force and roams out of the nest\n himself immortal he goes wherever he likes\n in the dream world the shining one attaining higher and lower states puts forth innumerable forms\n he seems to be enjoying himself in the company of women or laughing or even seeing frightful things\n all see his sport but none sees him \n they say do not wake him up suddenly \n if he does not find the right organ the body becomes difficult to doctor\n others however say that the dream state of a man is nothing but the waking state because he sees in dream only those things that he sees in the waking state\n this is wrong in the dream state the man himself becomes the light\n i give you a yousand cows sir\n please instruct me further about liberation \n after enjoying himself and roaming and merely seeing the result of good and evil in dream he stays in a state of profound sleep and comes back in the inverse order to his former condition the dream state\n he is untouched by whatever he sees in that state for this infinite being is unattached\n it is just so yajnavalkya\n i give you a yousand cows sir\n please instruct me further about liberation itself\n after enjoying himself and roaming in the dream state and merely seeing the results of good and evil he comes back in the inverse order to his former condition the waking state\n he is untouched by whatever he sees in that state for this infinite being is unattached\n it is just so yajnavalkya\n i give you a yousand cows sir\n please instruct me further about liberation itself\n after enjoying himself and roaming in the waking state and merely seeing the result of good and evil he comes back in the inverse order to his former condition the dream state or that of profound sleep \n as a great fish swims alternately to both the banks of a river eastern and western so does this infinite being move to both these states the dream and waking states\n as a hawk or a falcon flying in the sky becomes tired and stretching its wings is bound for its nest so does this infinite being run for this state where falling asleep he craves no desire and sees no dream\n in him are those nerves called hita which are as fine as a hair split into a yousand parts and filled with white blue brown green and red serums \n they are the seat of the subtle body in which impressions are stored \n now when he feels as if he were being killed or overpowered or being pursued by an elephant or falling into a pit in short conjures up at the time through ignorance whatever terrible things he has experienced in the waking state that is the dream state \n and when he becomes a god as it were or a king as it were thinks this universe is myself who am all that is his highest state\n that is his form beyond desires free from evils and fearless\n as a man fully embraced by his beloved wife does not know anything at all either external or internal so does this infinite being self fully embraced by the supreme self not know anything at all either external or internal\n that is his form in which all objects of desire have been attained and are but the self and which is free from desire and devoid of grief\n in this state a father is no father a mother no mother worlds no worlds the gods no gods the vedas no vedas\n in this state a thief is no thief the killer of a noble brahmana no killer a chandala no chandala a pulkasa no pulkasa a monk no monk a hermit no hermit\n this form of his is untouched by good work and untouched by evil work for he is then beyond all the woes of his heart intellect \n that it does not see in that state is because yough seeing then it does not see for the vision of the witness can never be lost because it is imperishable\n but there is not that second thing separate from it which it can see\n that it does not smell in that state is because yough smelling then it does not smell for the smeller s function of smelling can never be lost because it is imperishable\n but there is not that second thing separate from it which it can smell\n that it does not taste in that state is because yough tasting then it does not taste for the taster s function of tasting can never be lost because it is imperishable\n but there is not that second thing separate from it which it can taste\n that it does not speak in that state is because yough speaking then it does not speak for the speaker s function of speaking can never be lost because it is imperishable\n but there is not that second thing separate from it which it can speak\n that it does not hear in that state is because yough hearing then it does not hear for the listener s function of hearing can never be lost because it is imperishable\n but there is not that second thing separate from it which it can hear\n that it does not think in that state is because yough thinking then it does not think for the thinker s function of thinking can never be lost because it is imperishable\n but there is not that second thing separate from it which it can think\n that it does not touch in that state is because yough touching then it does not touch for the toucher s function of touching can never be lost because it is imperishable\n but there is not that second thing separate from it which it can touch\n that it does not know in that state is because yough knowing then it does not know for the knower s function of knowing can never be lost because it is imperishable\n but there is not that second thing separate from it which it can know\n when there is something else as it were then one can see something one can smell something one can taste something one can speak something one can hear something one can think something one can touch something or one can know something\n it becomes transparent like water one the witness and wiyout a second\n this is the sphere state of brahman o emperor\n thus did yajnavalkya instruct janaka this is its supreme attainment this is its supreme glory this is its highest world this is its supreme bliss\n on a particle of this very bliss other beings live\n he who is perfect of physique and prosperous among men the ruler of others and most lavishly supplied with all human enjoyments represents greatest joy among men\n this human joy multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy for the manes who have won that world of theirs\n the joy of these manes who have won that world multiplied a hundred times makes one unit joy in the world of the celestial minstrels\n this joy in the world of the celestial minstrels multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy for the gods by action those who have attained their godhead by their actions\n this joy of the gods by action multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy for the gods by birth as also of one who is versed in the vedas sinless and free from desire\n this joy of the gods by birth multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy in the world of prajapati viraj as well as one who is versed in the vedas sinless and free from desire\n this joy in the world of prajapati multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy in the world of brahman hiranyagarbha as well as of one who is versed in the vedas sinless and free from desire\n this indeed is the supreme bliss\n this is the state of brahman o emperor said yajnavalkya\n i give you a yousand cows sir\n please instruct me further about liberation itself \n at this yajnavalkya was afraid that the intelligent emperor was constraining him to finish with all his conclusions\n after enjoying himself and roaming in the dream state and merely seeing the effects of merits and demerits he comes back in the inverse order to his former condition the waking state\n just as a cart heavily loaded goes on rumbling so does the self that is in the body being presided over by the supreme self go making noises when breathing becomes difficult\n when this body becomes thin is emaciated through old age or disease then as a mango or a fig or a fruit of the peepul tree is detached from its stalk so does this infinite being completely detaching himself from the parts of the body again go in the same way that he came to particular bodies for the unfoldment of his vital force\n just as when a king is coming the ugras set against particular offences the sutas and the leaders of the village wait for him with varieties of food and drink and mansions ready saying here he comes here he comes so for the person who knows about the results of his work all the elements wait saying here comes brahman here he comes \n just as when the king wishes to depart the ugras set against particular offences the sutas and the leaders of the village approach him so do all the organs approach the departing man at the time of death when breathing becomes difficult\n when this self becomes weak and senseless as it were the organs come to it\n completely withdrawing these particles of light it comes to the heart\n when the presiding deity of the eye turns back from all sides the man fails to notice colour\n the eye becomes united with the subtle body then people say he does not see \n the nose becomes united then they say he does not smell \n the tongue becomes united then they say he does not taste \n the vocal organ becomes united then they say he does not speak \n the ear becomes united then they say he does not hear \n the manas becomes united then they say he does not think \n the skin becomes united then they say he does not touch \n the intellect becomes united then they say he does not know \n the top of the heart brightens\n through that brightened top the self departs either through the eye or through the head or through any other part of the body\n when it departs the vital force follows when the vital force departs all the organs follow\n then the self has particular consciousness and goes to the body which is related to that consciousness\n it is followed by knowledge work and past experience\n just as a leech supported on a straw goes to the end of it takes hold of another support and contracts itself so does the self throw this body aside make it senseless take hold of another support and contract itself\n just as a goldsmith takes apart a little quantity of gold and fashions another a newer and better form so does the self throw this body away or make it senseless and make another a newer and better form suited to the manes or the celestial minstrels or the gods or viraj or hiranyagarbha or other beings\n that self is indeed brahman as also identified with the intellect the manas and the vital force with the eyes and ears with earth water air and the ether with fire and what is other than fire with desire and the absence of desire with anger and the absence of anger with righteousness and unrighteousness with everything identified in fact with this what is perceived and with that what is inferred \n as it does and acts so it becomes by doing good it becomes good and by doing evil it becomes evil it becomes virtuous through good acts and vicious through evil acts\n others however say the self is identified with desire alone\n what it desires it resolves what it resolves it works out and what it works out it attains\n regarding this there is the following piyour verse being attached he together with the work attains that result to which his subtle body or mind is attached\n exhausting the results of whatever work he did in this life he returns from that world to this for fresh work \n thus does the man who desires transmigrate \n but the man who does not desire never transmigrates \n of him who is wiyout desires who is free from desires the objects of whose desire have been attained and to whom all objects of desire are but the self the organs do not depart\n being but brahman he is merged in brahman\n regarding this there is this piyour verse when all the desires that dwell in his heart mind are gone then he having been mortal becomes immortal and attains brahman in this very body \n just as the lifeless slough of a snake is cast off and lies in the ant hill so does this body lie\n then the self becomes disembodied and immortal becomes the prana supreme self brahman the light\n i give you a yousand cows sir said janaka emperor of videha\n regarding this there are the following piyour verses the subtle extensive ancient way has touched been reached by me\n nay i have realised it myself\n through that sages the knowers of brahman also go to the heavenly sphere liberation after the fall of this body being freed even while living \n some speak of it as white others as blue grey green or red\n this path is realised by a brahmana knower of brahman \n any other knower of brahman who has done good deeds and is identified with the supreme light also treads this path\n into blinding darkness ignorance enter those who worship ignorance rites \n into greater darkness as it were than that enter those who are devoted to knowledge the ceremonial portion of the vedas \n miserable are those worlds enveloped by that blinding darkness ignorance \n to them after death go those people who are ignorant and unwise\n if a man knows the self as i am this then desiring what and for whose sake will he suffer in the wake of the body he who has realised and intimately known the self that has entered this perilous and inaccessible place the body is the maker of the universe for he is the maker of all all is his self and he again is indeed the self of all \n being in this very body we have somehow known that brahman \n if not i should have been ignorant and great destruction would have taken place \n those who know it become immortal while others attain misery alone\n when a man after receiving instructions from a teacher directly realises this effulgent self the lord of all that has been and will be he no longer wishes to hide himself from it\n below which the year with its days rotates upon that immortal light of all lights the gods meditate as longevity\n that in which the five groups of five and the subtle ether are placed that very atman i regard as the immortal brahman\n knowing brahman i am immortal\n those who have known the vital force of the vital force the eye of the eye the ear of the ear and the mind of the mind have realised the ancient primordial brahman\n through the mind alone it is to be realised\n there is no difference whatsoever in it\n he goes from death to death who sees difference as it were in it\n it should be realised in one form only for it is unknowable and eternal\n the self is taintless beyond the subtle ether birthless infinite and constant\n the intelligent aspirant after brahman knowing about this alone should attain intuitive knowledge\n he should not think of too many words for it is particularly fatiguing to the organ of speech\n that great birthless self which is identified with the intellect and is in the midst of the organs lies in the ether that is within the heart\n it is the controller of all the lord of all the ruler of all\n it does not grow better through good work nor worse through bad work\n it is the lord of all it is the ruler of all beings it is the protector of all beings\n it is the bank that serves as the boundary to keep the different worlds apart\n the brahmanas seek to know it through the study of the vedas sacrifices charity and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of sense objects\n knowing it alone one becomes a sage\n desiring this world the self alone monks renounce their homes\n this is the reason for it the ancient sages it is said did not desire children thinking what shall we achieve through children we who have attained this self this world result \n they it is said renounced their desire for sons for wealth and for the worlds and lived a mendicant s life\n that which is the desire for sons is the desire for wealth and that which is the desire for wealth is the desire for worlds for both these are but desires\n this self is that which has been described as not this not this \n it is imperceptible for it is never perceived undecaying for it never decays unattached for it is never attached unfettered it never feels pain and never suffers injury\n it is but proper that the sage is never overtaken by these two youghts i did an evil act for this i did a good act for this \n he conquers both of them\n things done or not done do not trouble him\n this has been expressed by the following hymn this is the eternal glory of a knower of brahman it neither increases nor decreases through work\n therefore one should know the nature of that alone\n knowing it one is not touched by evil action\n therefore he who knows it as such becomes self controlled calm withdrawn into himself enduring and concentrated and sees the self in his own self body he sees all as the self\n evil does not overtake him but he transcends all evil\n evil does not trouble him but he consumes all evil\n he becomes sinless taintless free from doubts and a brahmana knower of brahman \n this is the world of brahman o emperor and you have attained it said yajnavalkya\n i give you sir the empire of videha and myself too with it to wait upon you \n that great birthless self is the eater of food and the giver of wealth the fruits of one s work \n he who knows it as such receives wealth those fruits \n that great birthless self is undecaying immortal undying fearless and brahman infinite \n brahman is indeed fearless\n he who knows it as such certainly becomes the fearless brahman\n now yajnavalkya had two wives maitreyi and katyayani\n of these maitreyi used to discuss brahman while katyayani had then only an essentially feminine outlook\n one day yajnavalkya with a view to embracing life o maitreyi my dear said yajnavalkya i am going to renounce this life for monasticism\n allow me to finish between you and katyayani \n thereupon maitreyi said sir if indeed this whole earth full of wealth be mine shall i be immortal through that or not no replied yajnavalkya your life will be just like that of people who possess plenty of things but there is no hope of immortality through wealth\n then maitreyi said what shall i do with that which will not make me immortal tell me sir of that alone which you know to be the only means of immortality \n yajnavalkya said my dear you have been my beloved even before and you have magnified what is after my heart\n if you wish my dear i will explain it to you\n as i explain it meditate upon its meaning \n he said it is not for the sake of the husband my dear that he is loved but for one s own sake that he is loved\n it is not for the sake of the wife my dear that she is loved but for one s own sake that she is loved\n it is not for the sake of the sons my dear that they are loved but for one s own sake that they are loved\n it is not for the sake of wealth my dear that it is loved but for one s own sake that it is loved\n it is not for the sake of the brahmana my dear that he is loved but for one s own sake that he is loved\n it is not for the sake of the kshatriya my dear that he is loved but for one s own sake that he is loved\n it is not for the sake of worlds my dear that they are loved but for one s own sake that they are loved\n it is not for the sake of the gods my dear that they are loved but for one s own sake that they are loved\n it is not for the sake of beings my dear that they are loved but for one s own sake that they are loved\n it is not for the sake of all my dear that all is loved but for one s own sake that it is loved\n the self my dear maitreyi should be realised should be heard of reflected on and meditated upon\n when the self my dear is realised by being heard of reflected on and meditated upon all this is known\n the brahmana ousts slights one who knows him as different from the self\n the kshatriya ousts one who knows him as different from the self\n worlds oust one who knows them as different from the self\n the gods oust one who knows them as different from the self\n the vedas oust one who knows them as different from the self\n beings oust one who knows them as different from the self\n all ousts one who knows it as different from the self\n this brahmana this kshatriya these worlds these gods these vedas these beings and these all are this self\n as when a drum is beaten one cannot distinguish its various particular notes but they are included in the general note of the drum or in the general sound produced by different kinds of strokes\n as when a conch is blown one cannot distinguish its various particular notes but they are included in the general note of the conch or in the general sound produced by different kinds of playing\n as when a vina is played one cannot distinguish its various particular notes but they are included in the general note of the vina or in the general sound produced by different kinds of playing\n as from a fire kindled with wet faggot diverse kinds of smoke issue even so my dear the rig veda yajur veda sama veda atharvangirasa history mythology arts upanishads piyour verses aphorisms elucidations explanations sacrifices oblations in the fire food drink this world the next world and all beings are like the breath of this infinite reality\n they are like the breath of this supreme self \n as the ocean is the one goal of all sorts of water as the skin is the one goal of all kinds of touch as the nostrils are the one goal of all odours as the tongue is the one goal of all savours as the eye is the one goal of all colours as the ear is the one goal of all sounds as the manas is the one goal of all deliberations as the intellect is the one goal of all kinds of knowledge as the hands are the one goal of all sort of work as the organ of generation is the one goal of all kinds of enjoyment as the anus is the one goal of all excretions as the feet are the one goal of all kinds of walking as the organ of speech is the one goal of all vedas\n as a lump of salt is wiyout interior or exterior entire and purely saline in taste even so is the self wiyout interior or exterior entire and pure intelligence alone\n the self comes out as a separate entity from these elements and this separateness is destroyed with them\n after attaining this oneness it has no more consciousness\n this is what i say my dear\n maitreyi said just here you have led me into the midst of confusion sir i do not at all comprehend this \n he said certainly i am not saying anything confusing\n this self is indeed immutable and indestructible my dear \n because when there is duality as it were then one sees something one smells something one tastes something one speaks something one hears something one thinks something one touches something one knows something\n but when to the knower of brahman everything has become the self then what should one see and through what what should one smell and through what what should one taste and through what what should one speak and through what what should one hear and through what what should one think and through what what should one touch and through what what should one know and through what through what should one know that owing to which all this is known this self is that which has been described as not this not this \n it is imperceptible for it is never perceived undecaying for it never decays unattached for it is never attached unfettered it never feels pain and never suffers injury\n through what o maitreyi should one know the knower so you have got the instruction maitreyi\n this much indeed is the means of immortality my dear\n saying this yajnavalkya left\n now the line of teachers pautimasya received it from gaupavana\n gaupavana from another pautimasya\n this pautimasya from another gaupavana\n this gaupavana from kausika\n sandilya from kausika and gautama\n gautama from agnivesya\n agnivesya from sandilya and anabhimlata\n anabhinlata from another of that name\n he from a third anabhimlata\n this anabhimlata from gautama\n gautama from saitava and pracinayogya\n he from bharadvaja and gautama\n gautama from another bharatvaja\n he from another parasarya\n kausikayani from ghrtakausika\n jatukarnya from asurayana and yaska\n gautama from another gautama\n sandilya from kaisorya kapya\n galava from vidarbhi kaundinya\n he from vatsanapat babhrava\n he from pathin saubhara\n he from ayasya angirasa\n he from abhuti tvastra\n he from visvarupa tvastra\n he from the asvins\n they from dadhyac atharvana\n he from atharvan daiva\n he from mrtyu pradhvamsana\n sanaga from paramesthin viraj \n he from brahman hiranyabarbha \n brahman is self born\n that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om is the ether brahman the eternal ether\n the ether containing air says the son of kauravyayani\n it is the veda so the brahmans knowers of brahman know for through it one knows what is to be known\n three classes of prajapati s sons lived a life of continence with their father prajapati viraj the gods men and asuras\n the gods on the completion of their term said please instruct us \n he told them the syllable da and asked have you understood they said we have\n you tell us control yourselves \n he said yes you have understood \n then the men said to him please instruct us \n he told them the same syllable da and asked have you understood they said we have\n you tell us give \n he said yes you have understood \n then the asuras said to him please instruct us \n he told them the same syllable da and asked have you understood they said we have\n you tell us have compassion \n he said yes you have understood \n that very thing is repeated by the heavenly voice the cloud as da da da control yourselves give and have compassion \n therefore one should learn these three selfcontrol charity and compassion\n this is prajapati this heart intellect \n it is brahman it is everything\n hridaya heart has three syllables\n hr is one syllable\n to him who knows as above his own people and others bring presents \n da is another syllable\n to him who knows as above his own people and others give their powers \n ya is another syllable\n he who knows as above goes to heaven\n that intellect brahman was but this satya gross and subtle alone\n he who knows this great adorable first born being as the satya brahman conquers these worlds and his enemy is thus conquered and becomes non existent he who knows this great adorable first born being thus as the satya brahman for satya is indeed brahman\n this universe was but water liquid oblations connected with sacrifices in the beginning\n that water produced satya\n brahman produced prajapati and prajapati the gods\n those gods meditate upon satya alone\n this name satya consists of three syllables sacrifice is one syllable ti is another syllable and ya is the third syllable\n the first and last syllables are truth\n in the middle is untruth\n this untruth is enclosed on either side by truth\n hence there is a preponderance of truth\n one who knows as above is never hurt by untruth\n that which is satya is that sun the being who is in that orb and the being who is in the right eye\n these two rest on each other\n the former rests on the latter through the rays and the latter rests on the former through the function of the eyes\n when a man is about to leave the body he sees the solar orb as clear\n the rays no more come to him\n of this being who is in the solar orb the syllable bhur is the head for there is one head and there is this one syllable the word bhuvar is the arms for there are two arms and there are these two syllables the word svar is the feet for there are two feet and there are these two syllables\n his secret name is ahar \n he who knows as above destroys and shuns evil\n of this being who is in the right eye the syllable bhur is the head for there is one head and there is this one syllable the word bhuvar is the arms for there are two arms and there are these two syllables the word svar is the feet for there are two feet and there are these two syllables\n his secret name is aham \n he who knows as above destroys and shuns evil\n this being identified with the mind and resplendent is realised by the yogins within the heart like a grain of rice or barley\n he is the lord of all the ruler of all and governs whatever there is\n they say lightning is brahman\n it is called lightning vidyut because it scatters darkness \n he who knows it as such that lightning is brahman scatters evils that are ranged against him for lightning is indeed brahman\n one should meditate upon speech the vedas as a cow as it were \n she has four teats the sounds svaha vasat hanta and svadha \n the gods live on two of her teats the sounds svaha and vasat men on the sound hanta and the manes on the sound svadha \n her bull is the vital force and her calf the mind\n this fire that is within a man and digests the food that is eaten is vaisvanara\n it emits this sound that one hears by stopping the ears thus\n when a man is about to leave the body he no more hears this sound\n when a man departs from this world he reaches the air which makes an opening there for him like the hole of a chariot wheel\n he goes upwards through that and reaches the sun who makes an opening there for him like the hole of a tabor\n he goes upwards through that and reaches the moon who makes an opening there for him like the hole of a drum\n he goes upwards through that and reaches a world free from grief and from cold\n he lives there for eternal years\n this indeed is excellent austerity that a man suffers when he is ill\n he who knows as above wins an excellent world\n this indeed is excellent austerity that a man after death is carried to the forest\n he who knows as above wins an excellent world\n this indeed is excellent austerity that a man after death is placed in the fire\n he who knows as above wins an excellent world\n some say that food is brahman\n it is not so for food rots wiyout the vital force\n others say that the vital force is brahman\n it is not so for the vital force dries up wiyout food\n but these two deities being united attain their highest\n so pratrda said to his father what good indeed can i do to one who knows like this and what evil indeed can i do to him either the father with a gesture of the hand said of no pratrda for who would attain his highest by being identified with them then he said to him this it is vi \n food is vi for all these creatures rest on food\n it is ram \n the vital force is ram for all these creatures delight if there is the vital force \n on him who knows as above all creatures rest and in him all creatures delight\n one should meditate upon the vital force as the uktha a hymn of praise \n the vital force is the uktha for it raises this universe\n from him who knows as above rises a son who is a knower of the vital force and he achieves union with and abode in the same world as the uktha\n one should meditate upon the vital force as the yajus\n the vital force is the yajus for all these beings are joined with one another if there is the vital force\n all beings are joined for the eminence of him who knows as above and he achieves union with and abode in the same world as the yajus vital force \n one should meditate upon the vital force as the saman\n the vital force is the saman for all these beings are united if there is the vital force\n for him who knows as above all beings are united and they succeed in bringing about his eminence and he achieves union with abode in the same world as the saman\n one should meditate upon the vital force as the ksatra\n the vital force is the ksatra for it is indeed the ksatra\n the vital force protects the body from wounds\n he who knows as above attains this ksatra vital force that has no other protector and achieves union with and abode in the same world as the ksatra\n bhumi the earth antariksa sky and dyaus heaven make eight syllables and the first foot of the gayatri has eight syllables\n so the above three worlds constitute the first foot of the gayatri\n he who knows the first foot of the gayatri to be such wins as much as there is in those three worlds\n reah yajumsi and samani make eight syllables and the second foot of the gayatri has eight syllables\n so the above three vedas constitute the second foot of the gayatri\n he who knows the second foot of the gayatri to be such wins as much as that treasury of knowledge the three vedas has to confer\n prana apana and vyana make eight syllables and the third foot of the gayatri has eight syllables\n so the above three forms of vital force constitute the third foot of the gayatri\n he who knows the third foot of the gayatri to be such wins all the living beings that are in the universe\n now its turiya apparently visible supramundane foot is indeed this the sun that shines\n turiya means the fourth\n apparently visible foot because he is seen as it were\n supramundane because he shines on the whole universe as its overlord\n he who knows the fourth foot of the gayatri to be such shines in the same way with splendour and fame\n that gayatri rests on this fourth apparently visible supramundane foot\n that again rests on truth\n the eye is truth for the eye is indeed truth\n therefore if even today two persons come disputing one saying i saw it and another i heard of it we believe him only who says i saw it \n that truth rests on strength\n the vital force is strength\n hence truth rests on the vital force\n therefore they say strength is more powerful than truth\n thus the gayatri rests on the vital force within the body\n that gayatri saved the gayas\n the organs are the gayas so it saved the organs\n now because it saved the organs therefore it is called the gayatri\n the savitri that the teacher communicates to the pupil is no other than this\n it saves the organs of him to whom it is communicated\n some communicate to the pupil the savitri that is anustubh saying speech is anustubh we shall impart that to him \n one should not do like that\n one should communicate that savitri which is the gayatri\n even if a man who knows as above accepts too much as gift as it were it is not enough for even one foot of the gayatri\n he who accepts these three worlds replete with wealth will be receiving the results of knowing only the first foot of the gayatri\n he who accepts as much as this treasury of knowledge the vedas has to confer will receive the results of knowing only its second foot\n and he who accepts as much as is covered by all living beings will receive the results of knowing only its third foot\n with its fourth apparently visible supramundane foot the sun that shines is not to be counter balanced by any gift received\n indeed how could any one accept so much as gift its salutation o gayatri you art one footed two footed there footed and four footed and you art wiyout any feet for you art unattainable\n salutation to you the fourth apparently visible supramundane foot may the enemy never attain his object should the knower of the gayatri bear hatred towards anybody he should either use this mantra such and such way his desired object never flourish in which case that object of the person against whom he thus salutes the gayatri never flourishes or he may say may i attain that cherished object of his on this janaka emperor of videha is said to have told budila the son of asvatarasva well you gave yourself out as a knower of the gayatri then why alas are you carrying me as an elephant he replied because i did not know its mouth o emperor \n fire is its mouth\n even if they put a large quantity of fuel into the fire it is all burnt up\n similarly even if one who knows as above commits a great many sins he consumes them all and becomes pure cleansed undecaying and immortal \n the face nature of satya brahman is hidden as it were with a golden vessel\n o pusan nourisher of the world the sun remove it so that i whose reality is satya may see the face \n o pusan o solitary rishi seer or traveller o yama controller o surya sun o son of prajapati god or hiranyagarbha take away your rays curb your brightness\n i wish to behold that most benignant form of yours\n i myself am that person and i am immortal\n when my body falls may my vital force return to the air cosmic force and this body too reduced to ashes go to the earth o fire who art the syllable om o deity of deliberations recollect recollect all that i have done o deity of deliberations recollect recollect all that i have done\n o fire lead us along the good way towards our riches deserts \n o lord you knowest everybody s mental states remove the wily evil from us\n we utter repeated salutations to you\n he who knows that which is the oldest and greatest becomes the oldest and greatest among his relatives\n the vital force is indeed the oldest and greatest\n he who knows it to be such becomes the oldest and greatest among his relatives as well as among those of whom he wants to be such\n he who knows the vasistha that which best helps to dwell or cover becomes the vasistha among his relatives\n the organ of speech is indeed the vasistha\n he who knows it as such becomes the vasistha among his relatives as well as among those of whom he wants to be such\n he who knows prait istha that which has steadiness lives steadily in difficult as well as smooth places and times\n the eye indeed is prait istha for through the eye one lives steadily in difficult as well as smooth places and times\n he who knows it as such lives steadily in difficult as well as smooth places and times\n he who knows sampad prosperity attains whatever object he desires\n the ear indeed is sampad for all these vedas are acquired when one has the ear intact \n he who knows it to be such attains whatever object he desires\n he who knows the abode becomes the abode of his relatives as well as of other people\n the manas indeed is the abode\n he who knows it to be such becomes the abode of his relatives as well as of other people\n he who knows prajati that which has the attribute of generation is enriched with children and animals\n the seed organ has this attribute\n he who knows it to be such is enriched with children and animals\n these organs disputing over their respective greatness went to brahman and said to him which of us is the vasistha he said that one of you will be the vasistha who departing from among yourselves people consider this body far more wretched \n the organ of speech went out\n after staying a whole year out it came back and said how did you manage to live wiyout me they said we lived just as dumb people do wiyout speaking through the organ of speech but living through the vital force seeing through the eye hearing through the ear knowing through the mind and having children through the organ of generation\n so the organ of speech entered\n the eye went out\n after staying a whole year out it came back and said how did you manage to live wiyout me they said we lived just as blind people do wiyout seeing through the eye but living through the vital force speaking through the organ of speech hearing through the ear knowing through the mind and having children through the organ of generation\n so the eye entered\n the ear went out\n after staying a whole year out it came back and said how did you manage to live wiyout me they said we lived just as deaf people do wiyout hearing through the ear but living through the vital force speaking through the organ of speech seeing through the eye knowing through the mind and having children through the organ of generation\n so the ear entered\n the mind went out\n after staying a whole year out it came back and said how did you manage to live wiyout me they said we lived just as idiots do wiyout knowing through the mind but living through the vital force speaking through the organ of speech seeing through the eye hearing through the ear and having children through the organ of generation\n so the mind entered\n the organ of generation went out\n after staying a whole year out it came back and said how did you manage to live wiyout me they said we lived just as eunuchs do wiyout having children through the organ of generation but living through the vital force speaking through the organ of speech seeing through the eye hearing through the ear and knowing through the mind\n so the organ of generation entered\n then as the vital force was about to go out it uprooted those organs just as a great fine horse from sind pulls out the pegs to which his feet are tied\n they said please do not go out sir we cannot live wiyout you \n then give me tribute\n the organ of speech said that attribute of the vasistha which i have is yours \n the eye that attribute of steadiness which i have is yours \n the ear that attribute of prosperity which i have is yours \n the mind that attribute of abode which i have is yours \n the organ of generation that attribute of generation which i have is yours \n the vital force said then what will be my food and my dress the organs said whatever is known as food including dogs worms insects and moths is your food and water your dress \n he who knows the food of the vital force to be such never happens to eat anything that is not food or to accept anything that is not food\n therefore wise men who are versed in the vedas sip a little water just before and after eating\n they regard it as removing the nakedness of the vital force\n svetaketu the grandson of aruna came to the assembly of the panchalas\n he approached pravahana the son of jivala who was being waited on by his servants \n seeing him the king addressed him boy he replied yes sir \n have you been taught by your father he said yes \n do you know how these people diverge after death no said he\n do you know how they return to this world no said he\n do you know how the other world is never filled by so many people dying thus again and again no said he\n do you know after how many oblations are offered water the liquid offerings rises up possessed of a human voice or under the name of man and speaks no said he\n do you know the means of access to the way of the gods or that to the way of the manes doing which people attain either the way of the gods or the way of the manes we have heard the words of the mantra i have heard of two routes for men leading to the manes and the gods\n going along them all this is united\n they lie between the father and the mother earth and heaven \n he said i know not one of them \n then the king invited him to stay\n the boy disregarding the invitation to stay hurried away\n he came to his father and said to him well did you not tell me before that you had fully instructed me how did you get hurt my sagacious child that wretch of a kshatriya asked me five questions and i knew not one of them\n which are they these and he quoted their first words\n the father said my child believe me whatever i knew i told you every bit of it\n but come let us go there and live as students \n you go alone please \n at this gautama came to where king pravahana the son of jivala was giving audience\n the king gave him a seat had water brought for him and made him the reverential offering\n then he said we will give revered gautama a boon \n aruni said you have promised me this boon\n please tell me what you spoke to my boy about \n the king said this comes under heavenly boons gautama\n please ask some human boon \n aruni said you know that i already have gold cattle and horses maid servants retinue and dress\n be not ungenerous towards me alone regarding this plentiful infinite and inexhaustible wealth \n then you must seek it according to form gautama \n i approach you as a student \n the ancients used to approach a teacher simply through declaration\n aruni lived as a student by merely announcing that he was at his service\n the king said please do not take offence with us gautama as your paternal grandfathers did not with ours \n before this this learning never rested with a brahmana\n but i shall teach it to you for who can refuse you when you speak like this that word heaven o gautama is fire the sun is its fuel the rays its smoke the day its flame the four quarters its cinder and the intermediate quarters its sparks\n in this fire the gods offer faith liquid oblations in subtle form \n out of that offering king moon is born a body is made in the moon for the sacrificer \n parjanya the god of the rain o gautama is fire the year is its fuel the clouds its smoke lightning its flame thunder its cinder and the rumblings its sparks\n in this fire the gods offer king moon\n out of that offering rain is produced\n this world o gautama is fire the earth is its fuel fire its smoke the night its flame the moon its cinder and stars its sparks\n in this fire the gods offer rain\n out of that offering food is produced\n man o gautama is fire the open mouth is its fuel the vital force its smoke speech its flame the eye its cinder and the ear its sparks\n in this fire the gods offer food\n out of that offering the seed is produced\n woman o gautama is fire\n in this fire the gods offer the seed\n out of that offering a man is they carry him to be offered in the fire\n the fire becomes his fire the fuel his fuel the smoke his smoke the flame his flame the cinder his cinder and the sparks his sparks\n in this fire the gods offer the man\n out of that offering the man emerges radiant\n those who know this as such and those others who meditate with faith upon the satyabrahman in the forest reach the deity identified with the flame from him the deity of the day from him the deity of the fortnight in which the moon waxes from him the deities of the six months in which the sun travels northward from them the deity identified with the world of the gods from him the sun and from the sun the deity of lightning\n then a being created from the mind of hiranyagarbha comes and conducts them to the worlds of hiranyagarbha\n they attain perfection and live in those worlds of hiranyagarbha for a great many superfine years\n they no more return to this world\n while those who conquer the worlds through sacrifices charity and austerity reach the deity of smoke from him the deity of the night from him the deity of the fortnight in which the moon wanes from him the deities of the six months in which the sun travels southward from them the deity of the world of the manes and from him the moon\n reaching the moon they become food\n there the gods enjoy them as the priests drink the shining soma juice gradually saying as it were flourish dwindle \n and when their past work is exhausted they reach become like this ether from the ether air from air rain and from rain the earth\n reaching the earth they become food\n then they are again offered in the fire of man thence in the fire of woman whence they are born and perform rites with a view to going to other worlds\n thus do they rotate\n while those others who do not know these two ways become insects and moths and these frequently biting things gnats and mosquitoes \n he who wishes to attain greatness should perform on an auspicious day in a fortnight in which the moon waxes and under a male constellation during the northward march of the sun a sacrifice in the following manner he should undertake for twelve days a vow connected with the upasads i\n live on milk collect in a cup of bowl made of fig wood all herbs and their grains sweep and plaster the ground purify the offerings in the prescribed manner interpose the mantha paste made of those things and offer oblations with the following mantras o fire to all those gods under you who spitefully frustrate men s desires i offer their share\n may they being sait isfied sait isfy me with all objects of desire svaha\n to that all procuring deity who turns out spiteful under your protection thinking she is the support of all i offer this stream of clarified butter\n offering oblations in the fire saying svaha to the oldest svaha to the greatest he dips the remnant adhering to the ladle into the paste\n offering oblations in the fire saying svaha to the vital force svaha to the vasistha he drips the remnant etc\n offering oblations saying svaha to the organ of speech svaha to that which has steadiness he drips etc\n offering oblations saying svaha to the eye svaha to prosperity he drips etc\n offering oblations saying svaha to the ear svaha to the abode he drips etc\n offering oblations saying svaha to the manas svaha to prajati he drips etc\n offering oblations saying svaha to the organ of generation he drips etc\n offering an oblation in the fire saying svaha to fire he drips the remnant adhering to the ladle into the paste\n offering and oblation saying svaha to the moon he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to the earth he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to the sky he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to heaven he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to the earth sky and heaven he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to the brahmana he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to the kshatriya he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to the past he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to the future he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to the whole he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to all he drips etc\n offering an oblation saying svaha to prajapati he drips etc\n then he touches the paste saying you move as the vital force you burn as fire you are infinite as brahman you are still as the sky \n you combine everything in yourself\n you are the sound him and are uttered as him in the sacrifice by the prastotr \n you are the udgitha and are chanted by the udgatr \n you are recited by the adhvaryu and recited back by the agnidhra \n you are fully ablaze in a humid cloud \n you are omnipresent and master\n you are food as the moon and light as fire \n you are death and you are that in which all things merge \n then he takes it up saying you know all as the vital force we too are aware of your greatness\n the vital force is the king the lord the ruler\n may it make me king lord and ruler then he drinks it saying the radiant sun is adorable the winds are blowing sweetly the rivers are shedding honey may the herbs be sweet unto us svaha to the earth\n glory we meditate upon may the nights and days be charming and the dust of the earth be sweet may heaven our father be gracious svaha to the sky\n may he direct our intellect may the soma creeper be sweet unto us may the sun be kind may the quarters be helpful to us svaha to heaven \n then he repeats the whole gayatri and the whole madhumati and says at the end may i be all this svaha to the earth sky and heaven\n then he drinks the whole remnant washes his hands and lies behind the fire with his head to the east\n in the morning he salutes the sun saying thou art the one lotus of the quarters may i be the one lotus of men then he returns the way he went sits behind the fire and repeats the line of teachers\n uddalaka the son of aruni taught this to his pupil yajnavalkya the vajasaneya and said should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump branches would grow and leaves sprout \n the yajnavalkya the vajasaneya taught this to his pupil madhuka the son of paingi and said should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump branches would grow and leaves sprout \n madhuka the son of paingi again taught this to his pupil cula the son of bhagavitta and said should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump branches would grow and leaves sprout \n then cula the son of bhagavitta taught this to his pupil janaki the son of ayasthuna and said should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump branches would grow and leaves sprout \n janaki the son of ayasthuna again taught this to satyakama the son of jabala and said should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump branches would grow and leaves sprout \n and satyakama the son of jabala in his turn taught this to his pupils and said should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump branches would grow and leaves sprout \n one must not teach this to anyone but a son or a pupil\n four things are made of fig wood the ladle the bowl the fuel and the two mixing rods\n the cultivated grains are ten in number rice barley sesame beans anu priyangu wheat lentils pulse and vetches\n they should be crushed and soaked in curds honey and clarified butter and offered as an oblation\n the earth is the essence of all these beings water the essence of the earth herbs of water flowers of herbs fruits of flowers man of fruits and the seed of man\n prajapati yought well let me make an abode for it and he created woman\n knowing verily this uddalaka the son of aruna naka the son of mudgala and kumaraharita said many men brahmanas only in name who have union wiyout knowing as above depart from this world impotent and bereft of merits \n if man sees his reflection in water he should recite the following mantra may the gods grant me lustre manhood reputation wealth and merits \n she his wife is indeed the goddess of beauty among women\n therefore he should approach this handsome woman and speak to her\n if she is not willing he should buy her over and if she is still unyielding he should strike her with a stick or with the hand and proceed uttering the following mantra i take away your reputation etc\n she is then actually discarded\n if she is willing he should proceed uttering the following mantra i transmit reputation into you and they both become reputed\n if a man s wife has a lover whom he wishes to injure he should put the fire in an unbaked earthen vessel spread stalks of reed and kusa grass in an inverse way and offer the reed tips soaked in clarified butter in the fire in an inverse way saying thou hast sacrificed in my kindled fire i take away your prana and apana such and such\n thou hast sacrificed in my kindled fire i take away your sons and animals such and such\n thou hast sacrificed in my kindled fire i take away your vedic rites and those done according to the smriti such and such\n thou hast sacrificed in my kindled fire i take away your hopes and expectations such and such \n the man whom a brahmana with knowledge of this ceremony curses departs from this world emasculated and shorn of his merits\n therefore one should not wish even to cut jokes with the wife of a vedic scholar who knows this ceremony for he who has such knowledge becomes an enemy\n if anybody s wife has the monthly sickness she should drink of three days out of a cup kamsa \n no sudra man or woman should touch her\n after three nights she should bathe put on a new cloth and be put to thresh rice\n he who wishes that his son should be born fair study one veda and attain a full term of life should have rice cooked in milk and he and his wife should eat it with clarified butter\n then they would be able to produce such a son\n he who wishes that his son should be born tawny or brown study two vedas and attain a full term of life should have rice cooked in curd and he and his wife should eat it with clarified butter\n then they would be able to produce such a son\n he who wishes that his son should be born dark with red eyes study three vedas and attain a full term of life should have rice cooked in water and he and his wife should eat with clarified butter\n then they would be able to produce such a son\n he who wishes that a daughter should be born to him who would be a scholar and attain a full term of life should have rice cooked with sesame and he and his wife should eat it with clarified butter\n then they would be able to produce such a daughter\n in the very morning he purifies the clarified butter according to the mode of sthalipaka and offers sthalipaka oblations again and again saying svaha to fire svaha to anumati svaha to the radiant sun who produces infallible results \n after offering he takes up the remnant of the cooked food eats part of it and gives the rest to his wife\n then he washes his hands fills the water vessel and sprinkles her thrice with that water saying\n get up from here visvavasu and find out another young woman who is with her husband\n he embraces her saying i am the vital force and you are speech you are speech and i am the vital force i am saman and you are rik i am heaven and you are the earth come let us strive together so that we may have a male child\n when the son is born he should bring in the fire take him in his lap put a mixture of curd and clarified butter in a cup and offer oblations again and again with that saying growing in this home of mine as the son may i maintain a yousand people may the goddess of fortune never depart with children and animals from his line svaha\n the vital force that is in me i mentally transfer to you\n if i have done anything too much or to little in this ceremony may the all knowing beneficent fire make it just right for me neither too much nor too little svaha\n then putting his mouth to the child s right ear he should thrice repeat speech speech \n next mixing curd honey and clarified butter he feeds him with a strip of gold not obstructed by anything saying i put the earth into you i put the sky into you i put heaven into you i put the whole of the earth sky and heaven into you \n the he gives him a name you are veda knowledge \n that is his secret name\n then he hands him to his mother to be suckled saying offering sarasvati that breast of yours which is stored with results is the sustainer of all full of milk the obtainer of wealth one s deserts and generous and through which you nourishest all who are woryour of it the gods etc\n transfer that here to my wife for my babe to suck \n then he addressed the mother you are the adorable arundhati the wife of vasistha you have brought forth a male child with the help of me who am a man\n be the mother of many sons for you have given us a son \n of him who is born as the child of a brahmana with this particular knowledge they say you have exceeded your father and you have exceeded your grandfather\n you have reached the extreme limit of attainment through your splendour fame and brahmanical power\n now the line of teachers the son of pautimsa received it from the son of katyayani\n he from the son of gautami\n the son of gautami from the son of bharadvaji\n he from the son of parasari\n the son of parasari from the son of aupasvasti\n he from the son of another

silpa kasyapa\n this one from kasyana the son of nidhruva\n she from the sun\n these white yajuses received from the sun are explained by yajnavalkya vajasaneya\n the same up to the son of samjivi\n the son of samjivi from mandukayani\n kusri from yajnavacas the son of rajastamba\n he from tura the son of kavasi\n he from prajapati hiranyagarbha \n prajapati through his relation to brahman the vedas \n brahman is self born\n om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om peace peace peace here ends the brihadaranyopanishad as contained in the sukla yajur veda\n commentary on the brihadaranyaka upanishad by swami nirmalananda giri correcting our ideas about brahman now we come to the oldest upanishadic dialogue between teacher and student\n gargya the student will speak the truth but wiyout exact perception\n that is his statements will be either partial skewed or not of dead center accuracy\n so i will not stay much about what he says but concentrate on what the teacher ajatasatru will say in correcting his statements which are not false but imperfect and lacking\n all through this discourse ajatasatru s disagreements with gargya are only that gargya aims much to low in his views of reality whereas ajatasatru keeps insisting on viewing reality brahman not its manifestations or appearances\n it must also be kept in mind that when ajatasatru speaks of children or progeny he is speaking of the progeny of the illumined mind\n just as the scriptures speak of the mind born sons of brahma so each of has mind born offspring symbolically speaking\n thoughts words and deeds are all our children\n the pride of ignorance gargya son of valaka was a good talker but exceedingly vain\n coming one day into the presence of ajatasatru king of varanasi he accosted him with boastful speech\n gargya said i will teach you of brahman\n ajatasatru said indeed well just for that kind proposal you should be rewarded with a yousand cows\n people nowadays flock to king janaka to speak and hear of brahman i am pleased that you have come to me instead\n brihadaranyaka upanishad the sanskrit text actually says there was a man of the garga family called proud balaki who was eloquent\n shankara comments that he was proud because of his very ignorance about the real brahman\n we see this a lot in every area of life not just religion\n as someone once said the problem with ignorance is that it picks up confidence as it goes along\n it has been my observation that the more confidence some people possess the more ignorant they are\n when they speak with bullying assurance they should never be believed\n this has saved me from a lot of potentially disastrous situations\n as has been the practice in nearly all ancient cultures at that time cows were prized so highly as to even be a medium of exchange often preferred to money\n it is interesting that the oldest money found in england are huge blocks of metal embossed with the figure of a cow to indicate that each one possesses the value of one cow\n janaka was as a brief sanskrit glossary says the royal sage raja rishi who was the king of mithila and a liberated yogi a highly sought after teacher of philosophy in ancient india\n so it was very pleasing to ajatasatru that someone would approach him for philosophical discourse\n however gargya came to teach and instead was taught fortunate man the fact that he was amenable to being taught indicates that his pride was really harmless like the pride of a child\n this is a trait of a sattwic mind\n transcendent and transcending knowledge gargya said he who is the being in the sun and at the same time the being in the eye he who having entered the body through the eye resides in the heart and is the doer and the experiencer him i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as transcendental luminous supreme\n he who meditates upon brahman as such goes beyond all created beings and becomes the glorious ruler of all\n it is certainly true that brahman is all pervading and therefore immanent in all creation but it is much more and those further attributes are the ones so necessary for the aspiring yogi to learn\n that which gargya said can be held by any devoted religious person in ignorance\n but ajatasatru s assertions are the last word in the matter both as to the true nature of brahman and that which he will himself become who comes to know this of brahman by the direct experience possible only to adept yogis\n brahman is not confined to this present world experience and neither are we in our true nature\n this must be realized if we would be free mukta \n beyond the mind gargya said the being who is in the moon and at the same time in the mind him i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as infinite clad in purity blissful resplendent\n he who meditates upon brahman as such lacks nothing and is forever happy\n brahman is certainly in the mind manas but cannot be grasped by the mind for it is an instrument of illusory perception\n the intellect buddhi can be so purified that it becomes a mirror reflection of spirit being which is why the gita emphasizes buddhi yoga\n the buddhi can perceive brahman as infinite clad in purity blissful resplendent\n such is the gateway to the fulfillment of all right desires and unbroken bliss\n omnipotence gargya said the being who is in the lightning and at the same time in the heart him i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as power\n he who meditates upon brahman as such becomes powerful and his children after him\n we see astounding phenomena in creation but they are only appearances however wondrous\n brahman is their source but it is the power that produces those phenomena it is their foundation wiyout which they could not occur\n brahman is unlimited potential\n and so are those who come to know brahman\n omnipresence gargya said the being who is in the sky and at the same time in the heart him i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as all pervading changeless\n he who meditates upon brahman as such is blessed with children and with cattle\n the thread of his progeny shall never be cut\n brihadaranyaka upanishad brahman is not just in a lot of places brahman is everywhere and within all things for it is all things\n and this all pervasiveness is eternal has been so forever\n invincible gargya said the being who is in the wind and who at the same time is the breath within him i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as the lord invincible and unconquerable\n he who meditates upon brahman as such becomes himself invincible and unconquerable\n wind and breath wax wane and cease brahman never does\n it cannot be even affected by anything much less controlled\n forbearing gargya said the being who is in the fire and at the same time in the heart him i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as forgiving forbearing \n he who meditates upon brahman as such becomes himself forgiving and his children after him\n the idea here is that being within all things brahman experiences all that happens to them\n that is why bishop james i\n wedgwood an adherent of advaita vedanta wrote the prayer he called an act of union unto thee o perfect one the lord and lover of men do we commend our life and hope\n for thou art the heavenly bread the life of the whole world thou art in all places and endurest all things the treasury of endless good and the well of infinite compassion\n brahman is not just in many things it is the consciousness inside of all things as the infinite witness\n harmony gargya said the being who is in the water and at the same time in the heart him i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as harmony\n he who meditates upon brahman as such knows only what is harmonious\n of him are born tranquil children\n water takes the form of any vessel into which it is poured\n it is the softest of substances and has no innate resistance\n water pressure comes from restraining forms not from water itself\n thus it is a perfect symbol of harmony or agreeableness as madhavananda translates it\n ajatasatru points out that we should not exalt finite objects that exemplify woryour characteristics but brahman which is those traits the substances and objects only being tiny reflections of brahman\n we must not mistake the mirror image for the actual object\n self effulgent gargya said the being who is in the mirror him i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as effulgent\n he who meditates upon brahman as such becomes himself effulgent and his children after\n he shines brighter than all who approach him\n the ancient indians were far more sophisticated than is known in the west\n alyough i once read such an idea denounced as hindu fundamentalism and militant hinduism it is my serious belief that india has in the past attained levels of technology medicine and all aspects of culture that have been undreamed of elsewhere on earth\n india truly has forgotten more than the modern world can possibly know\n this verse is an instance of this\n we see our reflection in a mirror because light waves strike the surface of our bodies and clothing and as they are deflected into the mirror we see an image there\n but brahman is swayamprakash its own illumination\n that is why christian mysticism speaks of divinity as the light of light\n brahman is the source the cause not the effect\n he shining everything shines\n life itself gargya said the sound that follows a man as he walks that i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as the vital force\n he who meditates upon brahman as such reaches his full age in this world breath does not leave him before his time\n brahman is life itself existence itself\n all phenomena are simply echoes of brahman\n as just quoted he shining everything shines\n my own self gargya said the being who pervades space him i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as a second self who can never be separated from me\n he who meditates upon brahman as such is never lonely and his followers never forsake him\n brahman is not outside us as any thing\n rather brahman is our own self\n what is most important about this verse is that it indicates the important truth that brahman is our second self not our atman in the simplistic sense\n for that would mean that we do not even exist that as false advaita says when we attain realization we will cease to exist and only brahman will remain\n this is not the teaching of the upanishads or the gita\n brahman is the self of our self\n first we must come to know our own individual self and then proceed to know the supreme self brahman\n brahman is at the core of our self inseparable from it\n how this can be is beyond human intelligence but not beyond our experience our direct knowing\n buddhi yoga is the key\n divine will gargya said the being who dwells in the heart as intelligence him i meditate upon as brahman\n ajatasatru said nay nay do not speak thus of brahman\n that being i worship as the lord of will\n he who meditates upon brahman as such achieves self control and his children after him\n intelligence or buddhi is centered in the subtle body known as the jnanamaya kosha which corresponds to the air vayu element\n but the subtlest body is the anandamaya kosha which corresponds to the ether akasha element\n that is the seat of will the highest power of the individual\n the only thing higher is the self and since it borders on the self the self whose self is brahman is the lord of will\n we can see this in our daily life\n we choose what we will or will not think about\n sometimes we even shove youghts out of our mind refusing to think on certain subjects or postponing yought till a later time\n so the self is the direct controller of the will\n the will determines everything and even unsophisticated philosophy considers free will the prime trait of a human being\n insufficient gargya ceased speaking\n ajatasatru continuing questioned him\n ajatasatru said is that all that you know of brahman gargya said that is all that i know\n ajatasatru said by knowing only so much one cannot profess to know brahman\n gargya said please sir accept me as a disciple and teach me of brahman\n a practical demonstration ajatasatru said i will teach you\n so saying ajatasatru took gargya by the hand and rose\n then as the two walked side by side they came to a sleeping man\n ajatasatru said to the sleeper o you great one clad in white raiment o soma o king at first the man did not stir\n then as ajatasatru touched him he awoke\n occasionally in the upanishads we find humor used to make a point and this is one of them\n coming across a sleeping man ajatasatru addressed him as the divine self o you great one clad in white raiment o soma o king but it did no good for the man was unconscious\n it was pointless to address him at all\n in the same way all the positive affirming and philosophizing are worthless if the speaker and the hearers are spiritually asleep sleepers do not need high sounding words about the self they need to awaken\n so ajatasatru shook him until he woke up\n we need to be shaken up to awaken and see with our real eyes and hear with our real ears\n otherwise nothing will really go on\n the truth being spoken to us means nothing if we are not awake to hear it\n yoga is the great awakener\n other factors can disturb our sleep get us to open our eyes a bit and then go back to sleep and just mumble and turn over and sleep on\n all the religion and piety mean absolutely nothing if we are not awake and clear in the mind\n ajatasatru now analyzes sleep dream and dreamless sleep\n the sleeper ajatasatru said to gargya this man who is a conscious intelligent being where was he when he was thus asleep and how did he thus wake up gargya was silent\n when this man who is a conscious intelligent being is thus in deep sleep he enters into the ether within the lotus of the heart having withdrawn into himself both his senses and his mind\n when his senses and his mind are thus withdrawn he is said to be absorbed in the lower self\n in this state he knows nothing he enters into the seventy two yousand nerves nadis which go out from the lotus of the heart\n even as a young man or an emperor or the best of brahmins when he has experienced the ecstasy of love straightway takes sweet repose so does a man deep in sleep find rest\n but when he sleeps but also dreams he lives in a world of his own\n he may dream that he is a king or that he is the best of brahmins he may dream that he is an angel or that he is a beast\n as an emperor having obtained the objects of enjoyment moves about at will in his dominions so the sleeper gathering up the impressions of sense compounds them into dreams according to his desires\n in sleep we withdraw from the physical senses\n in dream we are using the astral senses to create whatever our mind decides\n in dreamless sleep we are centered in the causal body\n we can even think in such a state wiyout waking yough it is not common to do so\n yet as ajatasatru points out we are always conscious witnessing the dream and dreamless states just as we witness the waking state\n even more when we awaken we often remember the dreams and even say i did not dream showing that we remember dreamlessness as vividly as we do dreaming and waking\n that witnessing conscious is our self pure being itself\n the source the bottom line is that the self is the source of our waking dreaming and dreamless sleep\n it is the source of our entire life determining every aspect\n so ajatasatru concludes with these words as threads come out of the spider as little sparks come out of the fire so all the senses all the worlds all the gods yea all beings issue forth from the self\n his secret name is truth of the truth\n the self and ultimately brahman is are the origin and existence of all things\n when we know that self we know possess and control all\n that and that alone is what it means to be a master\n the dearness of the self now we come to the best known dialogue of this upanishad the conversation between the great sage yajnavalkya and maitreyi his wife\n maitreyi and gargi whom we will meet later in this upanishad are evidence that in the time of the ancient sages women were among their number and were teachers of brahman in their own right\n true hindu traditionalists such as the arya samajis make no distinction between male and female in the spiritual rituals samskaras received all wearing the sacred thread yajnopavita and performing the vedic rites\n the most perfect and powerful fire sacrifice i have ever attended was that of the high school girls in the arya samaj girls school in baroda\n i have never seen better brahmains than those intelligent and skilled young women\n i hope they have retained the glorious wisdom they learned at that true gurukula under the direction of the venerable sage pandit anandapriya of the arya samaj\n the vital question yajnavalkya said to his wife maitreyi i am resolved to give up the world and begin the life of renunciation\n i wish therefore to divide my property between you and my other wife katyayani\n maitreyi said my lord if this whole earth belonged to me with all its wealth should i through its possession attain immortality yajnavalkya said no\n your life would be like that of the rich\n none can possibly hope to attain immortality through wealth\n maitreyi said then what need have i of wealth please my lord tell me what you know about the way to immortality\n yajnavalkya said dear to me have you always been maitreyi and now you ask to learn of that truth which is nearest my heart\n come sit by me\n i will explain it to you\n meditate on what i say\n what a beautiful picture i cannot count the number of enslaved spiritual men who have rhapsodized to me about how special their wives were that turned out to really be materialistic anti spiritual manipulative harpies\n women have better sense they rarely extol the duds they are married to yough both sexes are quite willing to use their spouse as justification for neglecting or abandoning spiritual life\n after all they have taken vows and taken obligations on themselves god for another life has to go to the end of the line and wait\n but that is not what we see here\n we see a real spiritual marriage in action\n in those days the life of a sannyasi was one of perpetual wandering so there is no yought of maitreyi accompanying yajnavalkya in his new stage of life\n but we can be assured that her sadhana was no less intense than his for she has been honored for centuries as one of the great illuminati of india no less than her husband\n yajnavalkya calls maitreyi priya which mean dear beloved and pleasing\n and he does not mean it in the small minded egocentric way we are so inured to\n and lest she think so he now begins one of the most quoted passages of the upanishads\n for the sake of the self it is not for the sake of the husband my beloved that the husband is dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the wife my beloved that the wife is dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the children my beloved that the children are dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of wealth my beloved that wealth is dear but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the brahmins my beloved that the brahmins are held in reverence but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the kshatriyas my beloved that the kshatriyas are held in honor but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the higher worlds my beloved that the higher worlds are desired but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the gods my beloved that the gods are worshipped but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of the creatures my beloved that the creatures are prized but for the sake of the self\n it is not for the sake of itself my beloved that anything whatever is esteemed but for the sake of the self\n the self maitreyi is to be known\n hear about it reflect upon it meditate upon it\n by knowing the self my beloved through hearing reflection and meditation one comes to know all things\n the self atman is of the nature of bliss ananda \n when the things enumerated above are encountered a person feels a touch of the joy that is the self\n actually our response to them opens the barrier between us and the self for a while and like the light coming through the shutter of a camera we get a flash a glimpse of the bliss of the self\n what we are really valuing is that touch of the self but in our ignorance we think those objects are the source\n therefore it really is because of for the sake of the self that they are yought by us as dear\n the wise seek to know the self through study deep yought and meditation upon the self\n and we are assured that by knowing the self through hearing reflection and meditation one comes to know all things\n all are the self to know the self is to know everything\n to not know the self is to know nothing\n so the sage continues let the brahmin ignore him who thinks that the brahmin is different from the self\n let the kshatriya ignore him who thinks that the kshatriya is different from the self\n let the higher worlds ignore him who thinks that the higher worlds are different from the self\n let the gods ignore him who thinks that the gods are different from the self\n let all creatures ignore him who thinks that the creatures are different from the self\n let all ignore him who thinks that anything whatever is different from the self\n the priest the warrior the higher worlds the gods the creatures whatsoever things there be these are the self\n that is certainly clear\n and so is this as when the drum is beaten its various particular notes are not heard apart from the whole but in the total sound all its notes are heard as when the conch shell is blown its various particular notes are not heard apart from the whole but in the total sound all its notes are heard as when the vina is played its various particular notes are not heard apart from the whole but in the total sound all its notes are heard so through the knowledge of the self pure intelligence all things and beings are known\n there is no existence apart from the self\n the incredible spectacle of the endless creations of infinite elaboration springs only from brahman and has no existence apart from brahman\n the same is true of our own continuing saga of lifetimes it all emanates from the self\n the cosmic and individual dreams arise only from consciousness\n the dreams are illusion yet wisdom jnana is inherent in them\n so yajnavalkya further says as smoke and sparks arise from a lighted fire kindled with damp fuel even so maitreyi have been breathed forth from the eternal all knowledge and all wisdom what we know as the rig veda the yajur veda and the rest\n they are the breath of the eternal\n brihadaranyaka upanishad the all pervading center as for water the one center is the ocean as for touch the one center is the skin as for smell the one center is the nose as for taste the one center is the tongue as for form the one center is the eyes as for sound the one center is the ears as for yought the one center is the mind as for divine wisdom the one center is the heart so for all beings the one center is the self\n in the twenty second chapter of autobiography of a yogi paramhansa yogananda describes seeing with the eye of the self spiritual sight x raylike penetrates into all matter the divine eye is center everywhere circumference nowhere\n i realized anew standing there in the sunny courtyard that when man ceases to be a prodigal child of god engrossed in a physical world indeed dream baseless as a bubble he reinherits his eternal realms\n if escapism be a need of man cramped in his narrow personality can any escape compare with the majesty of omnipresence as a lump of salt when thrown into water melts away and the lump cannot be taken out but wherever we taste the water it is salty even so o maitreyi the individual self dissolved is the eternal pure consciousness infinite and transcendent\n individuality arises by identification of the self through ignorance with the elements and with the disappearance of consciousness of the many in divine illumination it disappears\n where there is consciousness of the self seeming individual separation is no more\n this it is o my beloved that i wanted to tell you\n a doubt maitreyi said where there is consciousness of the self individual separation is no more\n this that you say my lord confuses me\n yajnavalkya said my beloved let nothing i have said confuse you\n but meditate well the truth that i have spoken\n as long as there is duality one sees the other one hears the other one smells the other one speaks to the other one thinks of the other one knows the other but when for the illumined soul the all is dissolved in the self who is there to be seen by whom who is there to be smelt by whom who is there to be heard by whom who is there to be spoken to by whom who is there to be yought of by whom who is there to be known by whom ah maitreyi my beloved the intelligence which reveals all by what shall it be revealed by whom shall the knower be known the self is described as not this not that\n it is incomprehensible for it cannot be comprehended undecaying for it never decays unattached for it never attaches itself unbound for it is never bound\n by whom o my beloved shall the knower be known this it is that i teach you o maitreyi\n this is the truth of immortality\n so saying yajnavalkya entered upon the path of renunciation\n brihadaranyaka upanishad yajnavalkya is not saying that the enlightened go into a kind of non dual coma in which nothing is perceived\n rather he says that those who have known brahman even yough they still hear and see names and forms they know that they are not seeing something other but are seeing only the supreme self\n they do not just believe that they see that to be so\n only the one remains however many things might be seen in the cosmic dream\n nothing other can reveal this consciousness to us for that is the revealer never the revealed\n for the vision of god takes place within not wiyout yough afterward we do see divinity both within and wiyout\n the machine does not run the operator the operator runs the machine\n because of its transcendent nature brahman is described as neti neti not this not that\n we can only say what brahman is not and when we come to the end having negated everything what remains yough unspeakable and inconceivable is brahman\n by whom o my beloved shall the knower be known only to itself to our self\n divine sweetness we have had a discourse on how it is the self that makes all things dear or beloved to us\n we often use the expression sweet to express our pleasure or delight in something and so the upanishad speaks of how all things are honey madhu because brahman is the soul in each he indeed is the self in all\n the nature of brahman is bliss ananda and brahman is the soul the self of all\n consequently all things are joy for the awakened and realized person\n to avoid tedium from the type of repetition that is found in many sanskrit texts and in many pali sutras of buddhism i will just give the first honey verse and the simply list all of the subjects covered since except for the keyword each verse is absolutely identical\n this earth is honey for all beings and all beings are honey for this earth\n the intelligent immortal being the soul of this earth and the intelligent immortal being the soul in the individual being each is honey to the other\n brahman is the soul in each he indeed is the self in all\n verses two to fourteen affirm the joyful nature of water fire air the sun space the moon lightning thunder ether dharma truth satyam humanity manusham and all things sarvesham \n the upanishad them sums it all up with the following verses this self is the lord of all beings the king of all beings\n as the spokes are held together in the hub and in the felly of a wheel just so all beings all creatures all gods all worlds all lives are held together in the self\n he made bodies with two feet he made bodies with four feet\n he entered into all bodies and because he dwells within the lotus of the heart he is known as purusha\n there is nothing that is not surrounded by him nothing that is not filled with him\n he assumed all forms\n he assumed all forms to reveal himself in all forms\n he the lord is revealed in an forms through his maya\n he is tens he is yousands he is numberless\n this brahman is wiyout cause wiyout effect wiyout inside or outside\n this brahman is the self\n the wisdom of the wise the next section of the upanishad is a marvel of wisdom that opens with some humor\n i want those cows janaka king of videha on a certain occasion performed a sacrifice and in connection therewith distributed costly gifts\n among those who attended the ceremony were the wise men of kuru and of panchala\n king janaka observed them and wanted to find out which was the wisest\n now it happened that the king kept a yousand cows enclosed in a pen and between the horns of every one of them were fastened ten gold coins\n venerable brahmins said king janaka let him who is the wisest among you take away these cows\n the brahmins dared not stir save yajnavalkya alone\n my learned son said yajnavalkya to his disciple drive home my cows\n hurrah cried the lad and made for them\n the rest of the brahmins were enraged\n how dare he call himself the wisest they shouted\n at last aswala priest to king janaka accosted yajnavalkya saying yajnavalkya are you quite sure you are the wisest among us i bow down replied yajnavalkya to the wisest\n but i want those cows then aswala began to question him\n as already mentioned janaka is considered the prime example of a worldly person who attained perfect knowledge\n he is also considered the prime example of one who possessed great wealth\n rich as janaka is the indian equivalent of the west s rich as midas\n it was the custom for those who attended spiritual events to be given rich gifts and it was obvious to all those at the sacrifice that the yousand cows and ten yousand gold coins strung between their horns were meant to be given to the one who could best expound philosophy and answer all challenging questions\n it may be that the ten yousand padas of gold mentioned in the text were not coins of one pada each but covers with large gold knobs that were affixed to the cows horns\n those who attended the sacrifice were truly wise men for they were also modest\n when told that the cows and gold were for the wisest among them they dared not stir\n yajnavalkya on the other hand was tactful\n he told a student to take the cows to his home rather than claim he was the wisest yough he was and knew he was\n when challenged by aswala he said i bow down to the wisest but i want those cows in this way he masked his wisdom with humor that appeared to be simple greed\n saints often do this pretending to be ignorant or unaware hiding their true status from the truly ignorant and unaware who blinded by their ego are always fooled by the ruse \n swami sivananda often did this as i witnessed myself\n only the wise dare to be yought a fool\n now there follows the questioning of yajnavalkya\n how to overcome death aswala said yajnavalkya since everything connected with sacrificial rites is pervaded by death and is subject to death by what means can the worshiper overcome death yajnavalkya said by knowledge of the identity between the worshiper the fire and the ritual word\n for the ritual word is indeed the worshiper and the ritual word is the fire and the fire which is one with brahman is the worshiper\n this knowledge leads to liberation this knowledge leads one beyond death\n all relative things begin and end are born and die in a manner of speaking\n everything that is connected with the fire sacrifice is perishable including the fire itself all are pervaded by death and subject to death\n obviously then the sacrifice cannot lead to immortality\n so how can we overcome go beyond is the literal wording death the answer is simple by knowing the non dual brahman which alone is immortal and immortality itself\n what eats death aswala held his peace\n but artabhaga asked yajnavalkya everything is the food of death\n is there any power for which death is food yajnavalkya said indeed yes\n fire devours everything and fire again is the food of water\n similarly there is a death to death\n the knower of the truth of brahman overcomes death\n those who know brahman have devoured death just as the eater of food transmutes it into his own body and lives on it\n so death itself is the gateway of immortality to the yogi\n the liberated at death artabhaga said yajnavalkya when such an one gives up his body do his perceptive faculties along with his mind go out of him or do they not yajnavalkya said they do not\n they merge in the final cause the self\n the body lies lifeless inflated and swollen\n in relative existence we possess five levels\n artabhaga is asking if all but the physical material levels or bodies go along with the liberated individual at the departure from the body\n yajnavalkya replies that the pranic pranamaya and sensory mind manomaya bodies do not go along with the liberated person but are resolved back into the universal energy from which they arose when he entered into relativity\n we only take with us the buddhi jnanamaya and creative will anandamaya bodies which are causal in nature the seats of intellect and intuition respectively\n for the liberated are free forever of the physical and astral bodies yough they can take new ones on again if they elect to return to incarnation in the astral or physical worlds as avatar saviors in those worlds\n the atman self artabhaga held his peace\n then ushasta asked yajnavalkya what is the ultimate the immediate brahman brahman himself alone directly realized as such the self which dwells within all yajnavalkya pointing to his heart said this your self which is within all\n ushasta said which self o yajnavalkya is within all yajnavalkya said that which breathes in is your self which is within all\n that which breathes down is your self which is within all\n that which diffuses breath is your self which is within all\n that which breathes out is your self which is within all\n again i reply this your self which is within all\n brahman is the self within the self that enlivens and activates all through the functions of the five pranas\n if we can trace back the pranas especially through the breath we will find the self\n ushasta said as one might say in distinguishing a cow from a horse that the cow is the animal that walks and the horse is the animal that runs exactly so simple so clear o wise one has been your teaching about brahman but tell me i ask again who is the ultimate the immediate brahman brahman himself alone directly realized as such the self which dwells within all yajnavalkya said this your self which is within all\n ushasta said which self o yajnavalkya is within all yajnavalkya said thou canst not see the seer of the sight you canst not hear the hearer of the sound you canst not think the thinker of the yought you canst not know the knower of the known\n again i reply this your self which is within all\n anything that is not the self perishes\n ushasta held his peace\n there is only one self the self that cannot be seen heard yought or known by the limited mind\n it being inside everything is not an object of perception\n if we take away all things only the self remains knowing itself by itself\n naturally this is not easy to grasp intellectually because the self is far beyond the intellect\n nevertheless these truths can be known by the yogi\n kahola asked yajnavalkya what is the ultimate the immediate brahman brahman himself alone directly realized as such the self which dwells within all yajnavalkya said this your self which is within all\n kohala said which self o yajnavalkya is within all yajnavalkya said that which is beyond hunger thirst grief delusion decay and death\n having realized this self the sages renounce the craving for progeny wealth and existence in the other worlds and live the life of mendicants\n the craving for progeny leads to the craving for wealth and the craving for wealth to the craving for existence in the other worlds\n thus there are two cravings craving for a life of enjoyment here and craving for a life of greater enjoyment hereafter\n therefore should a sage when he has fully attained the knowledge of the self desire to live with that knowledge as his only refuge\n when he has fully attained that knowledge and realized it as his only refuge he should devote himself exclusively to contemplation of the self\n he alone is the true knower of brahman who directs his mind towards the self and shuns all other youghts as distractions\n how does such a knower of brahman act and conduct himself whatever he may do or howsoever he may conduct himself he is free from craving and is forever established in the knowledge of brahman\n anything that is not the self perishes\n kahola held his peace\n those who know the self turn from the nonsense and ties of the world and lead the life of a bhikshu a monk\n alyough in modern times either sannyasi or sadhu is used to designate a monk in earlier centuries bhikshu one who lives on alms was also quite common usage\n those wiyout ties but with good sense knowing this lead that life from the beginning of their quest\n those that learn of the self after have tied themselves to the world and yet are wise begin right away moving toward the life of renunciation and loosening those ties anticipating the day when they will walk away into freedom\n it is not unknown for a realized person to continue living at home but in total separation from any obligations that it might entail for others and certainly utterly out of the game of home life\n such a one was yogiraj sri shyama charan lahiri as a study of his life especially in autobiography of a yogi will reveal\n however those who do not live exactly as he did are deluding themselves if they think they are like him\n those who are knowers consider that knowledge their only refuge the only stable thing in their life and live ever in meditation on the self\n a lot of ignoramuses and skallawags claim to be enlightened and able to teach others the way of enlightenment but yajnvaklya tells us he alone is the true knower of brahman who directs his mind towards the self and shuns all other youghts as distractions\n and whatever he may do or howsoever he may conduct himself he is free from craving and is forever established in the knowledge of brahman\n it is a pity that unlike kahola they do not hold their peace\n the sutratman the thread self in the bhagavad gita we read nothing higher than me exists\n on me all this universe is strung like pearls on a thread\n this concept is upanishadic uddalaka spoke yajnavalkya we lived as students in madra in the house of kapya whose wife was once possessed by a gandharva a celestial singer\n we asked the gandharva who he was\n he replied that he was kabandha and proceeded to question kapya thus dost you know that thread whereon this life the next life and all beings are strung together kapya did not know\n the gandharva continued dost you know that inner ruler who controls from within this life the next life and all beings kapya did not know\n the gandharva then said he who knows that thread and that inner ruler knows brahman knows the worlds knows the gods knows the vedas knows the creatures knows the self knows all things\n i myself know these things that the gandharva taught\n yajnavalkya if you wiyout knowing that thread and that inner ruler take the cows that belong only to the wisest accursed shalt you be\n yajnavalkya said i know that thread and that inner ruler\n uddalaka said anybody can say i know i know\n tell us what you know\n this questioning contains a lot of facts regarding the self it is the connecting foundation of all beings\n it is the cohesive force that impels all beings through a succession of lives for their evolution\n it is the absolute ruler and controller of all lives and beings as their inmost essential nature\n to know the self is to know all things both the manifester and the manifested\n yajnavalkya said the subtle principle of life is that thread whereon this life and the next life and all beings are strung\n hence when a man dies they say his limbs are loosed for while he lives they are held together by that principle of life\n uddalaka said that is true yajnavalkya\n now speak of the inner ruler\n the self is the principle of life itself\n present but separate yajnavalkya said he who dwells on earth but is separate from the earth whom the earth does not know whose body the earth is and who controls the earth from within he the self is the inner ruler the immortal\n he who dwells in water but is separate from water whom water does not know whose body water is and who controls water from within he the self is the inner ruler the immortal\n he who dwells in fire but is separate from fire whom fire does not know whose body fire is and who controls fire from within he the self is the inner ruler the immortal\n he who dwells in the sky in the air in heaven in the four quarters in the sun in the moon in the stars in ether in darkness in light but is separate from them whom none of them knows whose body they are and who controls them from within he the self is the inner ruler the immortal\n he who dwells in all beings but is separate from all beings whom no being knows whose body all beings are and who controls all beings from within he the self is the inner ruler the immortal\n he who dwells in odor speech sight hearing and touch but is separate from them whom odor speech sight hearing and touch do not know whose body is odor speech sight hearing and touch are and who controls them all from within he the self is the inner ruler the immortal\n he who dwells in the mind but is separate from the mind whom the mind does not know whose body the mind is and who controls the mind from within he the self is the inner ruler the immortal\n he who dwells in the intellect but is separate from the intellect whom the intellect does not know whose body the intellect is and who controls the intellect from within he the self is the inner ruler the immortal\n unseen but the seer unheard but the hearer unthinkable but the thinker unknown but the knower there is no seer but he there is no hearer but he there is no other but he there is no knower but he\n he the self is the inner ruler the immortal\n anything that is not the self perishes\n uddalaka held his peace\n if we have not figured this out already nothing can be said that will give us the idea\n but we do have the idea and this is an affirmation intended to confirm us in our understanding\n gargi and the imperishable now we hear from the female sage gargi\n then arose gargi the daughter of vachaknu and addressed the sages revered brahmins i shall ask yajnavalkya two questions\n if he is able to answer them no one among you can ever defeat him\n he will be the great expounder of the truth of brahman\n yajnavalkya said ask o gargi\n gargi said yajnavalkya as the son of a warrior from kashi or videha might string his loosened bow and with two deadly arrows in his hand rise to give battle even so have i risen to fight you with two questions\n yajnavalkya said ask o gargi\n gargi said yajnavalkya that of which they say that it is above heaven and below the earth which is between heaven and earth as well and which was is and shall be tell me in what is it woven warp and woof yajnavalkya said that of which they say o gargi that it is above heaven and below the earth which is between heaven and earth as well and which was is and shall be that is woven warp and woof in the ether\n ether akasha is the subtlest element so subtle that it is often indistinguishable from consciousness\n wiyout it nothing can exist\n yet there is more so gargi persists\n gargi said thou hast answered my first question\n i bow to you o yajnavalkya\n be ready now to answer my second question\n yajnavalkya said ask o gargi\n gargi said in whom is that ether woven warp and woof yajnavalkya said the seers o gargi call him akshara the changeless reality\n he is neither gross nor fine neither short nor long neither hot nor cold neither light nor dark neither of the nature of air nor of the nature of ether\n he is wiyout relations\n he is wiyout taste or smell wiyout eyes ears speech mind vigor breath mouth he is wiyout measure he is wiyout inside or outside\n he enjoys nothing nothing enjoys him\n akshara means imperishable indestructible and immutable\n it is sometimes a synonym for the chidakasha the ether of consciousness in which the element of ether rests\n as yajnavalkya makes clear the imperishable brahman and the imperishable self are no thing having not attributes or form whatsoever yet it is infinite and omnipresent\n he enjoys nothing because there is no second no separate object for brahman to be involved with or relate to\n and nothing enjoys him because no thing can perceive brahman\n things do not really exist\n brahman on the other hand is the sole existence\n at the command of that akshara o gargi sun and moon hold their courses\n at the command of that akshara o gargi heaven and earth keep their positions\n at the command of that akshara o gargi moments hours days and nights fortnights and months seasons and years all follow their paths\n at the command of that akshara o gargi rivers issuing from the snowy mountains flow on some eastward some westward others in other directions\n he o gargi who in this world wiyout knowing this akshara offers oblations performs sacrifices practices austerities even yough for many yousands of years gains little his offerings and practices are perishable\n he o gargi who departs this life wiyout knowing the imperishable is pitiable\n but he o gargi who departs this life knowing the akshara is wise\n this akshara o gargi is unseen but is the seer is unheard but is the hearer is unthinkable but is the thinker is unknown but is the knower\n there is no seer but he there is no hearer but he there is no thinker but he there is no knower but he\n in akshara verily o gargi the ether is woven warp and woof\n gargi said revered brahmins well may you feel blest if you get off with bowing before him no one will defeat yajnavalkya expounder of the truth of brahman\n gargi held her peace\n is it any wonder that men and women throughout the ages have devoted their entire lives to the pursuit of the knowledge of brahman what else is there yajnavalkya addressed the sages revered brahmins ask me questions if you will any one of you in the assembly or all of you\n or if any one of you so desires i will question him\n or i will question all of you\n but the brahmins held their peace\n let us hope they returned home and doubled and tripled their efforts to realize brahman\n and so may we for that is the purpose of this section\n janaka and yajnavalkya we come now to the lengthiest dialogue in any of the upanishads\n swami prabhavananda ended his translation of the upanishad at its conclusion evidently feeling that anything following it would be of vastly inferior value\n wealth or knowledge on a certain occasion janaka king of videha having seated himself to give audience saw the sage yajnavalkya among his visitors and accosted him\n janaka said yajnavalkya what brings you here do you come for cattle or for philosophy yajnavalkya said for both your majesty\n the great sages whether past or present always have a sense of humor\n and they are not interested in how they look to others\n i have seen both of these principles more than once in swami sivananda and other great yogis in india\n humorous yough it be this verse has a real message the intelligent yogi is interested in the total picture both material and spiritual\n it is ignorance that postulates an incompatibility between material and spiritual life\n it is ignorance that creates the problem not matter or spirit\n after all matter is a manifestation of spirit\n both janaka and yajnavalkya were rich in material possessions and in wisdom\n in america we have had two men that were equally successful in finance and spirituality j\n penney founder of penney s department store chain and james j\n lynn whose many branched multimillion dollar empire could not keep him from becoming one of this country s greatest yogis and the successor of paramhansa yogananda as president of self realization fellowship\n in india i met men of fabulous wealth whose whole mind and heart were centered in spirit consciousness while working tirelessly for the welfare of the people\n as sri ramakrishna said if you can weigh salt you can weigh sugar\n word brahman yajnavalkya said i wish to hear what your teachers may have taught you\n janaka said jitwa taught me that the word vak is brahman\n yajnavalkya said as one who in childhood was instructed adequately first by his mother and then by his father and after that was initiated into the sacred mysteries by a sage as such an one should teach so has jitwa taught you the truth when he said that the word is brahman\n for what could a person achieve wiyout the word but did he tell you about the abode and support of this word brahman janaka said no he did not\n yajnavalkya said then you have been only partly taught\n janaka said do you then teach me o yajnavalkya\n yajnavalkya said the organ of speech is its abode and ether the primal cause of the universe is its eternal support\n meditate upon the word as identical with knowledge\n janaka said what is knowledge yajnavalkya yajnavalkya said the word is knowledge your majesty\n for through the word a friend is known and likewise all knowledge spiritual or otherwise\n through the word is gained knowledge of this world and of the next\n through the word is obtained knowledge of all creatures\n the word your majesty is the supreme brahman\n janaka said i give you a yousand cows with a bull as big as an elephant for teaching me\n yajnavalkya said my father was of the opinion that one should not accept any reward from a disciple wiyout fully instructing him\n the power of word both conceptualization and verbal expression of concepts is the distinctive feature of the human being alyough many other species on earth use sound for communication\n there is great power is speech for many reasons some intellectual and some esoteric\n yajnavalkya points out that it is not enough to appreciate the power of word but we must know that which gives word it power what is its abode and support\n he then tells us that it is the faculty of speech the innate capacity of the human being for speech that is the abode of word for wiyout the faculty of speech there could be no word expressed\n yet that is not the ultimate basis of the word\n ether the primal cause of the universe is its eternal support\n here again the chidakasha is meant\n sound arises out of the element of ether and the consciousness behind intelligent sound is the chidakasha the self of the nature of consciousness\n so it is this consciousness that is the origin of the word brahman the shabda brahman whose primary form is om\n that word is to be meditated upon as prajna knowledge the inmost consciousness\n my father was of the opinion that one should not accept any reward from a disciple wiyout fully instructing him\n this tells us two things yajnavalkya possessed a spiritual lineage a tradition with roots\n also he considered that partial knowledge was of little value\n breath brahman yajnavalkya said i wish to know what anyone else may have taught you\n janaka said udanka taught me that breath prana is brahman\n he did not tell me about its abode and support\n yajnavalkya said prana is its abode and ether akasha its support\n it should be meditated upon as dear\n for life is indeed dear\n the primal energy is brahman\n brihadaranyaka upanishad when we breathe we live and when we stop breathing we die\n that is why breath holds such a principal place in the practice of yoga\n however the breath is just the objectified physical manifestation of the inner movement of prana the primal life energy within the human being\n prana is the force of life itself but it like the faculty of speech has the chidakasa as its origin and support\n the prana is indeed dear for it is the coin of life\n sight brahman now we have another of the same word passages yajnavalkya said tell me what more you have been taught\n janaka said barku taught me that the eye chakshu is brahman\n but he did not teach me its abode and support\n yajnavalkya said sight chakshu is its abode and ether its support\n it should be meditated upon as truth\n for it is by sight that objects are known\n what more have you learned the word chakshu means both the physical eye and the faculty of sight\n the eye is meaningless if one lacks the faculty of sight\n and that too is rooted in the chidakasha\n thus we see that all our faculties are but rays of the sun that is the chidakasha\n the next few verses are going to follow this pattern the teachers of janaka will have named the material sense organ and yajnavalkya will explain that it is the faculty and ultimately the chidakasha that is the attribute power of brahman\n hearing brahman janaka said gardabhivipati taught me that the ear shrotra is brahman\n yajnavalkya said hearing shrotra is its abode and ether its support\n it should be meditated upon as limitless\n for sound is carried by space and space is limitless\n brihadaranyaka upanishad there is a yogic aspect to this since sound in the form of subtle inner hearing is the quintessential element of meditation practice\n this faculty is rooted in the ether element which is all pervading and limitless\n thus through working with sound in meditation we can access the all pervading and limitless consciousness that is brahman\n mind brahman janaka said satyakama taught me that the mind manas is brahman\n yajnavalkya said the mind manas is its abode and ether its support\n it should be meditated upon as happiness\n for by the mind alone is happiness experienced\n brihadaranyaka upanishad here the lower sensory mind is being spoken of whose basis is the higher mind the intellect buddhi \n the important principle is the fact that happiness is only in the intelligent mind\n heart brahman janaka said vidagdha taught me that the heart hridaya is brahman\n yajnavalkya said the heart hridaya is its abode and ether its support\n it should be meditated upon as the restingplace\n for all beings find rest in the heart\n the heart is brahman\n brihadaranyaka upanishad the heart is the faculty of consciousness in the human being and that rests within the greater consciousness of brahman\n further teaching janaka descending from his throne and humbly addressing the sage said i bow down to you\n yajnavalkya please teach me\n yajnavalkya said your majesty as a person wishing to make a long journey furnishes himself with a chariot or a boat so have you equipped your mind with sacred wisdom\n you are honorable and wealyour and you have studied the vedas and learned the upanishads\n whither then shall you go when you leave this body janaka said i do not know revered sir\n yajnavalkya said i will tell you where you will go\n janaka said tell me please\n yajnavalkya said indha is the self identified with the physical self\n viraj the physical world is his wife the object of his enjoyment\n the space within the heart is their place of union in dream when the self is identified with the subtle body or mind\n the self in dreamless sleep is identified with the vital force\n beyond this is the supreme self he that has been described as not this not that\n he is incomprehensible for he cannot be comprehended he is undecaying for he never decays he is unattached for he does not attach himself he is unfettered for nothing can fetter him\n he is never hurt\n you have attained him who is free from fear o janaka and free from birth and death\n janaka said may that fearlessness come to you who teach us fearlessness\n i bow down to you\n behold this empire of videha and i myself are at your service\n brihadaranyaka upanishad in reality the liberated person does not go anywhere but abides as the self\n wherefore let us strive to know the self and transcend all coming and going\n janaka and yajnavalkya in this next conversation of yajnavalkya and janaka the first seven verses are a complete unit so to speak\n the light of human beings once when yajnavalkya came to the court of king janaka the king welcomed him with a question\n janaka said yajnavalkya what serves as the light for man yajnavalkya said the light of the sun your majesty for by the light of the sun man sits goes out does his work and returns home\n janaka said true indeed yajnavalkya\n but when the sun has set what serves then as his light yajnavalkya said the moon is then his light\n janaka said when the sun has set o yajnavalkya and the moon has set what serves then as his light yajnavalkya said the fire is then his light\n janaka said when the sun has set o yajnavalkya and the moon has set and the fire has gone out what serves then as his light yajnavalkya said sound is then his light for with sound alone as his light man sits goes out does his work and returns home\n even yough he cannot see his own hand yet when he hears a sound he moves towards it\n janaka said true indeed o yajnavalkya\n when the sun has set and the moon has set and the fire has gone out and no sound is heard what serves then as his light yajnavalkya said the self indeed is his light for by the light of the self man sits moves about does his work and when his work is done rests\n janaka said who is that self yajnavalkya said the self luminous being who dwells within the lotus of the heart surrounded by the senses and sense organs and who is the light of the intellect is that self\n becoming identified with the intellect he moves to and fro through birth and death between this world and the next\n becoming identified with the intellect the self appears to be thinking appears to be moving\n while the mind is dreaming the self also appears to be dreaming and to be beyond the next world as well as this\n brihadaranyaka upanishad this is all quite clear but it is good note that it is identity with the intellect the intelligence principle in our makeup that both enables and causes us to move between this world and another for we think that we are engaging in the functions of the intellect not realizing that it is but an instrument formed of the three gunas and is not us at all\n so we say i slept i woke up i was dreaming and so forth\n another important point is implied here\n notice that yajnavalkya does not speak of identifying with the body senses emotions etc\n this is because the upanishad is intended for the instruction of those who have evolved beyond that type of identity whose center of awareness in in the intellect in the highest level of their being\n is this eliit ist absolutely as jesus said give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you\n matthew a third point is that the self is not beyond the next world as well as this\n that is it is not subject to coming and going is neither within nor wiyout any world\n it transcends those kinds of designation\n the real root of all evil when man the individual soul is born and assumes relationship with the body and sense organs he becomes associated with the evils of the world\n when at death he gives up the body he leaves all evils behind\n yajnavalkya does not say that false identity is the problem rather that mere birth in a body creates unavoidable association with all the troubles and risks that every embodied being endures\n we see this in the life of great avatars and masters their lives were filled with troubles and many of them died quite painfully\n why anyone would pray to them to remove troubles and disease is beyond comprehension\n why do the good suffer because they are in a body\n this is a basic fact of life\n that is why spiritually intelligent people understand that the real sacrifice made by masters of all ages was their incarnation and everything went on from there\n to endure the limitations and dangers of finite existence is a great even a terrible sacrifice they undergo at every moment\n being masters inwardly as well as outwardly the sacrifice never overwhelms them and they realized the implications of birth before they were even conceived\n since they are always in charge they do not experience the mental anguish we do but they go through the entire range of earthly miseries just like anyone else\n with them everything is voluntary for they have no karma to drag them into birth and through all that happens afterward\n they walk through life while we are pushed and pulled along\n but for both them and us to escape the body is to escape it all\n and atmajnana is the only true escape\n the human status there are two states for man the state in this world and the state in the next there is also a third state the state intermediate between these two which can be likened to dream\n while in the intermediate state a man experiences both the other states that in this world and that in the next and the manner thereof is as follows when he dies he lives only in the subtle body on which are left the impressions of his past deeds and of these impressions he is aware illumined as they are by the pure light of the self\n thus it is that in the intermediate state he experiences the first state or that of life in the world\n again while in the intermediate state he foresees both the evils and the blessings that will yet come to him as these are determined by his conduct good and bad upon the earth and by the character in which this conduct has resulted\n thus it is that in the intermediate state he experiences the second state or that of life in the world to come\n we are either embodied in this world or disembodied and living in the astral realm\n but between the two is the dream state in which we experience both material and astral conditions\n for example we fall off a cliff and experience falling just as we would in the waking state\n but when we hit the ground we do not die it does not even hurt\n that is how it is in the astral world\n and that is why little children are so fearless and will go right into a life threatening situation wiyout hesitation in the astral world it is not threatening at all\n it may even be fun\n one of yogananda s monastic disciples once explained to a group of people that they should not be impatient with the intense reactions of children to pain and frustration\n for in the astral world they get anything they want just by wanting and they can go anywhere and do anything wiyout pain\n so when the situation is different in this world they are terrified and angry\n they are also miserable in realizing that they are now in a world in which uncertainty is the only certainty\n a friend of mine was once found by her father sitting in the midst of the floor crying bitterly\n she was two years old at the time\n when he asked her what was wrong she complained that she could not fly\n luckily he was a metaphysician so he explained to her that alyough she could fly in the world she had come from in this world people could not fly\n then it s a dumb world she said\n so do your best not to come back was his counsel\n when we leave our bodies we gain a great deal of understanding\n we comprehend the life that has just ended and realize its deeper meanings\n we analyze it actually and learn from it\n sometimes we have helpers in doing this\n so even yough we underwent things on earth with complete non comprehension now then see clearly their roots and their purpose\n those who do not know this often ask what good it is for infants and children to reap negative karmas and die young for they cannot understand\n indeed in this world they cannot understand but the moment they are freed from the body they can and do understand\n also it was their karma to suffer uncomprehendingly\n it all works out to perfection however it seems at the present moment\n a religion that does not teach these facts to its adherents is unworyour of anyone s attention\n and a religion that tells people that god wills it all is doing it to them because he has a plan is a barefaced liar that deserves only contempt\n but of course many people deserve a contemptible religion\n that too is karma\n dream in the intermediate state there are no real chariots nor horses nor roads but by the light of the self he creates chariots and horses and roads\n there are no real blessings nor joys nor pleasures but he creates blessings and joys and pleasures\n there are no real ponds nor lakes nor rivers but he creates ponds and lakes and rivers\n he is the creator of all these out of the impressions left by his past deeds\n just see what an incredible power of creative intelligence we all have also even dreams are a matter of karma\n paramhansa yogananda said that we can work out karma in the dream state\n regarding the different states of consciousness it is written while one is in the state of dream the golden self luminous being the self within makes the body to sleep yough he himself remains forever awake and watches by his own light the impressions of deeds that have been left upon the mind\n thereafter associating himself again with the consciousness of the organs of sense the self causes the body to awake\n in all states we are the self luminous untouched witness\n and all states are under our control\n while one is in the state of dream the golden self luminous being the self within the immortal one keeps alive the house of flesh with the help of the vital force but at the same time walks out of this house\n the eternal goes wherever he desires\n brihadaranyaka upanishad here is clear teaching that in dream we sometimes leave the body and travel in either this world or the next\n in that state the self luminous being assumes manifold forms high and low in the world of dreams\n he seems to be enjoying the pleasure of love or to be laughing with friends or to be looking at terrifying spectacles\n this experience is common to all from the least intelligent to the genius\n yet everyone is aware of the experiences no one sees the experiencer\n that is the riddle we must all solve\n some say that dreaming is but another form of waking for what a man experiences while awake he experiences again in his dreams\n be that as it may the self in dreams shines by his own light\n janaka said revered sir i offer you a yousand cattle\n instruct me further for the sake of my liberation\n free while bound even a tethered animal can move about as much as it likes within the bounds of the tether\n it is the same with us\n so we are never absolutely bound but always experience a great deal of freedom even if it is mostly psychological\n a lot of what follows is obvious and even common knowledge so no comment is needed\n yajnavalkya said the self having in dreams tasted enjoyment gone hither and thither experienced both good and evil attains to the state of dreamless sleep then again he comes back to dreams\n whatever he may experience in dreams does not affect him for the true nature of the self remains forever unaffected\n janaka said so it is indeed yajnavalkya\n i offer you another yousand cattle revered sir\n speak on for the sake of my liberation\n yajnavalkya said the self having in dreams tasted enjoyment gone hither and thither experienced good and evil hastens back to the state of waking from which he started\n whatever he may experience in dreams does not affect him for the true nature of the self remains forever unaffected\n janaka said so it is indeed yajnavalkya\n another yousand cattle shall be yours revered sir\n speak on for the sake of my liberation\n yajnavalkya said the self having in wakefulness enjoyed the pleasures of sense gone hither and thither experienced good and evil hastens back again to his dreams\n as a large fish moves from one bank of a river to the other so does the self move between dreaming and waking\n as a hawk or a falcon flying in the sky becomes tired and stretching its wings comes back to its nest so does the self hasten to that state where deep in sleep he desires no more desires and dreams no more dreams\n the transcendent self there now follows one of the most thrilling and exalted passage of the upanishads\n indeed the self in his true nature is free from craving free from evil free from fear\n as a man in the embrace of his loving wife knows nothing that is wiyout nothing that is within so man in union with the self knows nothing that is wiyout nothing that is within for in that state all desires are sait isfied\n the self is his only desire he is free from craving he goes beyond sorrow\n then father is no father mother is no mother worlds disappear gods disappear scriptures disappear the thief is no more the murderer is no more castes are no more no more is there monk or hermit\n the self is then untouched either by good or by evil and the sorrows of the heart are turned into joy\n he does not see nor smell nor taste nor speak nor hear nor think nor touch nor know for there is nothing separate from him there is no second\n yet he can see for sight and he are one yet he can smell for smelling and he are one yet he can taste for taste and he are one yet he can speak for speech and he are one yet he can hear for hearing and he are one yet he can think for thinking and he are one yet he can touch for touching and he are one yet he can know for knowing and he are one\n eternal is the light of consciousness immortal is the self\n when there is another then one sees another smells another tastes another speaks to another hears another thinks of another touches and knows another\n pure like crystal water is that self the only seer the one wiyout a second\n he is the kingdom of brahman man s highest goal supreme treasure greatest bliss\n creatures who live within the bonds of ignorance experience but a small portion of his infinite being\n brihadaranyaka upanishad for some reason swami prabhavananda omitted the next verse perhaps because it had already appeared in the taittiriya upanishad in his translation\n here is swami madhavananda s translation he who is perfect of physique and prosperous among men the ruler of others and most lavishly supplied with all human enjoyments represents greatest joy among men\n this human joy multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy for the manes who have won that world of theirs\n the joy of these manes who have won that world multiplied a hundred times makes one unit joy in the world of the celestial minstrels\n this joy in the world of the celestial minstrels multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy for the gods by action those who have attained their godhead by their actions\n this joy of the gods by action multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy for the gods by birth as also of one who is versed in the vedas sinless and free from desire\n this joy of the gods by birth multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy in the world of prajapati viraj as well as one who is versed in the vedas sinless and free from desire\n this joy in the world of prajapati multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy in the world of brahman hiranyagarbha as well as of one who is versed in the vedas sinless and free from desire\n this indeed is the supreme bliss\n this is the state of brahman o emperor said yajnavalkya\n know the self the process of reincarnation the following verses alone in all the upanishads describe to some degree the process of reincarnation\n dreaming and waking janaka said you shall have still another yousand cattle\n speak on revered sir for the sake of my liberation\n yajnavalkya said the self having in dreams enjoyed the pleasures of sense gone hither and thither experienced good and evil hastens back to the state of waking from which he started\n as a man passes from dream to wakefulness so does he pass at death from this life to the next\n when a man is about to die the subtle body mounted by the intelligent self groans as a heavily laden cart groans under its burden\n when his body becomes thin through old age or disease the dying man separates himself from his limbs even as a mango or a fig or a banyan fruit separates itself from its stalk and by the same way that he came he hastens to his new abode and there assumes another body in which to begin a new life\n passing from life to life is only a shifting in a dream\n when the stored up life force a form of karma for a life is running out just as the charge in a battery is expended and fails so do the physical and grosser pranic bodies\n and just as the ripe fruit falls from the tree so the subtle body separates itself from the material body and begins its process toward another earthly birth in a new body\n in between births the individual spends time in the astral regions sometimes just wandering and frittering his time away and sometimes in learning and evolving so his next life will be markedly better and wiser than the previous one\n this time spent in this intermediate state can be anything from a matter of hours to centuries and even yousands of years\n this is precisely determined by karma\n by the way it is nonsense to say that unevolved people reincarnate quickly and evolved people only come back in yousands of years\n both ends of the spectrum are similar very unevolved beings reincarnate very fast and so do those that are highly evolved for they are getting ready to graduate and are cramming for the final test\n leaving the body when his body grows weak and he becomes apparently unconscious the dying man gathers his senses about him and completely withdrawing their powers descends into his heart\n no more does he see form or color wiyout\n he neither sees nor smells nor tastes\n he does not speak he does not hear\n he does not think he does not know\n for all the organs detaching themselves from his physical body unite with his subtle body\n then the point of his heart where the nerves join is lighted by the light of the self and by that light he departs either through the eye or through the gate of the skull or through some other aperture of the body\n when he thus departs life departs and when life departs all the functions of the vital principle depart\n the self remains conscious and conscious the dying man goes to his abode\n the deeds of this life and the impressions they leave behind follow him\n he becomes apparently unconscious\n the person may cease to perceive anything but that is not being unconscious\n we are never unconscious at any time but we mistakenly call total absence of sensory perception unconsciousness\n there is a vital point i want to mention here\n the very last sense to fail is the sense of hearing\n sometimes it never fails\n a lot of people give up and die because they hear the doctor say there is no hope or that they will soon be dead\n so if you are around a dying unconscious person please remember this\n you can speak to them and help them either revive or go to higher worlds\n that is why both hindus and buddhists read scriptures to the dying or recite mantras or sing mantras\n in pure land buddhism people sit by the dying and sing the mantra of amida buddha continuing to do so for several hours after the person appears to be dead knowing that sometimes they may have trouble getting out of the body or may be disoriented when they do\n yogananda spoke of this to his students one of whom was the famous opera singer amelita gallicurci\n so when her brother was dying she talked to him and called him back to life\n when he became conscious he told her that he had heard doctor saying he would soon be dead so he accepted it and began drifting away\n then he heard her voice calling to him from far off and telling him to return\n so he did at one point he even saw yogananda about whom he knew virtually nothing but he recognized yogananda when his sister showed a picture to him\n it is sometimes possible to revive a person by intoning om in their right ear\n yogananda also recommended this\n then the point of his heart where the nerves join is lighted by the light of the self and by that light he departs either through the eye or through the gate of the skull or through some other aperture of the body\n this is the light that so many people tell about seeing who have returned from near death\n there are many gates by which a person may leave the body and they are all determined by the level of consciousness bhava in which he has habitually lived during his lifetime\n this is one of the major teachings of the bhagavad gita\n to leave through a center in the head is the best and will determine what highly evolved world he will enter\n those who leave through the center at the top of the head the brahmarandhra will not return to rebirth\n those who leave at lower centers in the body or spine will go to lesser worlds and some of the lowest centers are literally gates to negative worlds we call hells\n some even lead to rebirth in animal forms yough this is rare\n the self remains conscious and conscious the dying man goes to his abode\n the deeds of this life and the impressions they leave behind follow him\n some of low evolution simply go to sleep and only wake a little before reincarnating and some do not even awaken until they are born\n but the people to which this upanishad is addressed will certainly depart in full consciousness and will review their life and be aware of the psychic changes their previous actions have produced\n and they will be aware of exactly why and how they eventually find themselves in an astral or causal realm that corresponds to those karmas and samskaras\n it is all a matter of learning\n astral birth as a leech having reached the end of a blade of grass takes hold of another blade and draws itself to it so the self having left this body behind it unconscious takes hold of another body and draws himself to it\n birth in the astral world is a conscious act\n only on earth or in the negative astral worlds do we mistakenly think that we are helpless and that we are not in charge\n that is why the simile of a leech is used and why the sanskrit text literally says that we make another body for ourselves\n and that happens in earthly rebirth too\n we choose where to whom we will be born and we enter the womb of our chosen mother and taking the material provided by both parents make our next body habitation in accordance with our karma and samskara this is how powerful and intelligent we all are yogananda said in his gita commentary that the individual consciously guides the growth of his body in the womb\n that was the first sentence of yogananda s teaching that i read sitting in a public library in the fall of \n as a goldsmith taking an old gold ornament molds it into another newer and more beautiful so the self having given up the body and left it unconscious takes on a newer and better form either that of the fathers or that of the celestial singers or that of the gods or that of other beings heavenly or earthly\n in the higher worlds the individual creates a body that is appropriate to the world in which he shall be living until he takes rebirth also voluntarily\n this experience will train him for even more efficiently making his body when he returns to earth\n sometimes in the subtle worlds an individual takes on a body that is higher than his present evolutionary status and practices living on that level\n this prepares him for a higher level on earth as well\n this is mentioned as taking place even for animals in the forty third chapter of yogananda s autobiography the resurrection of sri yutkeswar\n misidentification the self is verily brahman\n through ignorance it identifies itself with what is alien to it and appears to consist of intellect understanding life sight hearing earth water air ether fire desire and the absence of desire anger and the absence of anger righteousness and the absence of righteousness\n it appears to be all things now one now another\n as a man acts so does he become\n a man of good deeds becomes good a man of evil deeds becomes evil\n a man becomes pure through pure deeds impure through impure deeds\n as a man s desire is so is his destiny\n for as his desire is so is his will as his will is so is his deed and as his deed is so is his reward whether good or bad\n brihadaranyaka upanishad lest in all this we forget that it is really the dream life of the individual spirit yajnavalkya reminds janaka of this\n for in all these changes the self is unchanging in all these births and deaths the self remains birthless and deathless\n the fact that we so easily forget this truth is evidence of how good we are at fooling ourselves we are always masters of the situation\n desire a man acts according to the desires to which he clings\n after death he goes to the next world bearing in his mind the subtle impressions of his deeds and after reaping there the harvest of his deeds he returns again to this world of action\n thus he who has desires continues subject to rebirth\n but he in whom desire is stilled suffers no rebirth\n after death having attained to the highest desiring only the self he goes to no other world\n realizing brahman he becomes brahman\n it is ignorance that causes our mistaken identification but the power behind rebirth is desire\n once we cut off desire rebirth is finished\n desireless we transcend all worlds and know ourselves as eternal brahman\n when all the desires which once entered into his heart have been driven out by divine knowledge the mortal attaining to brahman becomes immortal\n as the slough of a snake lies cast off on an anthill so lies the body of a man at death while he freed from the body becomes one with the immortal spirit brahman the light eternal\n janaka said sir again i give you a yousand cows\n speak on that i may be liberated\n all glory to those that have freed themselves by knowing their self the path of liberation the path yajnavalkya said the path of liberation is subtle and hard and long\n i myself am walking in it nay i have reached the end\n by this path alone the wise the knowers of brahman attain him while living and achieve final liberation at death\n yajnavalkya was obviously no pop yogi with a yoga studio filled with yoga babes in tank tops and leotards confident that yoga would firm up their buttocks eliminate cellulite and give them the kind of body they want or that others will want \n nor was he a traveling sideshow yogi perpetually on tour convincing people that yoga his kind at least was cheap easy fun and sure to make life a breeze\n i know this because of the following statements he has made the path of liberation is subtle\n wiyout refinement of mind and the interior faculties of perception yoga is not going on\n yoga is itself the purification of the mind and heart in order to allow the highest powers of the individual to come into play and transform his life and consciousness\n because this is so patanjali puts ten necessary elements for yoga at the top of his list of the eight limbs of yoga \n ahimsa non violence non injury harmlessness \n satya truthfulness honesty \n asteya non stealing honesty non misappropriativeness \n brahmacharya sexual continence in yought word and deed as well as control of all the senses \n aparigraha non possessiveness non greed non selfishness non acquisitiveness \n shaucha purity cleanliness \n santosha contentment peacefulness \n tapas austerity practical i\n result producing spiritual discipline \n swadhyaya introspective self study spiritual study \n ishwarapranidhana offering of one s life to god\n this is a total overhaul of external and internal life and it is only the beginning of yoga\n the path of liberation is hard\n when confronted with patanjali s list there will be a lot of indignation whining and general complaint\n why because the path of liberation is hard such reaction is proof of that\n only the hardy even really begin the journey and only the toughest and strongest will end it successfully\n this is not a path for the weak and whimsical and it is definitely not a mere body splash a hobby or a free time diversion\n it is the attainment of brahman for god s sake literally \n the path of liberation is long\n it takes lifetimes many if we dawdle and not so many if we knuckle down and go for it\n and believe me those pathetic souls that boast of how they are taking the jet plane route to god while looking and living more like a jet crash do not have a clue\n yes it is possible to realize god in one birth the last birth\n so we need to get busy\n there can be no periods of coasting along deluding ourselves that our liberation is assured and just around the next corner\n real spiritual life goes in a straight line there no bends or curves\n buddha meditated and engaged in intense discipline right up to the moment of his leaving the body even yough he had attained enlightenment decades before\n and so did swami sivananda\n all real yogis do the same\n by this path alone is brahman attained\n and that attainment is not some swell surprise after death\n it takes place right here in this world which is no longer an obstacle to enlightenment\n by changing himself the yogi changes the effect the world has on him\n what hindered him before now helps him\n the once closed door is now open to him\n death is the final going through that door\n for him there will be no return\n no more worlds other worlds there are joyless enveloped in darkness\n to these worlds after death go those who are unwise who know not the self\n any relative world is fundamentally joyless and enveloped in darkness so the truly wise understand\n no world is fit to live in for they are all realms of death and constant change\n there is no peace possible for those who live therein\n but those who know the self have ended that compulsion for when a man has realized the self the pure the immortal the blissful what craving can be left in him that he should take to himself another body full of suffering to sait isfy it desire being the root of rebirth when it is eliminated rebirth vanishes along with it\n in the body he that has once known the glory of the self within the ephemeral body that stumbling block to enlightenment knows that the self is one with brahman lord and creator of all\n brahman may be realized while yet one dwells in the ephemeral body\n to fail to realize him is to live in ignorance and therefore to be subject to birth and death\n the knowers of brahman are immortal others knowing him not continue in the bonds of grief\n brihadaranyaka upanishad the suffering may be very subtle but it will be there nonetheless\n fearless in knowing he who with spiritual eye directly perceives the self effulgent being the lord of all that was is and shall be he indeed is wiyout fear and causes fear in none\n brihadaranyaka upanishad even more he removes fear from others\n this is why we experience such great peace and ease in the presence of enlightened beings\n not only have i experienced this many times i have seen people walk into the presence of a great master and immediately begin shedding tears of relief\n in a moment their anxieties and fears were removed\n he who knows brahman to be the life of life the eye of the eye the ear of the ear the mind of the mind he indeed comprehends fully the cause of all causes\n by the purified mind alone is brahman perceived\n there are no mysteries or puzzles for the knower of brahman\n all is known to him who knows the all\n in brahman there is no diversity\n he who sees diversity goes from death to death\n all our lives are but deaths\n when we really enter into the life that is brahman then birth and death are finished for us\n brahman can be apprehended only as knowledge itself knowledge that is one with reality inseparable from it\n for he is beyond all proof beyond all instruments of yought\n the eternal brahman is pure unborn subtler than the subtlest greater than the greatest\n brihadaranyaka upanishad therefore let therefore the wise aspirant knowing brahman to be the supreme goal so shape his life and his conduct that he may attain to him\n let him not seek to know him by arguments for arguments are idle and vain\n we need only to reshape our life and go directly to god not bothering with critics or nay sayers\n just smile wave and go on to the goal\n know you the journey that i take know you the voyage that i make the joy of it one s heart could break\n no jot of time have i to spare nor will to loiter anywhere so eager am i to be there\n for that the way is hard and long for that gray fears upon it throng i set my journey to a song and it grows wondrous happy so\n singing i hurry on for oh it is to god to god i go\n some final words since there are three short parts remaining to be considered i am putting them in this one closing essay\n the great unborn verily is brahman the great unborn that dwells within the lotus of the heart surrounded by the senses\n he is the intellect of the intellect protector of all king of all lord of all\n good works do not make him more nor do evil works make him less\n lord king protector of all he transcends the three worlds\n devotees seek to know him by study by sacrifice by continence by austerity by detachment\n to know him is to become a seer\n desiring to know him and him alone monks renounce the world\n realizing the glory of the self the sages of old craved not sons nor daughters\n what have we to do with sons and daughters they asked we who have known the self we who have achieved the supreme goal of existence no longer desiring progeny nor wealth nor life in other worlds they entered upon the path of complete renunciation\n craving for progeny leads to craving for wealth and craving for wealth leads to craving for life in other worlds\n two cravings there are the craving for a life of pleasure in this world and the craving for a life of greater pleasure in other worlds\n the self is to be described as not this not that\n it is incomprehensible for it cannot be comprehended undecaying for it never decays unattached for it never attaches itself unfettered for it is never bound\n he who knows the self is unaffected whether by good or by evil\n never do such youghts come to him as i have done an evil thing or i have done a good thing\n both good and evil he has transcended and he is therefore troubled no more by what he may or may not have done\n verily is brahman the great unborn that dwells within the lotus of the heart surrounded by the senses\n the ultimate self of all is brahman that dwells in each sentient being\n it can be said of each of them what saint paul said about jesus in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily\n colossians the difference between jesus and any master and other sentient beings is that he knew the indweller and they do not\n the self is surrounded by the senses like someone in a theater that has a degree screen or like someone seated surrounded by video monitors\n all of us really are in the picture and that is most of our problem\n he is the intellect of the intellect\n every faculty every quality we possess is derived from the self and has its primal archetype in brahman\n this is because everything exists within brahman as an eternal potential\n protector of all king of all lord of all\n the upanishads continually remind us that brahman is transcendent and beyond all qualities or conception\n yet here we see that brahman has an intimate relation with all creation is in contact with all things and controls all things\n brahman is also ishwara the lord\n so it is an error to try to push brahman completely out of the picture and exile it to a void that is antithetical to all we presently know or are\n brahman is indeed both this and that\n in a short while we will be examining a verse that sums this up quite well\n good works do not make him more nor do evil works make him less\n brahman never acts as both the upanishads and the gita insist\n so what does this mean it means that the actions of sentient beings in no way change the self nor do they increase or decrease the presence of the self\n however good actions do help us to perceive the self as present and evil actions dim our mental vision and cause us to lose awareness of the self\n because of that we may think that the self is affected and drawn closer or pushed away but we will be wrong\n reality is untouched and unaffected by our delusions and illusions\n the rest of the verse is quite clear only needing a careful and reflective reading\n the brahman knower the eternal glory of the knower of brahman beginningless and endless revealed by divine knowledge is neither increased nor decreased by deeds\n let a man therefore seek to obtain it since having obtained it he can never be touched by evil\n self controlled is he who knows the self tranquil poised free from desire\n absorbed in meditating upon it he sees it within his own soul and he sees all beings in it\n evil touches him not troubles him not for in the fire of his divine knowledge all evil is burnt away\n freed from evil freed from desire freed from doubt he becomes a knower of brahman\n this o king is the truth of brahman\n do you attain to it janaka said most revered sir i offer you the empire of videha and myself with it to be your servant\n our gratitude for this wisdom should be as boundless and all encompassing as was janaka s\n who can calculate the lives we have passed struggling to comprehend the truth of things before at last these great truths have come into the sphere of our life and become known to us may we now hasten to the realization of yajnavalkya s final summation yajnavalkya said the self the great unborn the undecaying the undying the immortal the fearless is in very truth brahman\n he who knows brahman is wiyout fear\n he who knows brahman becomes brahman that and this the simultaneous immanent and transcendent nature of brahman and the self is not easy to grasp\n but the first half of the following verse is very helpful\n that is the full this is the full\n the full has come out of the full\n if we take the full from the full only the full remains\n om is the ether brahman the eternal ether\n it is the veda known by the knowers of brahman\n for through it one knows what is to be known\n the word translated full is purna which means both full and complete\n in this verse it means the totality of being brahman\n so it tells us that the transcendent nirguna brahman is the total reality but so is the immanent saguna brahman \n the unmanifest is all that is and so is the manifest\n the immanent is a emanation from the transcendent\n if we confine our awareness to the immanent we will find it to be the totality of being\n if we turn to the transcendent and intellectually negate the immanent we will perceive that the transcendent is all\n how is this because they are one and the same\n further brahman cannot be labeled or described so even the words immanent and transcendent cannot be applied to it\n the second verse is extremely significant telling us that om is brahman vibrating eternally in the ether\n that for those who know brahman om is the real veda for it reveals all that is to be known brahman itself\n da da da gods men and asuras all three descendants of prajapati lived with him for a time as students\n then the gods said teach us sir in reply prajapati uttered one syllable da\n then he said have you understood they answered yes we have understood\n you said to us damayata be self controlled\n yes agreed prajapati you have understood\n then the men said teach us sir\n prajapati uttered the same syllable da\n then he said have you understood they answered yes we have understood\n you said to us datta be charitable\n yes agreed prajapati you have understood\n then the asuras said teach us sir\n prajapati uttered the same syllable da\n then he said have you understood they said yes we have understood\n you told us dayadhwam be compassionate\n yes agreed prajapati you have understood\n the storm cloud thunders da da da be self controlled be charitable be compassionate gods men and asuras make up our present human nature\n the gods are the parts of us that are superior to the normal human condition\n they have arisen as we have begun to evolve to the point where we can take the next step up on the evolutionary ladder\n men are our human traits and the asuras are the animal traits that we have brought along with us in our evolutionary journey\n consequently the advice to be self controlled charitable and compassionate applies to us\n and its following will ensure our continued evolution",
    "Brahma": "om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me \n om shaunaka householder of fame once asked bhagavan pippalada of angira s family in this body the divine city of brahman installed how do they create whose glory does this constitute who is he who became all this glory \n unto him shaunaka he pippalada imparted the supreme wisdom of brahman that is prana the atman\n he constitutes the glory of the atman the life of the devas\n he represents both the life and the death of the devas\n that brahman who shines within the divine brahmapura or body as the faultless one devoid of manifested effects self effulgent all pervading he it is who controls the jiva like a spider controlling the king of bees\n just as spiders by means of one thread project and withdraw the web so also the prana who retires drawing back his creation\n prana belongs to the nadis or subtle nerve chords as their devata or indwelling deity\n one in dreamless sleep goes through that state to one s own abode like a falcon and the sky just as a falcon goes to its nest borne on the sky\n he states just as this devadatta in dreamless sleep runs not away even when struck with a stick even so he does not also attach himself to good or evil consequences of the life s ordained activities just as a child enjoys itself spontaneously wiyout motive or desiring fruit even so this devadatta the subject of dreamless sleep enjoys happiness in that state\n he knows being the light supreme\n desiring light he enjoys the light\n so also he returns by the same way to the dream state like a leech just as a leech carries itself on to the other points in front first fixing upon the next point\n and that state which he does not give up for a next one is called the waking state\n he carries all these states within himself just as a vedic deity bears the eight sacrificial cups simultaneously\n it is from him that the source of the vedas and the devas hang like breasts\n in this waking state particularly good and evil obtain for the shining being i\n man s self as ordained\n this being or self is fully self extended into world forms he is the indwelling controller of things and beings he is the bird the crab the lotus he is the purusha the prana the destroyer the cause and the effect the brahman and the atman he is the devata making everything known\n whoever knows all this attains to the transcendent brahman the underlying support the subjective principle\n now this purusha has four seats the navel the heart the throat and the head\n in these shines forth the brahman with four aspects the state of wakefulness of dream of dreamless sleep and the fourth or transcendental state\n in the wakeful state he is brahma in the dreaming state he is vishnu in dreamless sleep he is rudra and the fourth state is the supreme indestructible one and he again is the sun the vishnu the ishwara he is the purusha he the prana he the jive or the animate being he the fire the ishwara and the resplendent yea that brahman which is transcendent shines within all these in itself it is devoid of mind of ears of hands and feet of light\n there neither are the worlds existing nor non existing neither are the vedas or the devas or the sacrifices existing nor non existing neither is the mother or father or daughter in law existing nor non existing neither is chandala s son or pulkasa s son existing nor non existing neither is the mendicant existing nor non existing so neither all the creatures or the ascetics and thus only the one highest brahman shines there\n within the recess of the heart is that akasa of consciousness that with many openings the aim of knowledge within the space of the heart in which all this universe outside evolves and moves about in which all this is warped and woofed as it were \n who knows this knows fully all creation\n there the devas the rishis the pitris have no control for being fully awakened one becomes the knower of all truth\n in the heart the devas live in the heart the pranas are installed in the heart exist the supreme prana and light as also the immanent cause with threefold constituents and the mahat principle\n it exists within this heart that is in the consciousness\n put on the sacrificial thread which is supremely sacred which became manifest of yore with prajapati the first created being himself which embodies longevity eminence and purity and may it be strength and puissance to you \n the enlightened one should discard the external thread putting it off with the sacred tuft of hair on the head the supreme brahman as the all pervading one is the thread and he should put this on\n the sutra or thread is so called because of its having pierced through and started the process of becoming \n this sutra verily constitutes the supreme state\n by whom this sutra is known he is the vipra sage he has reached beyond the vedas\n by it all this universe is transfixed as a collection of gems is stringed together on a thread\n the yogi who is the knower of all yogas and the seer of truth should put on this thread\n established in the state of highest yoga the wise one should put off the external thread\n one who is really self conscious must put on the thread constituted by awareness of brahman\n on account of wearing this sutra or thread they can neither become contaminated nor unclean those namely who have this thread existing within them those with this sacrificial thread of knowledge\n they among men really know the sutra they really wear the sacrificial thread on themselves who are devoted to jnana the highest knowledge who have this jnana for their sacred hair tuft this jnana for their sacred thread\n for them jnana is the greatest purifier jnana that is the best as such\n those who have this jnana for their tufted hair are as non different from it as is fire from its flame\n this wise one is really said to be a shikhi or wearer of the tufted hair while others are mere growers of hair on the head \n but those belonging to the three castes brahmanas kshatriyas and vaisyas who have the right of performing vedic works have to put on this i\n the common sacred thread as surely this thread is ordained to be part of such works\n one who has the jnana for his tufted hair and the same for his sacred thread has everything about him characterised by brahmanahood so know the knowers of the vedas \n this sacred thread of yajna i\n of the all pervading reality is again the purification itself and that which is the end all of vedic works and the wearer of this thread is the wise one is yajna himself as well as the knower of yajna\n the one lord self effulgent in all beings remaining hidden all pervading and the self of all beings controlling and watching over all works good or bad living in all creatures and the witness i\n neither the doer of any acts nor the enjoyer the supreme intelligence the one wiyout a second having no attributes\n the one intelligent active being among the many inactive he who makes the many from what is one the wise men who find out this self theirs is the eternal peace not of others\n having made oneself the arani and the pranava the upper arani and rubbing them together through the practice of meditation see the lord in his hidden reality\n as in the oil in the sesamum seed the butter in the curd water in the flowing waves and fire in the shami wood so is the atman in one s self to be discovered by one who searches for it through truth and austere practice\n as the spider weaves out the web and again withdraws it so the jiva comes out to and goes back again to the wakeful and dreaming states respectively\n the heart i\n the inner chamber of heart resembles the calyx of a lotus full of cavities and also with its face turned downwards\n know that to be the great habitat of the whole universe\n know the wakeful state to have for its centre the eyes the dreaming state should be assigned to the throat the state of dreamless sleep is in the heart and the transcendental state is in the crown of the head\n from the fact of an individual holding his self by means of prajna or spiritual understanding in the supreme self we have what is called sandhya and dhyana as also the worshipping associated with sandhya\n the sandhya by meditation is devoid of any offering of liquids and so also of any exertion of body and speech it is the unifying principle for all creatures and this is really the sandhya for ekadandis\n from which wiyout reaching it the speech falls back with the mind that is the transcendental bliss of this embodied being knowing which the wise one is released from all bondage \n and this bliss is verily the self which pervades the whole universe as the butter diffused within the milk\n this is the brahmopanishad or the supreme wisdom of brahman in the form of a unity of the atman of all founded on the spiritual discipline tapas which is nothing but the vidya or science of the atman\n om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our

we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me \n then ashvalayana approached the lord paramesthi brahma and said teach o lord the knowledge of brahman the highest always cultivated by the good hidden and by which a wise man drives away instantly all the sins and reaches the purusha higher than the high\n and to him the grandsire brahma said know this by means of faith devotion and meditation\n not by work nor by progeny nor by wealth but by renunciation some attained immortality\n higher than heaven seated in the cave buddhi that shines which the self controlled attain the self controlled who being of pure minds have well ascertained the reality by the knowledge of vedanta and through sannyasa or renunciation\n in the sphere of brahma at the time of cosmic dissolution they all get liberated from the highest apparent immortality of the manifested universe\n in a secluded place sitting in an easy posture pure with a neck head and body erect living in the last of the orders of religious life having controlled all the sense saluting his own preceptor with reverence meditating within the lotus of the heart on brahman untainted pure clear and griefless\n who is unthinkable unmanifest of endless forms the good the peaceful immortal the origin of the worlds wiyout beginning middle and end the only one all pervading consciousness and bliss the formless and the wonderful\n meditating on the highest lord allied to uma powerful three eyed blue necked and tranquil the holy man reaches him who is the source of all the witness of all and is beyond darkness i\n he is brahma he is shiva he is indra he is the immutable the supreme the self luminous he alone is vishnu he is prana he is time and fire he is the moon\n he alone is all that was and all that will be the eternal knowing him one transcends death there is no other way to freedom\n seeing the atman in all beings and all beings in the atman one attains the highest brahman not by any other means\n making the atman the lower arani and om the upper arani by the repeated friction of knowledge a wise man burns up the bond\n with his self thus deluded by maya or ignorance it is he who identifies himself with the body and does all sorts of things\n in the waking state it is he the jiva who attains sait isfaction through the varied objects of enjoyment such as women food drink etc\n in the dream state that jiva feels pleasure and pain in a sphere of existence created by his own maya or ignorance\n during the state of profound sleep when everything is dissolved into their causal state he is overpowered by tams or non manifestation and comes to exist in his form of bliss\n again through his connection with deeds done in previous births that very jiva returns to the dream state or the waking state\n the being who sports in the three cities viz\n the states of wakefulness dream and profound sleep from him has sprung up all diversity\n he is the substratum the bliss the indivisible consciousness in whom the three cities dissolve themselves\n from this spring up prana vitality mind all the organs sky air fire water and the earth that supports all\n that which is the supreme brahman the soul of all the great support of the universe subtler than the subtle and eternal that is yourself and you art that\n that which manifests the phenomena such as the states of wakefulness dream and profound sleep i am that brahman realising thus one is liberated from all bonds\n what constitute the enjoyable the enjoyer and the enjoyment in the three abodes different from them all am i the witness the pure consciousness the eternal good\n in me alone is everything born in me does everything rest and in me is everything dissolved\n i am that brahman the secondless\n i am minuter than the minute i am likewise the greatest of all i am the manifold universe\n i am the ancient one the purusha and the ruler i am the effulgent one and the all good\n wiyout arms and legs am i of unthinkable power i see wiyout eyes and i hear wiyout ears\n i know all and am different from all\n none can know me\n i am always the intelligence\n i alone am taught in the various vedas i am the revealer of the vedanta or upanishads and i am also the knower of the vedas\n for me there is neither merit nor demerit i suffer no destruction i have no birth nor any self identity with the body and the organs\n for me there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor air nor ether\n thus realising the paramatman who lies in the cavity of the heart who is wiyout parts and wiyout a second the witness of all beyond both existence and non existence one attains the pure paramatman itself\n he who studies the shatarudriya is purified as by the fires is purified from the sin of drinking purified from the sin of killing a brahmana from deeds done knowingly or unawares\n through this he has his refuge in shiva the supreme self\n one who belongs to the highest order of life should repeat this always or once a day \n by means of this one attains the knowledge that destroys the ocean of samsara or repeated transmigration\n therefore knowing thus one attains the fruit of kaivalya or liberation verily one attains liberation\n om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be

    "Jabala": "om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me brihaspati the preceptor of the gods asked the sage yajnavalkya which is the kurukshetra the famous holy place that destroys sins and protects the good the place where the gods perform sacrifices and which is the abode of brahman in all beings yajnavalkya replied avimukta is the kurukshetra the place where the gods perform sacrifices to deities and which is the abode of brahman in all beings i\n the middle of the eye brows \n hence wherever one goes one shall think thus this is the kurukshetra the place where the gods perform sacrifices to the deities and which is the abode of brahman in all beings\n this is the spot where when the vital airs depart from the living person rudra imparts the mantra taraka brahman to him by which becoming immortal he attains liberation final beatitude \n hence one shall resort to the avimukta shall not desert the avimukta\n brihaspati approved of the statement saying so it is yajnavalkya verily it is so o revered one it is so yajnavalkya \n thereafter the sage atri son of the creator brahma asked of yajnavalkya how am i to realize the self which is infinite and unmanifest to this yajnavalkya replied that avimukta lord siva as the redeemer is to be worshipped the self which is infinite and unmanifest is established in i\n is non different from the avimukta in ishvara possessed of attributes \n which is that place where avimukta is established he is established in between varana and nasi \n what is meant by varana and what by nasi the varana is so called as it wards off all the faults committed by the ten organs of perception and action \n the nasi is so named as it destroys all sins committed by the ten organs\n the place between the varana and the nasi is the meeting place of the upper part of the nose and the centre of the eye brows \n which is the seat of that avimukta that which is the well known juncture of the eye brows and the nose is the juncture of heaven in the form of the crown of the head and this world in the form at the end of the chin \n the knowers of the veda worship indeed this juncture samadhi as sandhya in their daily worship \n that avimukta is to be worshipped\n he who knows this thus the true nature of the avimukta imparts the wisdom of the avimukta that the individual self is no other than the attributeless brahman to his disciples \n then the discipline students brahmacharins of yajnavalkya asked him pray tell us what is that mantra by reciting which one attains immortality he replied by reciting satarudriya \n these mantras are indeed the names of rudra to achieve immortality\n by reciting these mantras one becomes immortal\n then janaka the king of the videhas respectfully approached yajnavalkya and requested him revered sir expound to me the tenets of renunciation sannyasa \n he yajnavalkya then replied after completing the period of disciplined studentship brahmaacharya one may become a householder\n after being a householder he may become a forest dweller i\n having become a vanaprastha he may renounce the world and thus become a mendicant monk \n or alternately he may embrace renunciation from brahmaacharya itself or from the stage of a householder or from the forest life of a vanaprastha \n it can also be that a person may renounce worldly life that very day on which distaste for it dawns on him whether he is one not observing the vows before the stage of renunciation or observe them whether he has undergone the prescribed ablution on completing the disciplined studentship or not whether he is one who has discontinued maintaining the sacred fire at the death of his wife utsannagni or is one who does not maintain for other causes the sacred fire anagnika \n some law givers prescribe the sacrifice called prajapatya of which the god brahma is the presiding deity to a twice born before he embraces renunciation \n but yough thus laid down he may not do so\n he shall only perform the sacrifice in which agni is the deity\n for agni is the vital breath prana \n thereby he does strengthen the vital breath\n he shall then perform the traidhataviya sacrifice\n for the three forms of agni in him namely sattva rajas and tamas are strengthened by this sacrifice\n having performed the sacrifice he shall smell the smoke of the holy fire reciting the following mantra o fire this vital breath is your source as you are born from sutratman at the proper time you shine forth\n knowing him the atman your ultimate source may you merge in him \n may you increase our wealth here the transcendent knowledge \n verily this is the source of fire namely the vital air\n so what is said by this mantra is may you go unto your source \n having procured the holy fire from the house of a well versed vedic scholar in the village he shall smell the holy dire as described previously\n if he is unable to procure the holy fire he shall offer the oblations in water\n for water is verily all the gods\n reciting i offer the oblation to all the gods svaha he shall tender the oblation and picking up a small portion of the offered oblation which is mixed with ghee he shall eat it as this is beneficial\n the mantra of liberation namely om is the essence of the three vedas this he shall realize\n it is brahman and it is to be worshipped\n indeed so it is o revered yajnavalkya said janaka \n then the sage atri asked yajnavalkya may i ask you yajnavalkya how is one wiyout the sacred thread a brahmana yajnavalkya replied the conviction i am the self alone is his sacred thread\n he shall then sip water ceremoniously thrice \n this is the method enjoined on those who renounce worldly life \n in the case of kshatriyas and others not entitled to renunciation they may seek liberation in the path of the brave who court death in the battle field or fast unto death as a discipline or enter into water to rise no more or enter fire to be burnt to ashes or undertake the great journey in which they collapse by exhaustion \n then in the case of those entitled to renunciation the mendicant monk wearing ochre coloured garment with shaven head accepting nothing excepting food for bare sustenance being pure injuring none in yought word and deed austerity living on alms becomes fit for realizing brahman\n if sorely afflicted by disease etc\n he may renounce the world by mental resolve or by spoken words uttering mantras\n this way of renunciation has been prescribed by brahma the creator in the vedanta the ascetic the sannyasin who has renounced the world following this path realizes brahman\n thus indeed it is o revered yajnavalkya appreciated janaka \n there are sages called paramahamsas as in the days of yore the sages samvartaka aruni svetaketu durvasas ribhu nidagha jadabharata dattatreya raivataka and others wearing no distinguishing marks with conduct beyond the ken of worldly people and who behaved as yough bereft of their senses yough perfectly sane\n discarding all these namely the threefold staff of bamboo the water pot the sling to carry personal effects the alms bowl the cloth for purifying water tied to the staff tuft of hair and sacred thread in water i\n a reservoir by reciting bhuh svaha the paramahamsa shall seek the atman\n possessing a form as one just born i\n unclad unaffected by the pairs of opposites such as heat and cold pleasure and pain accepting nothing except bare sustenance well established in the path of the truth of brahman of pure mind receiving alms into the mouth literally into the vessel of the belly at the prescribed hour in order to sustain life becoming equanimous at gain or loss of alms sheltering himself wiyout an abode of his own in an unoccupied house a temple a clump of tall grass or a heap of straw an anthill the shade of a tree a potter s hut a cottage where sacred fire is kept sandy bank of a river a mountain thicket or cavity a hollow in a tree the vicinity of a water fall or a piece of clean ground making no efforts in any kind of gainful activity free from mineness i\n a sense of possessiveness ever meditating on brahman devoted to the self ever intent on eradication of the good and bad karman the sage finally gives up his body in the state of renunciation such a sage is indeed a paramahamsa\n thus ends the upanishad\n om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the jabalopanishad belonging to the sukla yajur veda",
    "Svetasva": "om may brahman protect us both together\n may he nourish us both together\n may we both work together with great energy\n may our study be vigorous and effective\n may we not hate each other\n om peace peace peace students of brahman i\n the vedas discuss among themselves what is the cause is it brahman whence are we born why do we live where is our final rest under whose orders are we who know the brahman subjected to the law of happiness and misery time nature law chance matter energy intelligence neither these nor combination of these can bear examination because of their own birth identity and the existence of the self\n the self also is not a free agent being under the sway of happiness and misery\n pracit ising the method of meditation they realized that being who is the god of religion the self of philosophy and the energy of science who exists as the self luminous power in everyone who is the source of the intellect emotions and will who is one wiyout a second who presides over all the causes enumerated above beginning with time and ending with the individual soul and who had been incomprehensible because of the limitations of their own intellect\n we think of him as the universe resembling a wheel which has one felly with a triple tyre sixteen extremities fifty spokes twenty counter spokes and six sets of eight which is driven along three different roads by means of a belt that is single yet manifold and which each revolution gives rise to two\n we think of him in his manifestation as the universe who is like a river that contains the waters of five streams that has five big turnings due to five causes that has the five pranas for the waves the mind the basis of five fold perception for the source and the five fold misery for its rapids and that has five whirlpools five branches and innumerable aspects\n in this infinite wheel of brahman in which everything lives and rests the pilgrim soul is whirled about\n knowing the individual soul hitherto regarded as separate to be itself the moving force and blessed by him it attains immortality\n this is expressly declared to be the supreme brahman\n in that is the triad\n it is the firm support and it is the imperishable\n knowing the inner essence of this the knowers of veda become devoted to brahman merge themselves in it and are released from birth\n the lord supports this universe which consists of a combination of the perishable and the imperishable the manifest and the unmanifest\n as long as the self does not know the lord it gets attached to worldly pleasures and is bound but when it knows him all fetters fall away from it\n the conscious subject and the unconscious object the master and the dependent are both unborn\n she too who is engaged in bringing about the relation of the enjoyer and the enjoyed or between these two is unborn\n when all these three are realized as brahman the self becomes infinite universal and free from the sense of agentship\n matter is perishable but god is imperishable and immortal\n he the only god rules over the perishable matter and individual souls\n by meditating on him by uniting with him and by becoming one with him there is cessation of all illusion in the end\n with the knowledge of god all fetters fall off\n with the waning of ignorance birth and death cease\n going beyond the consciousness of the body by meditating on him one reaches the third state viz\n all his desires are sait isfied and he becomes one wiyout a second\n this is to be known as eternally existing in one s own self\n indeed there is nothing to be known beyond this\n as a result of meditation the enjoyer the enjoyed and the power which brings about the enjoyment all are declared to be the three aspects of brahman\n fire is not perceived in its source the fire stick till it is ignited by percussion\n the subtle essence of fire nevertheless is not absent in the stick for fire can be obtained from the source the fire stick by striking again\n the state of the atman before and after realization \n by meditating on the pranava the atman is perceived manifestly in the body but it was there in a latent state even before realization \n making one s own body the lower piece of wood and the pranava the upper piece of wood and pracit ising churning in the form of meditation one should realize god as one would find out something hidden\n as oil in sesame seeds as butter in curds as water in underground springs as fire in wood even so this self is perceived in the self\n he who by means of truthfulness self control and concentration looks again and again for this self which is all pervading like butter contained in milk and which is rooted in self knowledge and meditation he becomes that supreme brahman the destroyer of ignorance\n first harnessing the mind and the senses with a view to realizing the truth and then having found out the light of the fire the evolving soul brought itself out of the earth\n with our minds controlled so as to manifest the self luminous immanent soul we shall vigorously endeavour for the attainment of supreme bliss\n controlling the heaven aspiring senses with the help of the mind and the intellect the immanent soul so regenerates them as to enable them to manifest the self luminous infinite light\n great is the glory of the immanent soul who is all pervading all knowing infinite and selfluminous\n only those rare few who know undergo the necessary discipline and spiritual practices\n the wise do indeed control the activities of the intellect and pracit ise meditation and concentration\n following only in the footsteps of the wise i merge you both in the ancient brahman by continued meditation\n may the glorious one manifest himself may the sons of immortal bliss hearken to me even they who occupy celestial regions where fire is churned out where air is controlled where soma juice overflows there the mind attains perfection\n attaining whom you destroyest the source and art no more troubled by the results of past actions to that ancient brahman be you devoted through the prime cause the immanent soul\n placing the body in a straight posture holding the chest throat and head erect and drawing the senses and the mind into the heart the knowing one should cross over all the fearful currents by means of the raft of brahman\n controlling the senses with an effort and regulating the activities in the body one should breathe out through the nostrils when the vital activities become gentle\n then the knowing one wiyout being in the least distracted should keep his hold on the mind as on the reins attached to restive horses\n one should perform one s exercises in concentration resorting to caves and such other pure places helpful to its practice places where the ground is level wiyout pebbles and the scenery pleasing to the eyes where there is no wind dust fire dampness and disturbing noises\n forms that appear like snow smoke sun wind fire fire fly lightning crystal and moon precede the manifestation of brahman in yoga practice\n when the fivefold perception of yoga arising from concentrating the mind on earth water light air and ether have appeared to the yogin then he has become possessed of a body made of the fire of yoga and he will not be touched by disease old age or death\n it is said that the first signs of entering yoga are lightness of body health thirstlessness of mind clearness of complexion a beautiful voice an agreeable odour and scantiness excretions\n just as the same metal disc which was stained by dust before shines brilliantly when cleaned so the embodied being seeing the truth of atman realizes oneness attains the goal and becomes sorrowless\n when the yogin realizes the truth of brahman through the perception of the truth of atman in this body as a self luminous entity then knowing the divinity as unborn eternal and free from all the modifications of prakriti he is freed from all sins\n this divinity pervades all directions in their entirety\n he is the first born hiranyagarbha \n he has entered into the womb\n he alone is born and is to be born in future\n he is inside all persons as the indwelling self facing all directions\n salutations to that divinity who is in the fire who is in the water who is in the plants who is in the trees who has pervaded the whole universe\n it is the self same one who exists alone at the time of creation and dissolution of the universe that assumes manifold powers and appears as the divine lord by virtue of his inscrutable power of maya\n he it is that protects all the worlds and controls all the various forces working therein\n those who realize this being becomes immortal\n he who protects and controls the worlds by his own powers he rudra is indeed one only\n there is no one beside him who can make him the second\n o men he is present inside the hearts of all beings\n after projecting and maintaining all the worlds he finally withdraws them into himself\n though god the creator of heaven and earth is one only yet heaven is the real owner of all the eyes faces hands and feet in this universe\n it is heaven who inspires them all to do their respective duties in accordance with the knowledge past actions and tendencies of the various beings with whom they appear to be associated \n may heaven who created the gods and supports them who is the origin also of the cosmic soul who confers bliss and wisdom on the devotes destroying their sins and sorrows and punishing all breaches of law may heaven the great seer and the lord of all endow us with good youghts\n o lord who blesses all creatures by revealing the vedas deign to make us happy by thy calm and blissful self which roots out terror as well as sin\n o revealer of the vedic truths deign to make propitious that arrow which thou holdest in thy hand for shooting at somebody\n o protector of devotees do not destroy that benign personal form of thine which has manifested as the universe\n higher than this personal brahman is the infinite supreme brahman who is concealed in all beings according to their bodies and who yough remaining single envelops the whole universe\n knowing him to be the lord one becomes immortal\n i have realized this great being who shines effulgent like the sun beyond all darkness\n one passes beyond death only on realizing him\n there is no other way of escape from the circle of births and deaths\n there is naught higher than or different from him naught greater or more minute than him\n rooted in his own glory he stands like a tree one wiyout a second and immovable\n by that being the whole universe is filled\n that being is far beyond this world is formless and free from misery\n they who know this become immortal\n but all others have indeed to suffer misery alone\n therefore that divine lord being all pervading omnipresent and benevolent dwells in the hearts of all beings and makes use of all faces heads and necks in this world\n this self is indeed the mighty lord\n he is the imperishable internal light that controls everything\n he guides the intellect of all beings so as to enable them to gain that extremely pure state of mukti \n assuming a form of the size of a thumb by virtue of intellect emotion imagination and will the infinite being dwells in the hearts of creatures as their inner self\n those who realize this become immortal\n that infinite being has a yousand heads a yousand eyes and a yousand feet enveloping the whole universe on all sides\n he exists beyond ten fingers\n that which is that which was and that which is yet to be all this is nothing but this infinite being\n though he grows beyond his own nature into the form of the objective universe he still remains the lord of immortality\n with hands and feet everywhere with eyes heads and mouths everywhere with ears everywhere that exists pervading everything in the universe\n they realize him as shining by the functions of all the senses yet wiyout the senses as the lord of all the ruler of all the refuge of all and the friend of all\n it is he who resides in the body the city of nine gates\n he is the soul that sports in the outside world\n he is the master of the whole world animate and inanimate\n wiyout hands and feet he goes fast and grasps wiyout eyes he sees wiyout ears he hears\n he knows whatever is to be known yet there is none who knows him\n they say he is the foremost the great infinite being\n subtler than even the subtlest and greater than the greatest the atman is concealed in the heart of the creature\n by the grace of the creator one becomes free from sorrows and desires and then realizes him as the great lord\n i know this undecaying primeval immanent self of all who is omnipresent because of his allpervasiveness and whom the expounders of brahman declare to be eternally free from birth\n may that divine being who yough himself colourless gives rise to various colours in different ways with the help of his own power for his own inscrutable purpose and who dissolves the whole world in himself in the end may he endow us with good youghts that itself is the fire that is the sun that is the air that is the moon that is also the starry firmament that is the brahman that is the waters that is prajapati\n thou art the woman thou art the man thou art the youth and the maiden too\n thou art the old man who totters along leaning on the staff\n thou art born with faces turned in all directions\n thou art the dark blue butterfly and the green parrot with red eyes\n thou art the thunder cloud the seasons and the oceans\n thou art wiyout beginning and beyond all time and space\n thou art he from whom all the worlds are born\n there is a single female of red white and black colours who is unoriginated and who produces numerous offsprings resembling herself\n by her side lies one unborn male out of attachment for her while another male also unoriginated forsakes her after having enjoyed her\n two birds of beautiful plumage who are inseparable friends reside on the self same tree\n of these one eats the fruits of the tree with relish while the other looks on wiyout eating\n sitting on the same tree the individual soul gets entangled and feels miserable being deluded on account of his forgetting his divine nature\n when he sees the other the lord of all whom all devotees worship and realizes that all greatness is his then he is relieved of his misery\n of what avail are the vedas to him who does not know that indestructible highest ethereal being in whom the gods and the vedas reside only those who know that are sait isfied\n the lord of maya projects the vedas sacrifices spiritual practices past and future religious observances all that the vedas declare and the whole world including ourselves\n the other again is bound by maya in this\n know then that nature is maya and that the great god is the lord of maya\n the whole world is filled with beings who form his parts\n one attains infinite peace on realizing that self effulgent adorable lord the bestower of blessings who yough one presides over all the various aspects of prajapati and in whom this universe dissolves and in whom it appears in manifold forms\n may he who created the gods and supports them who witnessed the birth of the cosmic soul who confers bliss and wisdom on the devoted destroying their sins and sorrows and punishing all breaches of law may he the great seer and the lord of all endow us with good youghts let us offer our worship with oblations to that blissful divine being who is the lord of the devas who governs the bipeds and the quadrupeds and in whom the worlds rest\n one attains infinite peace when one realizes that blissful one who is subtler than the subtlest who creates the world in the midst of chaos who assumes various forms and who is the only one that encompasses the universe\n he alone is the protector of the world at the proper time\n he is the lord of the universe hidden in all creatures\n in him the divine sages and the gods merge themselves\n realizing him thus one cuts asunder the fetters of death\n one is released from all fetters on realizing the blissful one who encompasses the world and who hides himself in all beings in an extremely subtle form as the essence finer than ghee\n this divinity who created the universe and who pervades everything always dwells in the hearts of creatures being finitized by emotions intellect will and imagination\n those who realize this become immortal\n when ignorance is dispelled there is neither day nor night neither being nor non being\n there is only that auspicious one who is imperishable and who is woryour of being adored by the creator\n from him has proceeded the ancient wisdom\n no one can grasp him above or across or in the middle\n there is none equal to him whose name is great glory\n his form does not stand within the range of the senses\n no one perceives him with the eye\n those who know him through the faculty of intuition as thus seated in their heart become immortal\n some being afraid approach thee thinking that thou art the unborn\n o rudra deign to protect me with that benevolent face of thine\n injure us not in respect of children grand children and life nor in respect of cows and horses\n do not destroy our heroes in thy anger o rudra\n we invoke thee always with offerings\n ignorance leads to the perishable\n wisdom leads to immortality\n entirely different from these is he the imperishable infinite secret supreme brahman in whom exists wisdom as well as ignorance and who governs them both\n he alone presides over nature in all aspect and controls every form and every cause of production\n he witnesses the birth of the first born seer of golden colour and nourishes him with wisdom\n differentiating each genus into its species and each species into its members the supreme being withdraws them once more into their own ground\n again bringing forth the agents of creation the great self holds sway over them all\n just as the sun shines lighting up all space above below and across even so does that one adorable god the repository of all goodness and greatness preside over everything that has the nature of a cause\n he who is the one source of the world brings out everything out of his own nature and leads creatures to perfection according to their deserts and endows each being with its distinguishing characteristic\n thus he presides over the whole universe\n he lies hidden in the upanishads which form the essence of the vedas\n him the hiranyagarbha knows as the source of himself and the vedas\n those gods and seers who realized him in former days became identified with him and verily became immortal\n only he who gets attached to the pleasurable qualities of things does work for the sake of its fruits and enjoys the fruits of his own deeds\n though really the master of the senses he becomes bound by the three gunas and assuming various forms wanders about through the three paths as a result of his own deeds\n subtle as the point of a goad and pure effulgent and infinite like the sun he alone is seen assuming as another the size of a thumb on account of the finiteness of the heart in which he appears and associating himself with egoism and sankalpa on account of the limitations of the intellect\n that individual soul is as subtle as a hairpoint divided and sub divided hundreds of times\n yet he is potentially infinite\n he has to be known\n he is neither female nor male nor neuter\n whatever body he assumes he becomes identified with that\n by desire contact sight and delusion the embodied soul assumes successively various forms in various places according to his deeds just as the body grows nourished by showers of food and drink\n the embodied self chooses many forms gross and subtle based on the qualities belonging to himself to the actions and to the mind\n the cause of their combination is found to be still another\n realizing him who is wiyout beginning or end who creates the cosmos in the midst of chaos who assumes many forms and who alone envelops everything one becomes free from all fetters\n that supreme divinity who created both life and matter who is the source of all arts and sciences who can be intuited by a pure and devoted mind realizing him the blissful the incorporeal and the nameless one is freed from further embodiment\n some deluded thinkers speak of nature and others of time as the force that revolves this wheel of brahman\n but really all this is only the glory of god manifested in the world\n it should be known that energy assumes various forms such as earth water light air and ether at the command of him who is the master of gunas and the maker of time who is omniscient who is pure consciousness itself and by whom all this is ever enveloped\n after setting the creation in motion and withdrawing himself from it he unites the principle of spirit with the principle of matter with one with two with three and with eight through the mere instrumentality of time and their own inherent properties\n he gives the start to the creation associated with the three gunas of nature and others all things\n again in the absence of the gunas he destroys all created objects and after destruction remains aloof in his essence\n by previously meditating as seated in one s own heart on that adorable being who appears as the universe and who is the true source of all creatures he can be perceived even yough he is the primeval cause of the union of spirit with matter as well as the partless entity transcending the three divisions of time\n knowing him who is the origin and dissolution of the universe the source of all virtue the destroyer of all sins the master of all good qualities the immortal and the abode of the universe as seated in one s own self he is perceived as different from and transcending the tree of samsara as well as time and form\n may we realize him the transcendent and adorable master of the universe who is the supreme lord over all the lords the supreme god above all the gods and the supreme ruler over all the rulers\n his has nothing to achieve for himself nor has he any organ of action\n no one is seen equal or superior to him\n his great power alone is described in the vedas to be of various kinds and his knowledge strength and action are described as inherent in him\n no one in the world is his master nor has anybody any control over him\n there is no sign by which he can be inferred\n he is the cause of all and the ruler of individual souls\n he has no parent nor is there any one who is his lord\n may the supreme being who spontaneously covers himself with the products of nature just as a spider does with the threads drawn from its own navel grant us absorption in brahman god who is one only is hidden in all beings\n he is all pervading and is the inner self of all creatures\n he presides over all actions and all beings reside in him\n he is the witness and he is the pure consciousness free from the three gunas of nature\n those wise men who ever feel in their own hearts the presence of him who is the one ruler of the inactive many and who makes the one seed manifold to them belongs eternal happiness and to none else\n he is the eternal among the eternal and the intelligent among all that are intelligent\n though one he grants the desires of the many\n one is released from all fetters on realizing him the cause of all who is comprehensible through philosophy and religious discipline\n the sun does not shine there neither the moon nor the stars\n there these lightnings shine not how then this fire because he shines everything shines after him\n by his light all this shines\n the one destroyer of ignorance in the midst of this universe he alone is the fire which is stationed in water\n realizing him alone one overcomes death\n there is no other path for emancipation\n he is the creator of everything as well as the knower of everything\n he is his own source he is all knowing and he is the destroyer of time\n he is the repository of all good qualities and the master of all sciences\n he is the controller of matter and spirit and the lord of the gunas\n he is the cause of liberation from the cycle of birth and death and of bondage which results in its continuance\n he is the soul of the universe he is immortal and his is the rulership\n he is the all knowing the all pervading the protector of the universe the eternal ruler\n none else is there efficient to govern the world eternally\n he who at the beginning of creation projected brahma universal consciousness who delivered the vedas unto him who constitutes the supreme bridge of immortality who is the partless free from actions tranquil faultless taintless and resembles the fire that has consumed its fuel seeking liberation i go for refuge to that effulgent one whose light turns the understanding towards the atman\n only when men shall roll up the sky like a skin will there be an end of misery for them wiyout realizing god\n himself realizing brahman by the power of self control and concentration of mind as well as by the grace of god the sage svetasvatara expounded well to the highest order of sannyasins the truth of that supremely holy brahman resorted to by all the seers\n this highest mysticism expounded in the vedanta in a former age should not be taught to one whose passions have not been subdued nor to one who is not a woryour son nor to an unworyour disciple\n these truths when taught shine forth only in that high souled one who has supreme devotion to god and an equal degree of devotion to the spiritual teacher\n they shine forth in that high souled one only\n om may brahman protect us both together\n may he nourish us both together\n may we both work together with great energy\n may our study be vigorous and effective\n may we not hate each other\n om peace peace peace here ends the svetasvataropanishad included in the krishna yajur veda",
    "Hamsa": "om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me \n gautama addressed sanatkumara thus o lord you art the knower of all dharmas and art well versed in all shastras pray tell me the means by which i may obtain a knowledge of brahma vidya\n sanatkumara replied thus hear o gautama that tattva as expounded by parvati after inquiring into all dharmas and ascertaining shiva s opinion\n this treait ise on the nature of hamsa which gives the fruit of bliss and salvation and which is like a treasure to the yogin is a very mystic science and should not be revealed to the public \n now we shall explain the true nature of hamsa and paramahamsa for the benefit of a brahmacharin a seeker after brahman or celibate who has his desires under control is devoted to his guru and always contemplates as hamsa and realise thus it hamsa is permeating all bodies like fire or heat in all kinds of wood or oil in all kinds of gingelly seeds\n having known it thus one does not meet with death\n having contracted the anus with the heels pressed against it having raised the vayu breath from mula adhara chakra having made circuit thrice round svadhisthana having gone to manipuraka having crossed anahata having controlled prana in visuddhi and then having reached ajna one contemplates in brahmarandhra in the head and having meditated there always i am of three matras cognises his self and becomes formless\n the sisna penis has two sides left and right from head to foot \n this is that paramahamsa supreme hamsa or higher self having the resplendence of crores of suns and by whom all this world is pervaded\n if this hamsa which has buddhi as vehicle has eight fold vritti\n when it is in the eastern petal there is the inclination in a person to virtuous actions in the south eastern petal there arise sleep laziness etc\n in the southern there is the inclination to cruelty in the south western there is the inclination to sins in the western there is the inclination to sensual sport in the north western there arise the desire of walking and others in the northern there arises the desire of lust in the north eastern there arises the desire of amassing money in the middle or the inter spaces between the petals there is the indifference to material pleasures\n in the filament of the lotus there arises the waking state in the pericarp there arises the svapna dreaming state in the bija seed of pericarp there arises the sushupti dreamless sleeping state when leaving the lotus there is the turya fourth state \n when hamsa is absorbed in nada spiritual sound the state beyond the fourth is reached\n nada which is at the end of sound and beyond speech and mind is like a pure crystal extending from mula adhara to brahmarandhra\n it is that which is spoken of as brahma and paramatman\n here is the performance of ajapa gayatri is given now hamsa is the rishi the metre is avyakta gayatri paramahamsa is the devata or presiding deity ham is the bija sa is the sakti so ham is the kilaka wedge \n thus there are six\n there are hamsas or breaths in a day and night\n salutation to surya soma niranjana the stainless and nirabhasa the universeless \n may the bodiless and subtle one guide or illuminate my understanding \n vaushat to agni soma\n then anganyasas and karanyasas occur or should be performed after the mantras as they are performed before the mantras in the heart and other seats \n having done so one should contemplate upon hamsa as the atman in his heart\n agni and soma are its wings right and left sides omkara is its head ukara and bindu are the three eyes and face respectively rudra and rudrani or rudra s wife are the feet kanthata or the realisation of the oneness of jivatma or hamsa the lower self with paramatman or paramahamsa the higher self is done in two ways samprajnata and asamprajnata \n after that unmani is the end of the ajapa mantra \n having thus reflected upon manas by means of this hamsa one hears nada after the uttering of this japa mantra a crore of times\n it nada is begun to be heard as of ten kinds\n the first is chini like the sound of that word the second is chinichini the third is the sound of bell the fourth is that of conch the fifth is that of tantiri lute the sixth is that sound of tala cymbals the seventh is that of flute the eighth is that of bheri drum the ninth is that of mridanga double drum and the tenth is that of clouds viz\n he may experience the tenth wiyout the first nine sounds through the initiation of a guru \n in the first stage his body becomes chini chini in the second there is the bhanjana breaking or affecting in the body in the third there is the bhedana piercing in the fourth the head shakes in the fifth the palate produces saliva in the sixth nectar is attained in the seventh the knowledge of the hidden things in the world arises in the eighth para vak is heard in the ninth the body becomes invisible and the pure divine eye is developed in the tenth he attains para brahman in the presence of or with atman which is brahman\n after that when manas destroyed when it which is the source of sankalpa and vikalpa disappears owing to the destruction of these two and when virtues and sins are burnt away then he shines as sadashiva of the nature of sakti pervading everywhere being effulgence in its very essence the immaculate the eternal the stainless and the most quiescent om\n thus is the teaching of the vedas and thus is the upanishad\n om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n

sacrificial fires and the holy thread his works his wife and all else that he may possess\n sannyasins enter a village for begging purposes only with their palms or their stomach as the receptacle for food\n uttering om om om they should mentally place this mantra the upanishad in the different parts of their body\n he who realises the truth in this manner is really the wise one\n he who knows this

also the ultimate god and it is also the lord of all things\n rudra is called the personification of pranva because he sends the souls towards heaven at the time of death dissolution \n he is called the one who has the shape of pranava because the brahmins read and propagate the rik yajur sama and atharva vedas only after reading om \n he is called all pervading because like oil in gingili til he peacefully pervades all over the world and its beings from top to bottom and from right to left\n he is called anantha endless because his end is neither at the top nor bottom nor right nor left\n he is called thara protector because he protects one from the fear of life which consists of the fear of staying in the womb fear at time of birth fear from diseases fear from old age and fear from death\n he is called shukla white seminal fluid because by pronouncing his name we get rid of all pains\n he is called sookshma minute because he pervades in a minute form all over the body wiyout touching any of the organs\n he is called vaidhyutha electric because as soon as his name is pronounced in the state of darkness where nothing is visible the holy knowledge comes like a ray of lightning\n he is called para brahmam the ultimate reality because yough he is inside every thing he is in and out of everything he is the refuge of every thing and bigger than the big he is inside every thing\n he is called eka single because he singly destroys everything and recreates everything\n he is called yourtha sacred water because he is the ultimate mingling of all sacred waters which are sought after in the east south north ad west\n he is eka loner because he creates all beings and travels within them alone wiyout any one realizing where he comes from and where he goes\n he is rudra because he is fast moving form is not understood by all but only by great sages and devotees\n he is eeshana because by his power for creation and upkeep and also because he rules over all devas gods \n like approaching a cow for getting milk we come to you\n you are eeshana because veda points you out as one who shows the heaven and one who rules over other gods\n you are also called maheswara great lord because you bless your devotees by giving them knowledge because you created words and brought out knowledge and because you have forsaken everything and reached a highest state of existence through yoga and your grace\n this is the story of rudra\n this god is the one who pervades in all directions\n he is the one who came earlier than every thing\n he is the one who is in the womb\n he is the one who is in all the creatures which have come out till now and all those who are going to be created in future\n he is also the one who sees the inside but the one who has a face which looks outside\n rudra is one and only one\n there is none second to him\n he rules all worlds by his power\n he pervades fully in all beings\n he is the one who at the time of deluge absorbs all beings\n he is the one who creates all beings and upkeeps them\n he alone exists in all organs where birth takes place\n he travels among all beings and is the reason for their existence\n the seeker would get immeasurable peace by searching and surrendering to this god who gives everything to the one who asks and who is praiseworyour\n he converts fire air water earth ether and everything that exists here in to ash\n he who sees this and mentally realizes it and observes the penance to pasupathi lord of all beings and who coats ash all over his body with this ash attains the state of brahman\n by worshipping pasupathi lord of all beings like this the ties of bondage of all beings get cut and they attain salvation\n there is none greater than him on whom all the worlds are strung like beads\n over ages nothing so far where greater than him and nothing is going to be greater than him\n he has yousands of legs but one and only one head\n he pervades every where\n from akshara letter language the deathless being time is created\n from time ages the all pervasiveness is created\n this all pervasiveness is rudra\n rudra destroys beings even when he is sleeping\n from his breath is produced the power of thamas darkness \n from thamas is created water\n mixing this water with finger makes it cold\n by mixing the coolness the foam is produced\n from that foam the galaxy is produced\n from the galaxy brahmam is produced\n from brahmam air is produced\n from air the sound of om is produced\n from the sound of om savithri is produced\n from savithri gayathri is produced and from gayathri all the worlds are produced\n they who worship penance and truth get permanent happiness\n worshipping that brahmam which is the mixture of light water essence and nectar by chanting om bhoor bhuva swarom is the greatest penance\n om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the

    "Atharvasikha": "om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me i meditate on that ultimate truth which explains the meaning of the sound of om which shines as the fourth leg of om which is thureeya of thureeyas a super divine state of oneness with god which is beyond the three states of wakefulness sleep and dream which enjoys being in three legs syllables and which is one and only one\n om the sages pippalada aangiras and sanath kumara approached the great god like sage atharva maharshi and asked him oh god like sage what is the chief aspect of meditation what is the mantra holy syllable on which to meditate who can meditate who is the god of meditation \n the sage atharva replied to them mainly meditation has to be done on the single letter om\n it itself is the mantra for meditation\n the four legs of that mantra are the four devas and the four vedas\n the letter has to be recognized as the para brahman ultimate reality and meditated upon\n the first syllable aa indicates earth the rig veda along with its holy chants brahma the creator ashta vasus among devas gayathry among meters and garhapyoura the fire of the household among fires\n the second syllable uu denotes the ether the yajur veda rudra who is the god of destruction the eleven rudras among devas trishgup among meters and dakshinagni fire of the south funeral pyre among the fires\n the third syllable ma indicates the heavens sama veda with its musical sounds of sama vishnu who looks after the worlds the twelve adiyouras suns among devas jagathichanda among meters and ahavagni the fire used in fire sacrifice among the fires\n that half fourth syllable which is the hidden ma is the magical chants of atharva veda samvarthaka the fire of exchange fire among fires marud ganas among devas\n it is the self glittering brahman which shines alone and sees everything\n the first is the red brahma creative aspect the second the holy white rudra destructive aspect the third the black lord vishnu the administrative aspect and the fourth which is like lightning is the multi coloured purushothama best among males \n this omkara has four legs and four heads fires \n the fourth is the half syllable sound of ma which is hidden\n that is pronounced in a small short form slightly extended form pluyouraga and much extended form\n it is pronounced as om with one mathra om in two mathras and om in the extended three mathras mathra is the unit of pronunciation \n the fourth peaceful half syllable is hidden in the long ended pronunciation\n it is the incomparable glitter of the soul\n it is that sound which was never there and which will be never there\n if not pronounced earlier but pronounced for the first time it takes one via the sushumna nadi to the lotus with yousand petals sahasrara \n the pranava the sound of om makes all the souls to bow before it\n it is the one and only one which has to be meditated upon as the four vedas and the birth place of all devas\n one who meditates like that goes away from all sorrows and fears and gets the power to protect all others who approach him\n it is because of this meditation only that lord vishnu who is spread every where wins over all others\n it is because lord brahma controlled all his organs and meditated upon it he attained the position of the creator\n even lord vishnu parks his mind in the sound om of the place of paramathma ultimate soul and meditates upon eeshana who is most proper to be worshipped\n all this is only proper in case of eeshana\n brahma vishnu rudra and indra are creating all beings all organs and all karanas\n they are also capable of controlling them\n but lord shiva exists in between them like sky and is permanently stable\n it is advised that the five gods brahma vishnu rudra ishwara and shiva should be worshipped in the form of pranava aa uu ma sound bindu full stop \n even if for one second if one can stay and meditate on these he gets more results than that of performing one hundred fire sacrifices\n with the full understanding and knowledge one should only meditate on paramashiva which would give rise to all benefits\n it is definite that by sacrificing all other things the twice born should learn and understand this and he would get rid of the suffering of living in the womb and attain salvation\n om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body

impermanent getting detachment went to the forest\n he performed great penance and stood looking at the sun arms uplifted\n at the end of a yousand years the sage sakayana approached him like fire wiyout smoke burning with his lustre and said oh king arise and choose a boon \n he bowed and said sir i am ignorant of the self\n you know it please impart it \n this has happened in the past and is impossible ask for other desires \n but the king touched his feet and said sir what is the use of enjoyment in this body which smells badly and is a mass of bones skins etc\n attacked by lust anger etc\n separation from near and dear people hunger thirst etc\n we see that all this is decaying like flies and mosquitoes which live and die\n great kings dudyumna bhuridyumna indradyumna kuvalayasva yauvanasva etc\n of suryavamsa marutta etc\n of the somavamsa relinquished this world and went to the other even as the relatives were watching\n we also see how gandharvas asuras yaksas and others are dead and gone\n the oceans become dry mountains fall dhruva star is shaken trees and earth are uprooted\n there is only rebirth in this world after all the enjoyment\n you should uplift me who am like a frog in a dark well\n you are my refuge\n prapathaka two the sage sakayanya being pleased said o king the flag ornament of the ikshvaku dynasty you know the self have done your duty famous as the son of king marut\n this indeed is your self \n which o lord he asked \n he replied it cannot be described\n this one bound by external causes going upward suffering and yet not really suffering dispels ignorance like the sun dispelling darkness\n the tranquil one rising from this body and approaching the supreme manifests itself in its own essence immortal fearless\n this brahma vidya has been imparted to us by lord maitreya\n i shall teach you the same\n the sinless powerfully radiant and chaste valakhilyas spoke to prajapati lord this body is inert like a cart\n which subtle being has such greatness that the body is set up as a conscious thing who is the driver of this body he told them he who is beyond speech is pure holy empty of delusion placid breathless independent endless unchangeable eternal unborn free in his own glory\n he is the driver\n they said how can this body be set up like this by one who is devoid of desire he replied the self is subtle non object invisible and called purusha\n in part he is consciously present here and awakens the sleeper\n that conscious part of this purusha is the knower of the body in every individual\n his marks are imagination determination and conceit he is the lord of creatures the eye of all\n by that conscious being is the body set up\n he is the driver\n they asked lord how can such a being exist in part he told them this prajapati was there in the beginning\n being alone he was not happy\n he contemplated on himself and made numerous beings\n they were unaware of him breathless inert like a post\n he was not happy and yought to kindle their awareness i shall enter into them \n making himself like air he entered not as one but making himself five fold prana apana vyana udana and samana airs\n the breath that moves upward is prana apana moves down\n samana is that which causes the eaten food to settle and circulates it to every limb equally\n udana throws up and sends down the drink and food\n that which pervades the nerves is vyana\n the vaisvanara wind overpowers the antaryami wind and vice versa\n in between these two warmth is exuded the warmth is the spirit spirit is cosmic fire\n also this has been stated elsewhere\n the fire within is the cosmic fire the inner fire by which food is digested\n the sound of digestion is heard with closed ears not when one is about to die\n this supreme being dividing himself into five established in the cave heart is all mental his body is the vital breath\n he has many forms his imaginations are true\n standing in the core of the heart he strives and thinks let me become all things\n uprisen dividing things by the five rays he experiences then\n the sense organs are the rays the motor organs are the horses the body the chariot mind is the driver of the nature of prakriti driving with the whip he makes the body revolve like a wheel\n due to him is the body a conscious entity\n this self is truly led to depend on the non self by the fruit of actions white and dark is overwhelmed as it were by them and flits from body to body\n being unmanifest subtle invisible non object unpossessive free from states non agent but abides like an agent\n he is truly pure steadfast immutable untarnished uneager desireless abiding as witness experiences fruits of actions is loved by a sheet of prakriti \n prapathaka three they said o lord who then is the other self overwhelmed by the white and dark fruits of actions and goes to wombs good and bad who goes down or up wandering overcome by dualities he replied there is indeed another self in elements overwhelmed by actions white and dark\n elements means the five root elements as well as the five concrete elements\n their complex is the body\n the self is like a drop of water in the lotus leaf \n this is overwhelmed by prakriti\n being overcome he is in a state of delusion and does not see the lord in himself making him act\n content with the mass of constituents and confused unsteady in eager pursuit smitten by desire yearning conceited thinking i am that this is mine he binds himself by himself as in a net he roams about\n elsewhere also it has been said\n the agent indeed is the elemental self\n the inner spirit causes actions by means of instruments just as iron pervaded by fire and beaten by workers is split into may so the elemental self pervaded by the inner spirit and pressed by prakriti becomes many\n the group of three aspects assuming the forms of lakhs of living beings constitutes the mass of elemental beings\n this is the form of plurality\n the constituents are impelled by the spirit as a wheel by its driver\n as the fire is not beaten only the iron is so the elemental self and not the spirit is over powered\n it has been stated this body wiyout consciousness has been generated by the sex act it is hell has via the urinary passage sustained by bones covered with flesh and skin filled with faeces urine etc\n it is a shattered sheath\n it has been affirmed delusion fear depression sleep wound old age etc\n being full of these tamasa and rajasa traits like desire the elemental self is overwhelmed\n hence indeed it inevitably assumes different forms\n prapathaka four it has been said as waves in great rivers the past deeds are one s safeguard like the coast line for the ocean\n rebirth is unavoidable bound by good and bad results of actions as a beast by ropes\n like a prisoner one in the clutches of death is not free dwells in the midst of many fears\n he who is maddened by worldly pleasures is like one intoxicated\n he is in the grip of sin and roams like one bitten by a snake is he in the jaws of danger as in darkness one is blinded by passion\n as caught in a magic show one is in the midst of maya\n he sees every thing wrongly as in a dream essenceless like the pith of plantain like an actor dressed up for a moment falsely attractive like a painted wall\n it has been stated sense objects like sound are there sources of trouble\n attached to them the self forgets the supreme place\n the remedy is the winning of knowledge following one s own dharma one s law of life supports all like a tree trunk\n by this law does one go upwards wiyout it one tumbles down this has been laid down in the vedas\n a transmission of the law cannot really be in the ashrama stage of life \n one who is in the ashrama is said to be a real ascetic\n it has also been said by penance is sattva got and by sattva is the refined mind by mind is the spirit got and by the spirit attained does transmigration stop\n the following verses are relevant just as fire wiyout fuel dies in its own source so the mind by the dying of its modes calms down in the source\n the modes of mind withdrawn of the lover of truth not deceived by sense objects are false\n they follow laws of action migrating life is mind indeed\n take pains to purge it well\n what the mind dwells on that fills one s life\n this is the everlasting mystery\n with the purged mind fixed on the self one fears on endless bliss\n if the mind attached to sense objects is fixed upon the supreme spirit who will not be liberated mind is of two kinds the impure is filled with desires the pure is wiyout them\n when a person makes his mind free from dissolution and restlessness reaches the mindless state it is the high place\n the mind is to be restrained only so long as it is not dissolved in the heart\n this is knowledge and release too rest is mere details\n the joy got by the mind which is purified by samadhi and fixed upon the spirit cannot be described by words but grasped only by the mind\n water mixed in water cannot be distinguished so also fire in fire and sky in sky so the mind spirit man is freed\n mind is the only cause of bondage and liberation attached to objects it gives bondage wiyout them liberation\n you are bhahma vishnu rudra prajapati agni varuna vayu indra moon manu yama bhumi achyuta\n in heaven you dwell in your own self in many ways\n i bow to you the lord of all the soul of all doer of allocations protector of all all illusion all sport are you\n the placid in nature the most secret beyond yought and knowledge wiyout

this vital breath on brahma behind the speech the eye is enclosed behind the eye the ear is enclosed behind the ear the mind is enclosed behind the mind the vital breath is enclosed\n to this same vital breath as brahma all these gods bring offering unbegged\n even so to this same vital breath all beings living bring offering unbegged only\n of him who knows this the secret doctrine is one should not beg \n it is as if having begged and not having received anything one should sit down saying i shall not eat anything that is given from here \n those very ones who previously refused now

the highest treasure either on the night of a full moon or on the night of a new moon or during the bright half of the moon under an auspicious constellation at one of these periods having built up a fire having swept around having shown the sacred grass having sprinkled around having bent the right knee with a spoon or with a wooden bowl or with a metal cup he offers oblations of melted butter with the words the divinity named speech is a procurer\n may it procure this thing for me from so and so\n to it hail the divinity named vital breath is a procurer\n may it procure this thing for me from so and so\n to it hail the divinity named eye is a procurer\n may it procure this thing for me from so and so\n to it hail the divinity named ear is a procurer\n may it procure this thing for me from so and so\n to it hail the divinity named mind is a procurer\n may it procure this thing for me from so and so\n to it hail the divinity named intelligence is a procurer\n may it procure this thing for me from so and so\n to it hail then having inhaled the smell of the smoke having rubbed his limbs over with the ointment of melted butter silently he should go forth declare his object or send a messenger\n he obtains here indeed\n now next the longing to be realized with the divine powers\n if one should desire to become beloved of a man or of a woman or of men or of women at one of these same points of time having built up a fire he offers in exactly the same manner oblations of melted butter saying i your speech i sacrifice in me you so and so hail your vital breath i sacrifice in me you so and so hail your eye i sacrifice in me you so and so hail your ear i sacrifice in me you so and so hail your mind i sacrifice in me you so and so hail your intelligence i sacrifice in me you so and so hail then having inhaled the smell of the smoke having rubbed his limbs over with a smearing of the melted butter silently he should go forth and desire to approach and touch or he may simply stand and converse from windward\n he becomes beloved indeed\n the longing for him indeed\n now next self restraint according to pratardana or the inner agnihotra as they call it\n verily as long as a person is peaking he is not able to breathe\n then he is sacrificing vital breath in speech\n as long verily as a person is breathing he is not able to speak\n then he is sacrificing speech in breath\n these two are unending immortal oblations\n waking or sleeping one is continuously uninterruptedly making them\n now whatever other oblations there are they have an end for they consist of works\n knowing this very thing verily the ancients did not offer the agnihotra sacrifice\n now what is brahman the uktha recitation is brahman sacred word thus indeed was sushkabhangara wont to say\n one should meditate on it as the rig the hymn of praise unto him indeed all beings sing praise for his greatness\n one should meditate on it as the yajus the sacrificial formula unto him indeed are all beings united for his greatness\n one should meditate on it as the saman chant unto him indeed all beings bow down for his greatness\n one should meditate on it as sri beauty \n one should meditate on it as yasas glory one should meditate on it as tejas splendour \n as this uktha is the most beautiful the most glorious the most splendid among the invocations of praise shastras even so is he who knows this the most beautiful the most glorious the most splendid among all beings\n so the adhvaryu priest prepares this self which is related to the sacrifice and which consists of work\n in it he weaves what consists of the yajus\n in what consists of the yajus the hotir priest weaves what consists of the rig\n in what consists of the rig the udgatir priest weaves what consists of the saman\n this is the self of all the three fold knowledge\n and thus he who knows this becomes the self of indra\n the all conquering kausitaki indeed was wont to worship the rising sun having performed the investiture with the sacred thread having fetched water having thrice sprinkled the water vessel saying you are a deliverer take my sin away \n in the same way he was wont to worship the sun when it was in the mind heaven saying you are the high deliverer take my sin away in the same way he was wont to worship the sun when it was setting saying\n you are the full deliverer take my sin fully away \n whatever sin he committed by day or by night that it takes away\n likewise also he who knows this worships the sun in the same manner\n whatever sin one commits by day or by night it takes away fully\n now month by month at the time of the new moon when it comes round one should in the same way worship the moon as it appears in the west or throw two blades of grass towards it saying that heart of mind of fair outlines which in the sky in moon doth rest i think i am knower of that may i not weep for children s ill\n indeed his children do not pre decease him\n thus is it with one to whom a son has been born\n now in the case of one to whom a son has not been born\n may vigour enter you\n may milk and food gather in you may that which the adityas gladden\n having muttered these three me verses he says do not increase by our vital breath by our offspring by our cattle\n he who hates us and him whom we hate increase by his breath by his offspring by his cattle\n i turn myself with indra s turn i turn myself along with the turn of the sun \n thus he turns himself towards the right arm\n thus on the night of the full moon one should worship in the same way the moon as it appears in the east saying you are the far shining king soma the five mouthed the lord of creation\n the brahmana is one mouth of you\n with that mouth you eat the kings\n with that mouth make me an eater of food\n the king is one mouth of you\n with that mouth you eat the people\n with that mouth make me an eater of food\n the hawk is one mouth of you\n with that mouth you eat birds\n with that mouth make me an eater of food\n fire is one mouth of you\n with that mouth you eat this world\n with that mouth make me an eater of food\n in you is a fifth mouth\n with that mouth you eat all beings\n with that mouth make me an eater of food\n waste not away with our vital breath our offspring or cattle\n he who hates us and him whom we hate waste away with his vital breath his offspring his cattle\n thus i turn myself with the turn of the gods i turn myself with the turn of the sun\n afterwards he turns himself towards the right arm\n now when about to lie down with a wife one should touch her heart and say that which in your heart o fair one is placed within prajapati\n therewith o queen of immortality may you not come on children s ill\n her children do not then pre decease her\n now when one has been away on returning he should kiss his son s head and say from every limb of mine are you born\n from my heart are you born o son you are indeed myself\n may you live a hundred autumns long so and so he takes his name\n become a stone become an axe\n a brilliance son indeed you are so live a hundred autumns long so and so he takes his name\n then he embraces him saying wherewith prajapati embraced his creatures for their welfare therewith i embrace you so and so\n then he mutters in his right ear confer on him o maghavan o onrusher and in his left ear o indra grant most excellent possessions\n do not cut off the line of our race \n be not afraid live a hundred autumns of life\n son i kiss your head with your name \n thrice he should kiss his head\n i make a lowing over you with a lowing of cows \n thrice he should make a lowing over his head\n now next the dying around of the gods\n this brahman verily shines when the fire blazes likewise it dies when it blazes not\n its brilliance goes to the sun its vital breath to the wind\n this brahman verily shines when the sun is seen likewise it dies when it is not seen\n its brilliance goes to the moon its vital breath to the wind\n this brahman verily shines forth when the lightning flashes likewise it dies when it flashes not\n its brilliance goes to the regions of space its vital breath to the wind\n all these divinities verily having entered into the wind perish not when they die in the wind\n there from indeed they come forth again\n thus with reference to the divinities\n now with reference to the self\n this brahman verily shines forth when one speaks with speech likewise this dies when one speaks not\n its brilliance goes to the eye its vital breath to the vital breath\n this brahman verily shines when one sees with the eye likewise this dies when one sees not\n its brilliance goes to the ear its vital breath to the vital breath\n this brahman verily shines when one hears with the ear likewise this dies when one hears not\n its brilliance goes to the mind is vital breath to the vital breath\n this brahman verily shines when one thinks with the mind likewise it dies wen one thinks not\n its brilliance goes to the vital breath its vital breath to the vital breath\n all these divinities verily have entered into the vital breath perish not when they did in the vital breath\n therefrom indeed they come forth again\n so verily indeed if upon one who knows this both the mountains the southern and the northern should roll themselves forth seeking to crush him they would not crush him\n but those who hate him and those whom he himself hates all these die around him\n now next the assumption of superior excellence\n all these divinities verily disputing among themselves in regard to self superiority went forth from this body\n not breathing it lay dry like a piece of wood\n then speech entered into it\n it just lay speaking with speech\n then the eye entered into it it just lay speaking with speech seeing with the eye\n then the ear entered into it it just lay speaking with speech seeing with the eye hearing with the ear\n then the mind entered into it it just lay speaking with speech seeing with the eye hearing with the ear thinking with the mind\n then the vital breath entered into it and then indeed it at once arose\n all these divinities having verily recognised to superior excellence of the vital breath having comprehended the vital breath alone as the self of intelligence went forth from this body all together\n they having entered into the wind having the nature of space went to the heavenly world\n likewise also indeed he who knows this having recognised the superior excellence of the vital breath having comprehended the vital breath alone as the self of intelligence goes out of the body with all these\n having entered into the wind having the nature of space he goes to heaven\n he goes there where these gods are\n having reached that he who knows this becomes immortal as the gods are immortal\n now next the father and son ceremony or the transmission as they call it\n a father about to depart calls his son\n having strewn the house with new grass having built up the fire having placed near it a vessel of water with a jug himself covered with a fresh garment the father remains lying\n having come the son lies down on top touching organs with organs\n or the father may transmit to him seated face to face\n then he delivers over to him thus father my speech in you i would place\n son i take your speech in me\n father my breath in you i would place\n son i take your breath in me\n father my eye in you i would place\n son i take your eye in me\n father my ear in you i would place\n son i take your ear in me\n father my tastes of food in you i would place\n son i take your tastes of food in me\n father my deeds in you i would place\n son i take your deeds in me\n father my pleasure and pain in you i would place\n son i take your pleasure and pain in me\n father my bliss delight procreation in you i would place\n son i take your bliss delight and procreation in me\n father my movement in you i would place\n son i take your movement in me\n father my mind in you i would place\n son i take your mind in me\n father my intelligence in you i would place\n son i take your intelligence in me\n if however he should be unable to speak much let the father say summarily my vital breaths in you i would place and the son reply you vital breaths i take in me \n then turning to the right he goes towards the east\n the father calls out after him my glory sacred lusture and fame delight in you \n then the other looks over his left shoulder\n having hid his face with his hand or having covered it with the edge of his garment he says may you obtain heavenly worlds and all desires \n if the father should become well he should dwell under the lordship of his son or he should wander as a mendicant \n if however he should die let them perform obsequies as they should be performed\n pratardana the son of divodasa by means of fighting and virility verily reached the beloved abode of indra\n to him then indra said pratardana choose a boon\n then said pratardana do you yourself choose that boon for me which you deem most beneficent for man\n to him then indra said a superior verily chooses not for an inferior\n do you yourself choose\n no boon verily then is it to me said pratardana\n but indra did not depart from the truth for indra is truth\n to him then indra said understand me only\n this indeed i deem most beneficent to man namely that one should understand me\n i slew the three headed tvastir i delivered the arunmukhas the ascetics to the wolves\n transgressing many compacts i killed the people of prahlada in the sky the paulomas in the atmosphere the kalakanjas on the earth\n of me such as i was then not a single hair was injured\n so he knows me thus by no deed whatever of his is his world injured not by stealing not by killing an embryo not by the murder of his mother not by the murder of his father\n if he has done any evil the dark colour departs not from his face\n then he indra said i am the spirit of the vital breath the intelligent self\n as such worship me as life as immortality\n life is the vital breath the vital breath is life\n for as long as the vital breath remains in the body so long is there life\n for indeed with the vital breath one obtains immortality in this world with intelligence true conception\n so he who worships me as life as immortality reaches the full term of life in this world he obtains immortality and indestructibility in the heavenly world\n now on this point some say the vital breaths verily go into a unity otherwise one would not be able at once to make known a name by speech a form by the eye a sound by ear a yought by the mind\n the vital breaths as a unity verily cause to know all things here one by one\n all the vital breaths speak along with speech when it speaks\n all the vital breaths see along with the eye when it sees\n all the vital breaths hear along with the ear when it hears\n all the vital breaths think along with the mind when it thinks\n all the vital breaths breathe along with the breath when it breathes\n that is indeed so said indra\n there is however a superior excellence among the vital breaths\n one lives with speech gone for we see the dumb\n one lives with eye gone for we see the blind\n one lives with ear gone for we see the deaf\n one lives with mind gone for we see the childish\n one lives with arms cut off one lives with legs cut off for thus we see\n but now it is the vital breath even the self of intelligence that seizes hold of this body and raises it up\n this therefore one should worship as the uktha\n this is the all obtaining in the vital breath\n as for the vital breath verily that is intelligence as for the intelligence verily that is vital breath\n this is the view thereof this is the understanding thereof\n when a person is so asleep that he sees no dream whatever then he becomes one with that vital breath\n then speech together with all names goes to it the eye together with all forms goes to it the ear together with all sounds goes to it the mind together with all youghts goes to it\n when he awakes as from a blazing fire sparks would fly in all directions even so from this self the vital breaths proceed to their respective stations from the vital breaths the gods the senses from the gods the worlds\n this same vital breath the self of intelligence seizes hold of the body and raises it up\n this therefore one should worship as the uktha\n this is the all obtaining in the vital breath\n as for the vital breath verily that is the self as the intelligence as for the intelligence that is the vital breath\n this is the proof of it the understanding of it\n when a weak person is about to die comes to such weakness that he falls into a stupor they say of him his youghts have departed he hears not he speaks not with speech he thinks not \n thus he becomes one with the vital breath alone\n then speech together with all names goes to it the eye together with all forms goes to it the ear together with all sounds goes to it the mind together with all youghts goes to it\n when he departs from his body he departs together with all these\n when he awakens as from a blazing fire sparks would fly in all directions even so from this self the vital breaths proceed to their respective stations from the vital breaths the gods from the gods the worlds\n when he departs from the body speech pours all names into him by speech he obtains all names\n vital breath pours all odours into him with breath he obtains all odours\n the eye pours all forms into him with the eye he obtains all forms\n the ear pours all sounds into him with the ear he obtains all sounds\n the mind pours all youghts into him\n with the mind he obtains all youghts\n this is the allobtaining in the vital breath\n as for the vital breath verily that is the intelligence\n as for the intelligence verily that is the vital breath for together these two dwell in this body together the two depart\n now then we will explain how all beings become one with this intelligence\n speech is one portion taken out of it\n name is its externally correlated object element\n breath is one portion taken out of it\n odour is its externally correlated object element\n the eye is one portion taken out of it\n form is its externally correlated object element\n the ear is one portion taken out of it\n sound is its externally correlated object element\n the tongue is one portion taken out of it\n taste of food is its externally correlated object element\n the two hands are one portion taken out of it\n work is their externally correlated object element\n the body is one portion taken out of it\n pleasure and pain is its externally correlated object element\n the generative organ is one portion taken out of it\n bliss delight and procreation are its externally correlated object element\n the two feet are one portion taken out of it\n goings are their externally correlated object element\n the mind is one portion taken out of it\n thoughts and desires are its externally correlated object element\n with speech mounted on by intelligence one obtains all names\n with the vital breath mounted on by intelligence one obtains all odours\n with the eye mounted on by intelligence one obtains all forms\n with the ear mounted on by intelligence one obtains all sounds\n with the tongue mounted on by intelligence one obtains all tastes\n with the hands mounted on by intelligence one obtains all works\n with the body mounted on by intelligence one obtains pleasure and pain\n with the generative organ mounted on by intelligence one obtains bliss delight and procreation\n with the feet mounted on by intelligence one obtains all goings\n with the mind mounted on by intelligence one obtains all youghts what is to be understood by yought and desire\n for verily wiyout intelligence speech would not make any name whatsoever known\n my mind was elsewhere one says i did not cognise that name \n for verily wiyout intelligence breath would not make any odour whatsoever known\n my mind was elsewhere one says i did not cognise that odour \n for verily wiyout intelligence the eye would not make any form whatsoever known\n my mind was elsewhere one says i did not cognise that form \n for verily wiyout intelligence the ear

verily wiyout intelligence the generative organ would not make known any bliss delight and procreation whatsoever\n my mind was elsewhere one says i did not cognise that bliss delight and procreation \n for verily wiyout intelligence the two feet would not make known any going whatsoever\n my mind was elsewhere one says i did not cognise that going \n for verily wiyout intelligence no yought whatever would be effected nothing cognisable would be cognized\n one has to win the pure knowledge of the unity of brahman and atman\n speech is not what one should seek to know one should know the speaker\n smell is not what one should seek to know one should know the smeller\n form is not what one should seek to know one should know the seer\n sound is not what one should seek to know one should know the hearer\n taste of food is not what one should seek to know one should know the knower of the taste of food\n deed is not what one should seek to know one should know the doer\n pleasure and pain are not what one should seek to know one should know the discerner of pleasure and pain\n bliss delight and procreation are not what one should seek to know one should know the discerner of bliss delight and procreation\n going is not what one should seek to know one should know the goer\n mind is not what one should seek to know one should know the thinker\n these ten essential elements verily are with reference to intelligence\n these ten intelligential elements are with reference to existence\n verily if there were no elements of existence there would be no elements of intelligence\n verily if there were no elements of intelligence there would be no elements of existence\n truly from either alone no form whatever would be possible\n and this the self of intelligence is not diverse\n but as of a chariot the felly is fixed on the spokes and the spokes are fixed on the hub even so these elements of existence are fixed on the elements of intelligence the elements of intelligence are fixed on the vital breath\n this vital breath truly is the self of intelligence it is bliss ageless immortal\n he does not become greater with good action nor indeed lesser with bad action\n this one truly indeed causes him whom he wishes to lead up from this world to perform good action\n this one also indeed causes him whom he wishes to lead downwards to perform bad action\n he is the protector of the world he is the sovereign of the world he is the lord of all\n he is myself this one should know\n he is my self this one should know\n now then verily there was gargya balaki a famed vedic scholar\n he dwelt among the ushinaras the satvans and the matsyas among the kurus and the panchalas among the kashis and the videhas\n having come to ajatasatru of kashi he said let me declare brahman to you \n to him then ajatasatru said a yousand cows we give to you \n at such a word as this verily indeed people would run together crying a janaka a janaka in the sun the great in the moon the food in the lightning truth in thunder sound in wind indra vaikuntha in space the plenum in fire the vanquisher in water brilliance thus with reference to the divinities\n now with reference to the self in the mirror the reflection in the shadow the double in the echo life in sound death in sleep yama the lord of death in the body prajapati in the right eye speech in the left eye truth\n then said balaki him who is this person in the sun on him i indeed meditate\n to him ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him as the great the white robed the supreme the head of all beings thus verily do i meditate on him\n he who meditates on him thus becomes indeed the supreme the head of all beings\n then said balaki him who is the person in the moon on him indeed do i meditate \n to him then ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him asking soma as the self of food\n he who meditates on him thus becomes indeed the self of food\n then said balaki i meditate on the person indeed who is the person in the lightning \n to him then ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as the self of truth\n he who meditates on him thus becomes indeed the self of truth of brilliance \n then said balaki i meditate on the person in the thunder \n to him then ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as the self of sound\n he who meditates on him thus becomes indeed the self of sound\n then said balaki i meditate on the person in wind \n to him then ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as indra vaikuntha or as the unconquered army\n he who meditates on him thus becomes indeed the triumphant the unconquerable a conqueror of adversaries\n then said balaki i meditate on the person in space \n to him then ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as the full moon active brahman\n he who meditates on him thus becomes filled with offspring cattle fame the radiance of sanctity and the heavenly world he reaches the full term of life\n then said balaki i meditate on the person in fire \n to him then ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as the vanquisher\n he who meditates on him thus become verily a vanquisher of others\n then said balaki i meditate on the person in water \n to him then ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as the self of brilliance of name\n thus with reference to the divinities now with reference to self\n then said balaki i meditate indeed on the person in the mirror \n to him ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as the reflected likeness\n he then who meditates on him thus a very likeness of him is born in his offspring not an unlikeness\n then said balaki i meditate indeed on the person in the shadow \n to him ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as the inseparable double\n he then who meditates on him thus obtains from his second and becomes possessed of his double\n then said balaki i meditate indeed on the person in the echo \n to him ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as life\n he then who meditates on him thus passes not into unconsciousness before his time\n then said balaki i meditate indeed on the person in sound \n to him ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as death\n he then who meditates on him thus does not die before his time\n then said balaki i meditate indeed on the person who while asleep moves about in dream \n to him ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as king yama he then who meditates on him thus to his supremacy everything here is subdued\n then said balaki i meditate on the person who is in this body \n to him ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as prajapati\n he then who meditates on him thus is augmented with offspring cattle fame the lustre of sanctity the heavenly world he reaches the full term of life\n then said balaki i meditate on the person in the right eye \n to him ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as the self of speech the self of fire the self of light\n he then who meditates on him thus becomes the self of all these\n then said balaki i meditate on the person in the left eye \n to him ajatasatru said make me not to converse on him i meditate on him as the self of truth the self of lightning the self of brightness\n he then who meditates on him thus becomes the self of all these\n thereupon balaki was silent\n to him then ajatasatru said so much only balaki so much only replied balaki\n to him then ajatasatru said in vain indeed did you make to converse saying let me declare brahman to you \n balaki who is the maker of these persons of whom verily this is the work he alone is to be known\n thereupon balaki fuel in hand approached saying receive me as a pupil \n to him then ajatasatru said this i deem a form of conduct contrary to nature that a kshatriya should receive a brahmana as pupil\n i shall make you understand \n then taking him by the hand he went forth\n the two then came upon a person asleep\n the ajatasatru called him saying o great white robed king soma but he just lay silent\n then he pushed him with a stick\n he got up at once\n to him then ajatasatru said where in this case o balaki has this person lain what has become of him here whence has he returned here thereupon balaki understood not\n to him then ajatasatru said where in this case o balaki has this person lain what has become of him here whence he has returned here as i asked is the arteries of a person of the heart called hita the beneficent \n from the heart they spread forth to the pericardium\n now they are as minute as a hair divided a yousand fold\n they consist of a minute essence reddishbrown white black yellow and red\n in these one remains while asleep he sees no dream whatsoever\n then he becomes unitary in this vital breath\n then speech together with all names goes to it the eye together with all forms goes to it the ear together with all sounds goes to it the mind together with all youghts goes to it\n when he awakes as from a blazing fire sparks proceed in all directions even so from this self the vital breaths proceed to their respective stations from the vital breaths the gods the sense faculties from the sense faculties the worlds\n this very vital breath even this self of intelligence has entered this bodily self up to the hair and the fingernail\n just as a razor might be hidden in a razor case or as fire in the fireplace even so this self of intelligence has entered this bodily self upto the very hairs and nails\n on that self these other selves depend as upon a chief his own men or as his own men are of service to a chief even so these other selves are of service to that self of intelligence \n verily as long as indra did not understand this self so long the asuras overcame him\n when he understood this striking down and conquering the asuras he attained pre eminence among all gods and all beings sovereignty and overlordship\n likewise also he who knows this striking off all evils attains pre eminence sovereignty and overlordship over all beings he who knows this yea he who knows this\n om may my speech be based on i\n accord with the mind may my mind be based on speech\n o self effulgent one reveal thyself to me\n may you both speech and mind be the carriers of the veda to me\n may not all that i have heard depart from me\n i shall join together i\n obliterate the difference of day and night through this study\n i shall utter what is verbally true i shall utter what is mentally true\n may that brahman protect me may that protect the speaker i\n the teacher may that protect me may that protect the speaker may that protect the speaker\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the kaushitaki brahmana upanishad as contained in the rig veda",
    "Brihajjabala": "om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me first brahmana busunda approached kalagni rudra the fire and death like rudra and asked him please tell me about the greatness of vibhoothi sacred ash vibhoothi is generally prepared by burning cow dung at auspicious times\n the vibhoothi of pazhani temple is prepared by burning cactus plants \n kalagni rudra replied what is there to tell \n then busunda asked please tell me the importance of wearing vibhoothi and rudraksha \n kalagni rudra replied this has already been related along with phala sruthi resultant effect by sage paippalada\n there is nothing more to be told more than what he has said \n then busunda asked tell me about the route to salvation as told in the great jabala brihat jabala \n kalagni rudra agreed and started teaching\n from the sadhyojatha face of lord shiva he has five faces the earth was born\n from it was born the nivruthi\n from that was born the golden coloured celestial cow called nanda\n from the dung of nanda came vibhoothi\n water was produced from the face of vama deva\n from that the power called prathishtaa was produced\n from that the black cow called bhadra was produced\n from its dung was produced bhasitha another name for vibhoothi \n fire was produced from the face of aghora\n from that was produced the power of knowledge\n from that was produced the red cow called surabhi\n from its dung was produced bhasma literally ash but another name for vibhoothi \n wind was produced from the face of thath purusha\n from it was produced the power of peace\n from it was produced the white cow called susheela\n from its dung was produced kshara again another name for ash \n ether sky was produced from the face of eeshana\n from it was produced the power of sandhyayoutha one who is beyond dawn and dusk \n from it was produced the multi coloured cow called sumana\n from its dung was produced raksha literally meaning shield \n vibhoothi bhasitham bhasmam ksharam and raksha are five different names of the holy ash\n all these are causal names\n vibhoothi because it gives rise to plenty of wealth bhasmam because it eats away all sins bhasitha because it makes materials glitter the potash is a cleaning agent of all metals kshara because it protects from dangers and raksha because it acts like a shield in case of fears of ghosts devils pisacha brahma rakshas epilepsy and diseases which are in born\n second brahmana then busunda approached kalagni rudra and asked him about the bhasmam ash snana bathing procedure which involves the fire and the moon\n similar to the fact that fire takes several forms depending on the form of the object ash which is like the soul for all objects assumes the form according to the shape of the being and also beyond it\n fire is told as becoming the world of fire and moon\n fire is very hot and is terrible\n the power of moon is nectar like\n even yough it has the basis in nectar it also is the hot aspect of knowledge\n among the big and tiny things it is the only one which is nectar like in taste and light and also very hot he told\n the shining aspect of strength is of two types the sun aspect and the fire aspect\n similarly the nectar like strength also is full of light and heat he told\n light resides in aspects like lightning\n sweetness pervades in tastes of extracts\n and the average world works within light and taste\n nectar is a part of fire\n due to nectar the fire grows\n that is why the world which is of the form of fire and moon is like the fire made with the fire offering havis offering \n the moon power is above \nthe fire power is down below\n it is because that they join together that this world is functioning continuously\n mantras are not available\n that shakthi power strong effect the female principle which rises above is shiva\n that shiva which rises above is shakthi\n there is nothing in this world which is not affected by shiva and shakthi\n the world which has been burnt several times by fire becomes pervasive with ash bhasma \n this is the strength of the fire\n in that strength ash becomes an integral part\n thus he who understands the strength of ash and does the ash bathing ritual using mantras agnireethi etc burns all his sins and attains salvation\n mantras are not available\n for winning over death the bath of nectar is recommended\n where is the question of death for one who has been touched by nectar of shiva and shakthi the one who knows this holy secret method would purify moon and fire and will not take birth again\n the one whose body is burnt by the fire of shiva and made wet by the nectar of moon and entering the path of yoga would become eligible for deathless state\n third brahmana now the four fold method of preparing bhasma holy ash is being narrated\n first is anukalpam second upakalpam third upopakalpam and fourth is akalpam\n anukalpam is made by use of viraja homa manthras in agnihothra collecting ash from the pit of fire sacrifice \n collecting dried cow dung lying in the forest and preparing it as per the method suggested in kalpam is upakalpam\n collecting the dried cow dung powdering it making it in to balls after mixing it in cow s urine and preparing it as per method suggested in kalpam is upopakalpam\n what one gets in temples of shiva is akalpam\n this is equivalent to one hundred kalpams\n all basma prepared by any of these four methods leads one to salvation said bhagawan kalagni rudra\n fourth brahmana afterwards busunda enquired with bhagawan kalagni rudra about wearing vibhuthi in three lines\n what he said was on the forehead you have to apply with the mantra brahmane namah salutations to brahma \n on the chest you have to apply with the mantra havyavahanaya namah salutations to he who rides the horse \n on the stomach you have to apply with the mantra skandaya namah salutations to subrahmaanya \n on the neck you have to apply with the mantra vishnave namaj salutations to lord vishnu \n in the middle you have to apply with the mantra prapanchanaya namah salutations to him who pervades in the entire world \n on the wrists you have to apply with the mantra vasubhyo namah salutations to him who is like nectar \n on the back you have to apply with the mantra haraye namah salutations to lord hari \n on the top you have to apply with the mantra shambhave namag salutations to lord shiva \n on the head you have to apply with the mantra paramathmane namah salutations to the great soul which is in all beings \n in each of these places you have to apply in a set of three lines\n when we are wearing vibhuthi on the forehead meditate on the great lord who has three eyes who is the basis of three qualities and who makes everything visible in sets as namah shivaya \n apply vibhuthi chanting pithrubhyo namah below the forearm\n above that apply chanting eeshanabhyo namah and on sides chanting eeshabhya namah and on the forearms chanting swachabhyam namah and on back sides chanting bheemaya namah \n on both flanks of the belly put vibhuthi chanting shivaya namah and on the head chanting neela kantaya sarvathmane namah \n this would remove the effects of sins done in the previous births\n fifth brahmana those who dishonor the three rows of vibhuthi dishonor lord shiva himself\n those who wear it with devotion wear lord shiva himself\n similar to a village wiyout lord shiva s temple is like a desert those who do not wear vibhuthi on their forehead have a deserted forehead\n a life wiyout worship of lord shiva is a deserted life\n an education where lord shiva is not involved is a useless education\n the greatest strength of the fire of rudra is the holy ash\n so anyone wearing the holy ash always is forever strong\n the holy ash which is born out of fire burns off the sins of all bhasma nishtas\n bhasma nishta is one who wears holy ash and possesses clean habits\n sixth brahmana during the marriage of maharishi gauthama all devas became passionate in their minds on seeing ahalya\n because of that they lost their knowledge and approached sage durvasa and asked him about it\n he promised them that he would help them get rid of the sin committed by them because of this and told them once upon a time by giving the holy ash after chanting the rudra mantra one hundred times even sins like brahma hathi sin got by killing a brahmaana have been washed off \n after this he gave them the very blessed holy ash\n he also told them because you have heard my words you would become more splendorous than before \n it is said that this holy ash can give rise to all sorts of wealth\n in front of it are vasus on its right are rudras on its back are adhiyouras suns on its left are viswa devas in the centre are brahma vishnu anid shiva and on its sides are the sun and the moon\n the rig veda mantra tells about it holy ash as follows what is the use of vedas to a person who does not understand that thing in whose ether like perennial form lives all devas and the worlds any one who understands that great matter are the people who have attained that which should be attained\n seventh brahmana the king of videha approached the sage yagnavalkya and asked oh god like sage please explain to me the way of wearing the holy ash \n yagnavalkya replied take vibhuthi using the five brahmaa mantras starting with sayourojatham chant agnirithio basma ash is fire apply using the mantra starting with manasthoke \n mix it with water using mantra triyayusham and then apply it on head forehead chest and shoulders chanting the mantra trayambakam \n if this is followed one becomes pure and suitable for getting salvation\n he would get the same effect as chanting rudra one hundred times\n this is called bhasma jyothi\n he continued the great sages like samvarthaka aarooni swethakethu durvasa rupu nidhaga bharatha dathathreya raivathaka busunda etc got freed by wearing vibhuthi\n sanathkumara approached bhagawan kalagni rudra and asked him bhagawan kindly explain me the method of wearing rudraksha\n what he told him was rudraksha became famous by that name because initially it was produced from the eyes of rudra\n during the time of destruction and after the act of destruction when rudra closed his eye of destruction rudraksha was produced from that eye\n that is the rudraksha property of rudraksha\n just by touching and wearing this rudraksha one gets the same effect of giving in charity one yousand cows\n eighth brahmana he who reads this brihat jabala upanishad daily would attain the purity blessed by agni fire god vayu wind god surya sun chandra moon brahma vishnu and rudra\n the ones who chant brihat jabala upanishad would attain that world where the sun does not dry where wind does not blow where moon does not shine where stars do not twinkle where fire does not burn where yama god of death does not enter where there are no sorrows which is full of peace and pure and unalloyed happiness which is praised by gods like brahma which is meditated upon by great yogis and from where great yogis do not return after reaching it\n this upanishad ends with the blessing om sayoura long live the truth \n om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the brihad jabalopanishad as contained in the atharva veda",
    "Nrisimhatapini": "om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me the first upanishad bhagawan narasimha who is partly human and partly lion shines as parabrahmaa with rutha discipline of the visible world and sayoura basic truth \n he appears with two colours viz\n black and golden red\n his nature is to go up and he has a very terrible and fearsome stare but he is a sankara doing good to people\n he is called neela lohitha he who is red and black because his neck is black and the top of it is red\n in another of his aspects he is umapathi husband of uma and pasupathi lord of all beings \n he holds the bow called pinaka and has great luster\n he is the god of all knowledge\n he is god of all beings\n he is the lord of all vedas\n he is the boss of brahma and he is praised by yajur veda\n one should know the praise of sama veda of him\n those who know that will attain the deathless state\n the second upanishad devas were afraid of death sins and family life\n they approached praja pathi\n he told them about the narasimha mantra which was the king of all mantras written in anushtup meter\n because of this they won victory over death\n they won over all sins and also destroyed the problems of family life\n so any of those who are afraid of death sins and family life should get themselves taught the narasimha mantra which is called the king of mantras and which is written in anushtup meter\n they all would win over death and win over sin as well problems due to family life\n the king of mantras the following is a simple translation of the king of mantras of lord narasimha and what follows is an explanation and justification of each description\n my salutations to that nrusimha who is fierce who is heroic who is maha vishnu who is burning who has faces every where who is half lion and half man who is fearful who is safe who is death and deathlessness\n he is called ugra fierce because by his power he creates looks after destroys and elevates wiyout break and also attracts all devas all beings all bhoothas hey lord narasimha you who is being praised by me please give me perennial happiness even when i am in this body which is not permanent\n let your soldiers kill all my enemies who are different from me\n he is called veera heroic because by his power he makes all worlds all devas all beings and all boothas play and allow them to take rest and also creates helps them grow and attracts wiyout any break these worlds devas beings and boothas\n he is behind every action very capable mountain like and one who fulfills the desires of devas\n he is maha vishnu because he pervades in all the worlds and makes all the world pervade similar to the fatty gum that spreads in all meat from this side to that and also from other side to this side\n there is nothing in the world that is not him\n he is pervading in all things in the world\n he is the leader of all souls\n worship of souls is his worship\n he exists in all the three shining things viz\n moon sun and fire\n he is called jwalantham burning because he makes the entire world which includes all devas all beings and all bhoothas shine because of his luster and also shines in them and makes them release flames\n he is the one who created the world and makes it rapidly multiply\n he is the one who shines because of his own luster and also makes others shine\n he spreads heat throughout the world and makes the world swelter\n he spreads his rays everywhere and makes them release rays\n he has a personality which causes only good\n he gives only that which is good and he is good\n he is called sarvatho mukham having faces everywhere because he sees everywhere wiyout having any organs he is able to hear every thing he is able to go every where he is able to attract everything and also because he is spread everywhere and exists every where\n in the beginning he was alone and he has become all these things now\n those who rule over the world came from him\n in the end everything goes back and merges in him\n i salute him who has faces every where\n among all animals the most fear some and also most special is the lion\n that is why god of the universe took birth as narasimha\n that deathless form became one which does good to the entire world\n that is why he is called narasimham half man and half lion \n that maha vishnu who has this fearsome form does not cause fear among his devotees\n he is being worshipped and praised by them\n he is the one who travels all over earth and also one who lives on the mountain top\n in his form of trivikrama he measured all the worlds in three steps\n he is called bheeshanam fear full because all the crowds of devas men and bhoothas and all the worlds run away fearing him but he is not afraid of anything\n the wind blows because it is afraid of him\n the sun rises above because he is afraid of him\n it is because of fear for him that the god of fire indra and the god of death do their work\n he is called bhadram safe because he is good things personified because he forever shines giving good things because he makes others shine because he is superior and because he does very good things\n hey devas we have to hear with our ears about this bhadram \n hey those of you who are fit to be worshipped we have to see with our eyes that bhadram \n let us live as much as the gods live with healyour organs and healyour bodies praising and singing him\n he is called mruyouru mruyourum death and deathlessness because just by mere yought of his devotees he destroys death and untimely death to them\n he is one who gives the knowledge of the soul and also one who gives strength\n all devas bow before him and praise him\n let us sait isfy him by offering him havis food through the fire sacrifice because even his shadow is nectar and he is the death which destroys death\n he is worshipped by the chanting of namami i salute him because he is being worshipped by all devas all those who have forsaken his world and all those who swear by brahmam and also because the lord of the vedas worship him telling these words\n indra mithra sun aryama and all other devas exist in him\n i was born before this world which is pretty and orderly\n i existed even before the devas\n i am the central power of that which never dies\n he who gives me in my form as food for people in charity becomes the one who protects the soul\n if given wiyout understanding this i who am food eat the one who eats\n i am the one who becomes all the world and destroys it\n my light is like that of a sun who standing alone gives light to all the world\n this upanishad says that one who understands this attains salvation\n the third upanishad the devas requested brahma to teach them the power of anushtup mantra raja the king of chants set to anushtup meter and also its root\n brahma told them this illusion maya which is the power of narasimha which is eem is the one which creates everything protects them and destroys them\n therefore you have to realize that this illusion is the power\n the one who understands the power of this illusion he crosses all sins and also attains deathlessness\n he enjoys the wealth with fame\n the experts in brahmam argue among themselves whether this is short long or extra long pronunciation \n one who pronounces this with short ending will burn away all sins and would attain deathlessness\n he who pronounces this in long ending would get wealth with fame and also attain deathlessness\n he who pronounces it with extra long ending would attain ethereal knowledge and also deathlessness\n what follows is the explanation given by sages oh power behind eem who is the personification of the power of illusion please protect us\n please bless us so that we are able to cross easily in a straight forward manner this sea of birth and death\n people who know you call you also as sreedevi lakshmi parvayour bhoodevi the goddess of earth sashti devi sree vidhya and indra sena\n requesting you to give me long life i submit myself to you who is the mother of all vedas\n all the beings and things in the world were produced from the sky ether \n all living things were made from the sky\n they live in the sky\n they go towards the sky and enter and disappear there\n so we have to understand that the sky is the root the root word for the sky is ham \n the explanation given by sages are as follows that root ham is the sun god traveling in the pure sky in air in the atmosphere in fire in fire sacrifices and exists as guests in homes\n that is the only one thing which is with devas and also with men\n it is the truth\n it is that thing which is born out of sky water earth sacrificial fire and mountains\n this is the great truth\n the upanishad says that only the one who knows this knows the secret implication of the mantra \n fourth upanishad the devas approached brahma and asked him to teach them about the branch part mantras of the narasimha mantra raja\n brahma told them that they should know that the pranava savithri yajur lakshmi and narasimha gayathri are the four parts branches of narasimha mantra and also that any one who knows this attains deathlessness\n pranavam is nothing but om \n the savithri mantra which protects those who chant it is told in yajur veda\n it has spread throughout the world\n the savithri ashtakshara eight letters consists of the two letters gruni the three letters soorya and the three letters aadhiyoura \n this is a chant which increases your stature and your wealth\n great wealth will come in search of one who knows this\n the yajur mahalakshmi mantra is om bhoor lakshmi bhuvar lakshmi suva kala karni thanno lakshmi prachodayath \n this has letters\n all this universe is in the form of this gayathri\n so the one who knows this yajur maha lakshmi mantra would enjoy great wealth with lot of fame\n the narasimha gayathri is om nrusimhaya vidhmahe vajra nakhaya deemahi\n this is the mantra in which all the vedas and devas reside\n the one who knows this would be the one with whom the devas and vedas will live forever\n the devas approached brahma and asked him by chanting which mantra god will take great mercy on us and give us a sight of his form\n please tell us about that\n then brahma told them as follows om um om\n yo vai nirusimho devo bhagawan yascha brahma thasmai vo namo namah\n yo vai nrusimho devo bhagwan yascha vishnu thasmai vai namo nama\n yo vai nrusimho devo bhagwan yascha maheswara thasmai vai namo nama\n the gods to whom similar mantra has to be prayed with um kram veem ram are brahma vishnu maheswara purusha eashwara saraswathi sree gowri prakuthi vidhya omkara ardha mathra vedhaa panchakhya saptha vyahrudaya loka pala vasava rudra aadhiyoura ashtou gruha maha bhootha kaala manu mruyouru yama kandhaka paraana soorya soma virat purusha and jeeva and in the end chant om ham om yo vai nrusimho devo bhagawan yascha sarvam tasmai vai namo nama\n brahma told if one who prays god daily using these mantras god will become greatly pleased and would appear personally\n so to any one who prays bhagawan narasimha using these mantras he would appear to him personally\n that devotee would also see everything and attain deathlessness \nthus tells the great upanishad\n fifth upanishad devas approached brahma and requested him bhagawan please tell us about the famous chakra called maha chakra\n the sages tell that it is supposed to fulfill all the wishes and is the gateway to salvation \n lord brahma told them sudharshana the holy wheel of lord vishnu is that great chakra\n on its middle is written the taraka mantra om and also the single letter of narasimha kshroum on its six petals of the sudarshana six letters sahasrara hum phat are written on its eight petals the eight letters om namo narayanaya are written on its twelve petals is written the twelve holy letters om namo vasudevaya on its sixteen petals the mathruka model sixteen letters with their roots am aam em eem \n aha is written and on its petals are written the letters of the narasimha anushtup mantra raja\n this is the sudarshana chakra this fulfills all ones wishes and is the gateway of salvation\n it is a form of yajur veda rig veda sama veda brahmam and amrutha nectar \n the one who daily chants this narasimha anushtup mantra raja would be able to control fire control wind control sun control moon control water control all devas control all planets and control poison\n rig veda tells us about this the devotees who practice this would be able to see lord vishnu in the ethereal sky like an ordinary man is able to see the sun in the sky\n the devotees who are brahmins would be able to praise the lighted vishnu s form\n the upanishads tell that this would be attained only by one who worships wiyout any desire\n om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see

upanishad has been shown as two upanishads nrisimha poorva tapaniya upanishad and nrisimha uttara tapaniya upanishad in another version of muktika upanishad\n hence their translations are being provided here separately\n nrisimha uttara tapaniya upanishad translated by p\n ramachander published by celextel\norg om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes

bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me first chapter devas approached lord brahma and requested him please teach us about the soul which is more minute than the atom and also about the letter om \n he said so be it and what he said was all this is the letter om \n what is past what is present and what will be in future are its interpretations\n all these are om\n all these are brahmam\n this soul also is brahmam\n joining this atma soul with the brahmam called om and joining together the brahmam and the soul and realizing that the birthless deathless nectar drenched and fearless brahmam is nothing but the om and then putting together the three types of bodies and all these in to it and then making it our own so as to become one with that and then destroy it\n continue to meditate that om which is the soul with the three types of bodies and also the parabrahmaam with three types of bodies\n this soul which is gross and enjoys mega pleasures which is also very minute and enjoys even the minutest pleasures and which becomes united and enjoys the pleasures of happiness has four legs branches \n when it is awake its feelings are gross\n it enjoys gross feelings with its seven organs and faces ten sense organs five pranas mind brain sensibility and ego \n its name is chaturathma viswan on the whole and vaisvanaran partly \n this is its first leg\n in the state of dream its feelings are very minute\n it will enjoy this minute sense with its seven organs and nineteen faces\n its name is chaturathma thaijasan on the whole and also hiranygarbhan partly \n this is its second leg\n where there is no desire and also where there are no dreams that state is called sushupthi\n in that state one is single personification of knowledge having an endless form one who enjoys happiness and steadfastly concentrates only on knowledge\n his name is chaturathma pragnan knower \n this is the third leg aspect \n he alone is lord of all beings one who knows everything one who resides in everything one who is the root cause of everything and one where all beings which were born meet their end\n these three involving sushupthi and swapna are only illusions\n soul is the only form which is real\n the fourth feet aspect of this four fold soul is thureeya\n it is something which make all others act something which is within everything and it is the active essence beyond jagrat awakening sushupthi sleep and swapna dream \n something about it is as follows it is wiyout macro consciousness\n it is wiyout micro consciousness\n it is wiyout medium consciousness\n it is the personification of consciousness\n it is not something immobile and it is not immobile consciousness\n it cannot be seen\n it cannot be described\n it cannot be understood\n it is something wiyout any identification\n it is something which is unimaginable\n it is something which cannot be pointed out\n it is something which can be perceived only with the firm belief that there is only one soul\n it is that aspect of pancha boothas five elements viz earth air fire water and ether where the entire universe is crashed in\n it is considered as the fourth state after shiva peace santha inner peace wiyout any negative activity and advaita the concept of non dualism \n it is the soul\n it is that thing which has to be understood\n it is that aspect of god which is the knowledge beyond all knowledge and is called thuriya thuriyam\n second chapter the four branches of brahmam which is shining well is full of same essence of happiness is never aging is never dying is full of nectar and which is providing protection should be matched with the four letters branches of om\n the one who knows that the chaturathma viswan on the whole and vaiswanaran partly who are awake and have similarity to the four formed aakara letter aa are spread inside everything in the form of sthoola macro sookshma micro bheeja root and sakshi witness and are the first of everything would realize all his wishes\n he would be the first among every one\n the chaturathma thaijasan on the whole and hiranya garbhan partly who exist in the state of dreams are similar to the four formed letter uu\n this uu has the form of gross micro root and witness\n because of its greatness and because of its double relation the one who knows this through gross micro root and witness aspects would increase the tide of knowledge\n he would possess equanimity along with pleasure and pain\n the chaturathma pragnan on the whole and easwaran partly who are in the state of sleep are similar to the four formed letter ma\n this letter ma also has the forms of gross micro root and witness\n the one who knows this in its aspect of its measurability and its capacity to hide it in itself by macro micro root and witness properties would be able to measure the entire world by his wisdom and would be able to hide everything within himself\n like this we have to pray on the stages of wakefulness sleep and dream by the aa uu and ma letters of om\n the fourth letter is the one which has within itself the easwara\n it is that which can rule by itself it is itself easwara and it has a self glitter\n this soul which is the fourth exists as known and unknown among all beings\n its light is like the kalagni surya sun who is like a fire causing death at the time of the final deluge\n it gives to all itself as soul and would make everything in to itself\n like the sun which swallows darkness this soul which is the unified power exists like fire which remains detached after burning the fuel beyond word and mind and has a holy divine form and is the thuriya\n this is the om\n it is within everything which has a name and form and is the knowledge and the knower\n because it exists as thuriya and has a divine form and is within everything as knowledge and the knower and is detached and formless there are no differences within it\n and so the teaching regarding this is as follows because it is wiyout syllable it is peace shiva it is the place where universe meets the end it is indescribable it has a non dualistic form and is placed in the fourth position and it is om itself\n the soul who understands this in this manner would attain the soul himself\n this valorous hero would understand thuriya using the narsaimha anushtup mantra raja\n this would make the soul shine\n he should deeply meditate on brahmam as something which would destroy everything which cannot be conquered by any one which is everywhere which shines for ever which is devoid of ignorance which is able to cut off his own bondage which is non dual which is personification of happiness which is the basis for everything which exists for ever and which is one wiyout ignorance passion and base qualities\n third chapter meditate deeply on pranava om in the form of chidagni the fire within which is in agni mandala orbit of fire of the mooladhara in the maha peeta consisting of and petal lotus with its family of four worlds earth atmosphere heavens and moon world and seven souls loka vedadevatha gana chanda agni vyahruthi \n then meditate on letter aa which is the chaturathma souls and the sapthathma seven souls as brahma in the belly mani pooraka on letter uu as vishnu in the heart aanahatha on letter ma as rudra in the middle of eyelids aagna on the dot which is the happy nectar form of the soul of omkara sound of om in dwadasantha just above the eyes and the soul athma in the form of sound in shodasantha\n thus after worshipping with nectar ananda amrutha the four fold brahmas devatha teacher mantra and the soul vishnu rudra separately and then together in the form of linga with offerings and then unifying the linga forms in the atma jyothi light of the soul and filling up the macro micro and causal bodies with this light we have to unify atma jyothi which is their basis with macro micro root and witness properties\n afterwards adjust the very gross virat form in the very micro hiranyagarbha form and this micro form in the great causal iswara form and after arranging the mantras similarly and meditating on otha anuj jnathru anugnaavikalpa stages and merging all this in to the omkara sound of om in thuriya we have to reach the nirvikalpa paramathma formless great truth \n fourth chapter thus the soul should be meditated upon nine times as the omkara form of para brahma with thuriya pranava sound\n using anushtup mantra as the ever happy full atma starting with the chants om ugram sachidananda poorna prayourag sadathmanam nrusimham pramathmanam param brahma chinthayami and ending with om mruyourum mruyourum \n then the same prayer nine times with chidathmanam instead of sadathmanam\n then the same prayer times with anandathmanam instead of sadathmanam\n then the same prayer times with poornathmanam instead of sadathmanam and again the same prayer with pratyagathmanam instead of sadathmanam\n meditating well on the five forms of sath chit ananda poorna and atma and pray with the navathmaka mantras and then meditate on the soul using aham self then salute and then unite yourself with brahmam\n example for mantras of namaskara saluting om ugram sachidananda poorna prayourag sadathmanam substitute chidathmanam etc nrusimham paramathmanam param brahma aham namami\n the other alternative is to pray lord narasimha using the anushtup mantra\n he narasimha who is god exists as a human being and also as soul of every one for all times and every where and also as one who destroys attachments and also as god of the universe\n he is the soul of thuriya\n believing he is yourself the one who practices yoga should meditate on the omkara brahmam\n he is the great sage who serves god who establishes the lion with its fame after mutually attracting viswa thaijasa and pragna who are like the sons of atma with pranava which has been pointed out as the bull of vedas after making them wiyout separate identity and finishing them in sakshi chaithanya and afterwards kill the darkness of ignorance using the fame of the lion\n that devotee who after saluting virat hiranya garbha and easwara who have been joined in the horns of pranava and uniting them in the same paramatma principle and then saluting narasimha as described above and make him personally present by methods like ugra very angry and veera great hero would exist in the form similar to narasimha\n fifth chapter that type of practitioner would not have any desire towards worldly things would have all his earlier desires fulfilled and would have desire only on atma soul \n his pranas soul spirits do not start and go any where and would attain their ultimate here itself in brahmam\n he exists as brahmam and attains brahmam\n he who worships the exalted atma in omkara the letter om attains brahmam in the form of narasimham\n he who meditates and venerates the ultimate god in the form of aa uu and ma which is incomparable which is the holy spirit which sees every thing which is the witness of everything which swallows everything which is the darling of every body which is prior to everything and which makes everything else shine would understand and know para brahma\n one who knows like that would shine as god para brahma narasimha\n sixth chapter devas wanted to understand this atma soul \n the asura qualities caught hold of them\n to get rid of that effect they worshipped narasimha who is the thuriya soul which is in the summit of omkara using the anushtup mantra\n then the sin like asura qualities itself became the great light of wisdom which is the prime happiness like poison becoming medicine \n those devas became mentally calm having their sensory organs under control became those who were not attracted by worldly desires became those having patience became those whose conduct became stable became those who were attracted by the atma became those who were having playfulness unity and happiness and became those who realized that om is light of atma which is para brahmam and felt that all other places are empty and merged in to the om \n so the practitioner should do penance like devas stabilize his mind in the omkara para brahmam and would make other people see his atma as para brahmam\n there is a holy stanza about this viz\n after meditating on the horns which are the different parts of pranava and further meditating on the thuriya paramatma which is a horn but not a part add the nrusimha raja mantra to the different parts of pranava\n the three types of devas sathvika rajasa and thamasa serve the pranava in which the first two letters aa and uu are merged and fixed in the third letter ma and make themselves exalted\n seventh chapter adding the first half of the uu with the letter aa and making it as the form of lord narasimha and then using the second half of letter uu on narasimha brahma because it is macro because it is shining because it is famous because it is mahadeva great god because he is maheswara greatest god because it is the best sathva sathvic quality because it is the greatest wisdom because it is the greatest happiness and because it is the greatest lord then unite it with soul which is the meaning of the letter ma\n one who knows this would be wiyout a body wiyout sensory organs wiyout soul wiyout ignorance with the form of sat chit ananda ever lasting bliss and would become as one who attained salvation one who attains swarajya \n therefore one has to meditate on para brahma with the letter aa cross the mind with letter ma and search for that state where one is the witness of the mind\n when one pushes out everything then everything enters in and when he attains awakening of wisdom then everything rises from him\n thus if one meditates catch it set fire and swallow he would become narasimha who is of the form of atma and would establish himself in his own power\n there is a holy stanza about this\n its meaning is like this join aa the first letter of pranava with the first part of its second letter uu and join these together with letter ma and merge it with thuriya brahma which is the meaning of pranava and is a witness beyond the states of waking sleep and dream\n eighth chapter his soul is woven completely from side to side with thuriya\n this with its narasimha form and in which every thing pervades and which is the soul of everything contains everything\n this is the secret and is wiyout form or seed\n this soul is non dualistic and wiyout form or seed\n the word om is non dualistic and is full of wisdom\n narasimha the soul of thuriya and the meaning of omkara are all the same\n this is the unique body of parameshwara lord of every thing \n this is wiyout form or seed\n this which does not have any form or seed does not have differences within\n the one who thinks that there is difference between them breaks into hundred pieces and breaks in to yousand pieces and attains death from death\n this is wiyout a two self resplendent and great joy\n that soul is the ultimate support\n brahmam is the ultimate support\n the one who knows this becomes brahmam which is the ultimate support\n ninth chapter devas approached prajapathi and requested him oh god please tell us about the omkaratma the letter om which is the soul \n he agreed and told them atma stands behind and observes and is with you as a witness\n it is lion a form beyond yought a form wiyout feelings and something which can be attained from every where\n there is nothing second to it which is separate from that\n it is the atma which is ready everywhere\n due to the illusion this atma appears as something different\n from pragna due to the cover of ignorance the world is produced\n for the living being atma is the resplendent paramatma\n because the sensory organs are not able to feel it it is not known even when it is known\n prajapathi told devas see that atma which is resplendent and wiyout second which is before you as i am it and it is me \n has it been seen devas replied yes it has been seen\n it is beyond things which are known and things which are not known\n where has illusion gone now how did illusion disappear prajapathi told them it is not surprising that the illusion has disappeared\n because you are all people with a wonderful form\n there is nothing surprising even in that\n that form of the soul is natural to you all\n understand that is the form of om \n you now tell me what you have understood\n they said it appears as if we have understood it and also appears as if that we have not understood it\n it also appears as if it is beyond all description \n prajapathi told them you have now got the knowledge about the soul \n they told him oh god we are seeing it but we are not seeing it like we see other things\n we do not have capacity to describe it\n oh god salutations to you\n please shower your grace on us\n prajapathi told them if you want to know any thing more please ask me\n they told this knowledge about the soul is a great blessing\n our salutations to you\n thus prajapathi taught them\n there is a stanza about it understand that atma which is spread everywhere by the practice of om\n understand that the atma which does not have any thing which is different and which is in you as the knower is very much within you\n after understanding that stabilize there as a witness who advises \n om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the

there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me the king brihadratha by name had his eldest son installed on the throne and considering the body to be impermanent and feeling disgusted with worldly life went to a penance forest\n there he performed the highest kind of penance and facing the sun remained with his arm uplifted\n at the end of a yousand years the sun god taking the form of the sage sakayanya approached the sage\n like fire blazing wiyout smoke and burning all as it were with his effulgence the sage sakayanya the knower of the self said to the king rise up rise up choose a boon \n bowing to him the king said revered sir i know not the atman\n but we hear that you are a knower of the truth\n expound to me that \n this request of yours is impossible on the very face of it\n do not ask me this question\n oh descendant of ikshvaku choose the fulfilment of other desires \n reverently touching the feet of the sage sakayanya the king gave utterance to the following religious text gatha \n now then why speak of other things there is the drying up of great seas the downfall of mountains the movement of the polestar or of trees the submerging of the earth and the loss of position by the gods\n in this worldly life which is of the nature of distinction between he and i what is the use of enjoying desires as resorting to them there is seen the repeated return to the phenomenal world hence it behoves on your part to uplift me\n i am like a frog in a well in this worldly life\n revered sir you are my refuge \n thus the king said \n revered sir this body is born of sexual union alone is devoid of consciousness and is verily hell as it has emerged through the urinal path full of bones daubed with flesh and encased in skin it is fully filled with faeces urine wind bile phlegm marrow fat fatty exudations and many other filyour things\n remaining in a body of this kind revered sir you are my refuge\n thus he implored \n then the revered sage sakayanya greatly pleased said to the king great king brihadratha you are prominent in the family of the ikshvakus a knower of the atman one who has done his duty well and you are well known by the name of marut\n such is your self\n revered sir who is to be described and he said to the king the objects such as those denoted by sound and touch are apparently a source of danger for the individual self encased in the five elements may not remember the highest goal when attached to them\n through penance one gets to know the inborn disposition sattva from sattva one gets stability of the mind through the mind one realizes the atman by realizing the self worldly life is prevented\n just as fire when fuel is exhausted calms down in itself so the mind when its activity is exhausted becomes quiescent in its source i\n when the mind is calmed down into its source and goes in the true path the results dependent on activities are unreal as the objects of the senses are confounded i\n actions performed do not affect him as he is wiyout attachment \n it is the mind that constitutes worldly life this should be purified\n as the mind so the things appear coloured by it this is the eternal secret\n by the purity of the mind one destroys the effect of good and bad actions\n when with a pure mind one remains in the self one enjoys inexhaustible bliss\n if a person s mind which is well attached to the region of the sense objects were turned towards brahman who will not be released from bondage one should feel the supreme lord to be present in the midst of the lotus of one s heart as the spectator of the dance of the intellect as the abode of supreme love as beyond the range of mind and speech as he rescue ship scattering all worry of those sinking in the sea of worldly life as of the nature of effulgent existence alone as beyond yought as the indispensable as incapable of being grasped by the active mind possessing uncommon attributes the immobile steady and deep neither light nor darkness free from all doubts and semblance and is consciousness consisting of the final beatitude\n that which is the eternal the pure the ever vigilant free from the nature of delusions the true the subtle the supremely powerful the one wiyout a second the ocean of bliss and transcendent that i am the innermost essence of all there is no doubt about it\n how can the danger of duality approach me resorting as i do to the inner bliss of the self who despise the female goblin of desires who view the phenomenal world as in illusion and who am unattached to it those ignorant people who stick to castes and orders of life obtain the worthless fruit of their respective actions\n those who discard the ways of caste etc\n and are happy with the bliss of the self become merged in brahman lit\n the body consisting of various limbs and observing the rules of castes and orders has a beginning and an end and is only a great trouble\n free of attachment to one s children etc\n and the body one should live in the endless supreme happiness\n then the revered sage maitreya went to kailasa\n approaching him the lord he said lord expound to me the secret of the supreme truth \n the great god said to him the body is said to be the temple the individual self jiva is shiva alone\n one should discard the faded flowers in the form of spiritual ignorance and worship god with the conviction he and i are one \n true knowledge consists of seeing non different in all deep meditation consists of the mind freed from thinking on sensory objects bathing is the removal of impurity in the mind and cleansing consists of controlling the senses\n he should imbibe the nectar brahman go about for alms to preserve the body and becoming devoted to the one brahman live in the solitary place of oneness free from duality\n thus should a wise man spend his life he alone will attain liberation\n this body is born and it has death it has originated from the impure secretions of the mother and father it is the abode of joy and sorrow and it is impure\n bathing in the form of discarding attachment to it is ordained when one touches it with the idea that it belongs to one\n it is built up of primary fluids subject to grievous maladies abode of sinful actions transitory and diffused with agitated feelings\n touching this body bathing as aforesaid is ordained\n it always naturally exudes at the appropriate time impure secretions through the nine apertures eyes ears etc\n having impure matter it smells foul\n touching this bathing as aforesaid is ordained\n it is associated with the mother in impurity at birth and is born with the impurity caused by childbirth as it is born associated with death in due course and the impurity caused by child birth touching this body bathing as aforesaid is ordained\n viewing the body as i and mine is smearing oneself with faeces and urine in the place of cosmetics\n thus pure cleansing has been spoken of in the verses above \n cleansing the body with mud and water is the external one pracit ised in the world\n cleansing which purifies the mind consists of the destruction of the three inborn tendencies loka vasana shastra vasana and deha vasana real cleansing is said to be by washing with mud and water in the form of true knowledge and dispassion jnana and vairagya \n feeling of non duality is the alms which is consumed and the feeling of duality is the thing unfit for consumption\n the receiving of alms by the mendicant monk is ordained in accordance with the directions of the guru and the scripture\n after embracing renunciation of his own accord the wise man shall move away from his native place and live far away like a thief who has been released from prison\n no sooner has the ascetic moved away from the son of ego the brother of wealth the home of delusion and the wife of desires than he is liberated from worldly bondage there is no doubt about it\n how shall i perform the twilight worship sandhya i\n there is no need for it when the mother of delusion is just dead and the son of true awakening is born causing two fold impurity how can i perform twilight worship when the bright sun of consciousness ever shines in the sky of the heart and it never sets or rises i\n there is no twilight at all and hence there is no scope for worship \n the conviction which is present from the words of the guru that there is only one reality wiyout a second alone is the solitude necessary for meditation and not a monastery nor the interior of a forest\n there is liberation for those who are free from doubts there is no emancipation even at the end of repeated births for those whose minds are invaded by doubts about the non duality of the atman \n hence one should have faith\n there is no true renunciation by discarding action nor by reciting the mantras of praisa at the formal ceremony of renunciation \n renunciation has been declared to be the oneness of the individual self jiva and the universal self atman \n one to whom all primary desires etc\n such as for wife wealth and progeny appear like vomit and who has discarded pride in his body is entitled to renunciation\n a wise man should embrace renunciation only when there has risen in his mind dispassion for all worldly things otherwise he is fallen\n he who renounces worldly life for amassing wealth contributed by rich disciples or for the sake of assured boarding and clothing or for a stable position as the head of a monastery is doubly fallen i\n he has neither the full pleasures of worldly life nor liberation he does not deserve final beatitude\n the wisest take to contemplation on the reality of brahman the middling ones contemplate on the scripture low people think of the mantras the lowest are deluded by the efficacy of holy places\n a fool in vain takes theoretical delight in brahman wiyout practically experiencing it as i am brahman like the joy of tasting fruits found in the branch of a tree reflected in a lake \n if a sage does not give up the inward conviction of non duality in the collecting of alms from various houses as a bee does honey from flowers the father in the form of dispassion the wife of faith and the son of true knowledge he is liberated\n people rich in wealth old in age and similarly those mature in knowledge all these are but servants nay the servants of the disciples of those who are mature in wisdom\n even learned people have their minds deluded by the illusion created by me and wiyout realizing me the atman who am omnipresent they but wander like cows to fill the wretched belly to one desiring liberation worship of idols made of stone metal gem and clay results only in the experience of rebirth hence the sage should perform the worship of his heart alone i\n contemplate on brahman enshrined in his heart non different from the self \n to prevent rebirth he shall avoid external worship of idols \n he who is full inwardly and outwardly is like a jar filled in the sea he who is empty inwardly and empty outwardly is like a jar empty in the sky\n do not become one enjoying objects of the senses do not also become one believing in the senses\n rejecting all ideations become that which remains\n discarding ideas of seer seeing and what is seen along with inward tendencies may you resort only to the atman who is the prime source of all phenomena\n that state of remaining like a stone with all ideations quiescent and freed from the states of waking and sleeping is the supreme state of the self in the disembodied state \n thus ends the instruction given by lord shiva and the second chapter \n i am i i am the other the supreme one i am brahman i am the source of all i am also the guru of all the

heart\n i am devoid of the six changes of birth etc\n i am wiyout the six sheaths the gross material body etc\n i am free from the group of six internal enemies passions etc\n and i am the witness

effulgence i am the effulgence of pure consciousness\n i am beyond the three durations past present and future and i am free from passion etc\n i am above the body and its dweller and i am unique devoid of attributes\n i am beyond liberation i am liberated and i am always devoid of final emancipation\n i am above truth and untruth i am always nothing other than pure existence\n i am not obliged to go to any place being free of movement etc\n i am always equanimous i am quiescence the greatest being purushottama one who has his own experience thus is wiyout doubt myself\n he who listens to this experience even once with supreme faith becomes himself i\n becomes merged into brahman\n thus ends the upanishad\n om let my limbs and speech prana eyes ears vitality and all the senses grow in strength\n all existence is the brahman of the upanishads\n may i never deny brahman nor brahman deny me\n let there be no denial at all let there be no denial at least from me\n may

    "Subala": "om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me lesson one the subsistence and dissolution of the universe the unqualified brahman they say what existed he replied neither the existent nor the non existent\n from that tamas was born from tamas was born bhitadi prakriti matter from it space from space air from air fire from fire water and from water earth\n this became the egg which existing for just a year became two fold earth below and sky above\n between was divine man with a yousand heads eyes feet and arms virat purusha \n he at first created the death of all creatures having three eyes heads and feet armed with an axe\n brahma was afraid he entered brahma himself he created seven mental sons they created seven virats the pro creators\n his face was brahmana arms were made into kshatriya thighs became the vaishya sudra was born from the feet air and vital air prana from his ear all this is from his heart\n thus the first section \n from the apana were created nisadas yakshas etc\n from the bones mountains from the hair plants and trees from the forehead rudra of anger \n the breath of this great being became rik and other vedas phonetics kalpa the manual of ritual grammar etymology metre logic astronomy exegetic law comments glosses etc\n the golden light in which dwell the self all worlds made itself into two woman and man\n becoming deva created devas becoming rishi created rishis also yakshas etc\n as well as wild as wild and domestic animals bull and cow horse and mare male and female donkey earth and the boar\n at the end becoming vaisvanara fire he burned destroyed all creatures earth was absorbed in water water in fire fire in air air in ether ether in sense organs they in subtle elements they in prakriti prakriti in mahat mahat in avyakta avyakta in akshara akshara in tamas it in god\n then there is neither existent nor non existent\n this is the doctrine of dissolution as given in vedas\n thus the second section lesson two the fourth principle \n in the beginning this was non existent\n the man of wisdom does grow meditating upon the atman which has no birth no rising nor setting unestablished having no sound touch form taste smell decay nor any thing bigger\n wiyout vital breath face ears speech mind radiance eyes name lineage head hands or feet smoothness blood measurability neither long short nor gross nor atomic shoreless beyond description not open nor illuminable nor closed wiyout inside or outside it neither eats nor is eaten\n one can achieve realize this only by means of truth charity undying austerity celibacy detachment with six parts\n he shall observe the three self control munificence and compassion\n his vital airs do not depart but merge here in brahman\n thus the third section \n in the midst of the heart is a mass of red flesh in which is the dahara of lotus in shape blossoming in many ways like lily there are ten holes in the heart where the vital airs are established\n when the jiva is connected with prana then he sees rivers and cities of many kinds when with vyana he sees devas and rishis with apana yakshas etc\n with udana the celestial worlds gods skanda and jayanta with samana wealth also with vairambha prana sees what is seen heard eaten and not eaten visible and invisible\n then these nadis become hundred from these branch out seventy two yousand nadis in which the self sleeps and makes noises in the second sheath he sleeps and sees this world and the other hears all sounds this they call clarity\n prana defends the body\n the nadis are filled with green blue yellow red and white blood\n this dahara lotus is blooming in many ways like a lily and like hair so also the nadis are placed in the heart\n the divine self sleeps in the great sheath when there are no desires no sleep even there are no devas or their worlds yagas mother father kinsmen no thieves or brahmana killer\n all this is water again by the same path he returns to wakefulness this samraj\n thus the fourth section \n the supreme being assigns places to their owners the nadi is their link\n the eye is the owner in the body amidst the elements what is seen in the divinity the artery is the link\n he that is in the eye in the sun artery vital air knowledge bliss heart s sky he that moves inside all these is the self\n meditate on that self that is ageless deathless fearless endless\n the ear is the owner in the body amidst the elements the guardians of the quarters the deity the artery is the link\n he that is in the ear audible objects in the quarters etc\n he that moves inside all this is the self\n meditate on that self who is ageless deathless fearless painless endless\n the nose is the owner in the body the smellable is the elemental\n the earth is the deity the artery is the link\n he that is in the nose etc\n the tongue is the owner of the body the savourable is the elemental\n varuna is the deity the artery is the link\n he that is in the tongue etc\n the skin is the owner of the body the touchable is the elemental vayu is the deity the artery is the link\n he that is in the skin etc\n the mind is the owner the thinkable things are the elemental the moon is the deity the artery is the link\n he that is in the mind etc\n intellect is the owner the cognizable is the elemental\n brahma the deity etc\n he that is in the intellect etc\n ego is the owner object of the i concept is the elemental rudra the deity he that is the ego meditate on him\n speech the owner utterable the elemental fire the deity he that is meditate on him\n the mind stuff is the owner the apprehensible is the elemental the jiva is the deity meditate on him\n the hands are the owners what is grasped is the elemental indra the deity he that is in the hands etc\n the feet are the owners the destination is the elemental vishnu the deity he that is in the feet etc\n the male organ is the owner the delectable is the elemental prajapati is the deity he that is in the male organ etc\n he is the omniscient almighty inner ruler source of all waited on by all bliss but does not wait on bliss waited on by vedas and shastras but not waiting on them whose food all this is but who is never food agent and governor of all leadings made of food soul of elements made of prana soul of senseorgans made of mind soul of yought made of knowledge soul of time made of bliss soul of dissolution\n there is oneness how can there be duality no mortality how immortality not cognisant inwardly or outwardly or both ways not a mass of knowledge neither knowing nor not knowing\n thus the fifth section lesson three \n in the beginning there was nothing here these creatures are born sans root and support\n narayana is the eye as well as the visible ear as well as the audible nose and the scentable tongue and the tastable skin and the tactile mind and the thinkable intellect and its contents ego and its field speech and its contents hands feet their fields anus and genital all are narayana\n supporter ordainer transformer all is he\n adityas rudras maruts vasus asvins rik yajus sama mantras agni oblation all are narayana so also mothers fathers etc\n viraja sudarsana jita saumya amogha kumara amrita satya madhyama nasira sisura asura surya bhasvati are the names\n roars sings blows rains varuna aryama chandra kala kavi dhata brahma indra days and half days moments as well as ages all are he\n all this is purusha only the past and the future that high place of vishnu the suris sages look upon this always like the eye spread in the sky\n the sages wiyout mental conflict enhance its glory\n this is the doctrine of liberation according to the vedas\n thus the sixth section lesson four the nature of the inner controller \n the unborn sole immortal being inside the body whose body is the earth and who moves inside the body unknown to the earth who moves inside water as the body unknown to it who moves inside fire unknown to it who moves inside air unknown to it so also inside mind intellect ego chitta mindstuff avyakta unmanifest akshara imperishable death he is the inner sinless self divine narayana\n this he adibrahmaa imported to apantaratamas vishnu vishnu to brahma he to ghorangiras who gave it to raikva who gave it to rama\n he gave it to all living beings\n such is the doctrine of nirvana according to vedas\n thus the seventh section lesson five the self in the body in this body of fat flesh moisture is placed this pure self of all within the cave\n the wise behold the immortal luminous bliss bodiless and imponderable enshrined in this cave the master of all formless massed splendour pure detached divinely shining the self that exceeds and whose form is imponderable\n they behold it by sublation in this body that is as fickle as bubbles in water empty like the plantain pith a city in the sky a painted wall very much conditioned\n thus the eighth section then raikva asked sir into what do all things set he answered the visible disappears in the eye it is resolved in the self in the eye\n the visible disappears in the sun it is resolved in the sun\n what disappears in the virat cosmic man is resolved in the self in the virat\n what disappears in the prana is resolved in the prana\n what disappears in vijnana cognition is resolved in the self in the vijnana\n what disappears in ananda is resolved in ananda bliss \n what disappears in the turiya is resolved in turiya\n that self is immortal fearless painless infinite seedless\n all things are resolved in that self so said he\n he who knows this seedless brahman himself becomes seedless\n he does not get birth and death is not deluded nor pierced or burned does not tremble or get angry they say he is the self the burner of all\n this self is not got by hundreds of expositions not by great learning nor by reliance on intellectual knowledge nor through power of memory vedas sacrifices austerities sankhya or yoga ashramas elucidation laudation and exercises\n the vedic scholars achieve it having become calm restrained withdrawn tolerant and concentrating\n thus the nineth section then raikva asked sir in what are all these established he replied in the rasatalas \n he asked in what are the rasatalas woven warp and woof in the bhu regions \n in what are bhu woven in suvar \n in what are suvar woven in mahar \n in what are mahar woven in janas \n in what are janas woven in tapas \n in what are tapas woven in prajapati s region \n in what are these woven in brahma s region \n all the worlds are extended warp and woof in the brahman like gems in a string thus he spoke\n whoever knows these worlds as extended in the self indeed becomes the self\n this is the doctrine of nirvana of the vedas\n thus the tenth section lesson six the upward path then raikva asked him sir this mass of knowledge moving upwards what place does he leave when departing upwards he replied in the centre of the heart is a red mass of flesh in it a small white lotus blooming like a lily in many ways\n in its centre is a sea with a shining space in the middle\n four arteries are these rama arama iccha apunarbhava pleasing not pleasing desire and not born again \n of these rama leads to the world of merit through merit arama to the world of demerit through demerit\n by iccha one reaches what one thinks of\n by apunarbhava he breaks through the sheath kosa then the cranium earth water fire air ether mind elements mahat avyakta akshara mrityu\n this mrityu becomes one with the supreme deity\n beyond that there is neither being nor non being nor their combination\n this is the doctrine of nirvana of the vedas\n thus the eleventh section lesson seven samadhi from narayana arose raw food ignorance of atman at the beginning of brahma s day at the end of the day the deluges is cooked in aditya\n are again cooked in the gastric fire\n eat only what is fresh not meant for another do not beg for it\n thus the twelfth section \n the sage should desire to be with child like nature which is unattached faultless\n through silence learning free from obligation is got aloneness\n prajapati said knowing the great place one should live at the base of a tree ill clad friendless alone in samadhi desiring the self alone having won all desired objects desireless desires eroded\n he is not afraid of elephants lions flies mongoose snakes etc\n knowing as forms of death\n one should remain like a tree he shall not become angry even when cut down or tremble like stone like sky he shall remain with truth\n the heart of all smells is earth of tastes water of forms fire of touchless air of sounds ether\n avyakta is the heart of all movements mrityu of all sattvas living beings \n death indeed becomes one with the supreme deity\n beyond it there is neither being nor non being nor their combination this is the doctrine of nirvana of the vedas\n thus the thirteenth section lesson eight the earth is indeed the food water is the eater water is the food fire the eater fire is the food air is the eater air is the food ether the eater mind the food intellect the eater intellect the food avyakta the eater avyakta the food akshara imperishable is the eater akshara the food death is the eater it becomes one in the supreme deity beyond which there is neither existence nor non existence this is the vedic doctrines of liberation\n thus the fourteenth section lesson nine burning the principles bases the raikva asked sir this mass of knowledge the spirit when he departs which does he burn the reply he burns prana apana vyana udana samana vairambha mukhya antaryama prabhanja kumara syena sveta krishna naga also prithvi etc\n from jagarita upto turiya lokaloka dharma and adharma regions wiyout the sun wiyout limits and light mrityu becomes one with the supreme deity this is the vedic lecture of liberation \n thus the fifteenth section lesson ten imparting brahmavidya the secret doctrine of subala should not be taught to one who is not tranquil one who is not son or disciple one who stays for less than a year whose family and character are unknown\n to one supremely devoted to god and so to the preceptor these ideas reveal themselves to the great soul this is the doctrine of liberation according to vedas\n thus the sixteenth section om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let

is liberation what is to be adored who is the disciple who is the sage who is the deluded what is the demoniac what is austerity which is the supreme abode what is to be sought after what is to be

knowledge and ends\n it is non dual and free from all adjuncts\n it is big with all powers and is wiyout beginning and end\n it may be spoken of as pure good quiescent unqualified\n god is the veritable brahman that depending on its power called prakriti creates the worlds and enters into them as the inner controller of brahma etc\n he is ishvara as he controls the intellect and the sense organs\n the living being jiva is he who through false superimposition affirms i am gross due to the name and form of brahma vishnu isana indra etc\n jiva thinks though i am one due to the differences of the causes that originate the body the jivas are many\n prakriti is but the power of brahman it is intellectual in nature and competent to create the variegated and marvellous world from the matrix of brahman\n the supreme self is brahman alone being altogether different from body etc\n brahma vishnu indra the god of death the sun the moon the gods the demons men women animals etc\n the immobile the brahmanas etc\n are that very spirit\n neither skin nor blood nor flesh nor bone has caste to self is caste ascribed through mere usage\n i do the deeds that are done through sense organs the deed thus done as centred in the self alone is the deed in question \n the deed done with conceit as agent and enjoyer causing birth etc\n binds the non deed is the obligatory and occasional action sacrifice holy vow austerity gifts etc\n done wiyout desire for their fruit\n knowledge is the immediate realization due to the disciplining of body and sense organs service rendered to the teacher hearing thinking and meditation that there is nothing but spirit the essence of both subjects and objects which is immutable among the mutables like pots and clothes the same in all their innermost essence \n ignorance is the illusory knowledge like that of the snake in the rope of brahman that is all in all all pervasive and non dual\n this illusory knowledge is associated with a plurality of selves based on the plurality of the adjuncts of bondage and liberation viz\n stations in life castes men women the immobiles mankind lower animals and gods\n pleasure is the blissful state that succeeds the knowledge of the essence of being intelligence and bliss\n it dukha pain is the mere sankalpa or the thinking of the objects of mundane existence or of not self \n heaven is the association with the holy\n association with the worldly folk who are unholy alone is hell\n bondage consists in imagining due to the beginningless latent impressions of nescience i am born etc\n bondage consists in imagining a plunge into the flux of existence with its possessive claims on fields gardens houses children wives brothers mothers and fathers\n bondage is the conceit of egoistic agency in regard to actions etc\n bondage is the imagination prompted by the desire for the eight powers anima etc\n bondage is the imagination prompted by the yearning for adoring gods men etc\n bondage is the imagination leading to the practice of yoga with its eight limbs yama etc\n bondage is the planning of action and duties bound up with castes and stations of life\n bondage is to imagine that atman has qualities like doubts fear etc\n bondage is to plan to acquire knowledge to perform sacrifices vows austerity and make gifts\n bondage is to plan to devote oneself exclusively to moksha\n bondage is what springs exclusively from imagination\n liberation is the attenuation through discrimination between the eternal and the ephemeral of the sense of ownership in regard to objects that generate fleeting pleasures and pains in the transmigratory life\n adorable is the teacher who leads one to brahman the spirit dwelling in all bodies\n the disciple is brahman indeed that remains altogether immersed in the knowledge of the world as obliterated by the awareness of its ground viz\n the sage is the knower of the essence of self awareness present in all as their innermost part \n the deluded is he who is sustained by the conceit of egoism as regards agency etc\n demoniac is the austerity rooted in entrenched attachment aversion destructive violence hypocrisy etc\n that torments oneself by performing repetition of holy names and agnihotra while fasting and that is prompted by the desire to secure the power of gods like brahma vishnu indra and isana\n austerity is the burning in the fire of immediate realization of the world s falsity of the seed of imagination fashioned by the desire to secure the power of brahma etc\n the supreme abode is brahman s status one of eternal freedom comprising being intelligence and bliss beyond the qualities of the inner organ and the sense organs and the vital breaths\n to be sought after is the essence of the pure spirit undetermined by space time and objects\n to be rejected is the yought that true is the world other than one s own self that is perceived by the false sense organs and the intellect\n the sannyasin

from the guru then yought about it and meditation this is the cause of full knowledge\n other knowledge will surely perish while the knowledge of brahman leads to brahman\n the guru should instruct the words of the upanishad with the limbs not merely the words these are brahma s words\n ishvara said o suka thus being instructed by me as requested by vyasa you will become jivanmukta \n the svara

bindu the seed or source of spiritual light which is the atma of the universe which is seated in the heart which is of the size of an atom which pertains to shiva which is quiescent and which is gross and subtle as also above these qualities\n that alone should be the dhyana of the munis as well as of men which is full of pains which is difficult to meditate on which is difficult to perceive which is the emancipated one which is decayless and which is difficult to attain\n one whose food is moderate whose anger has been controlled who has given up all love for society who has subdued his passions who has overcome all pairs heat and cold etc\n who has given up his egoism who does not bless anyone nor take anything from others \n and also who goes where they naturally ought not to go and naturally would not go where they like to go such persons also obtain three in the face\n hamsa is said to have three seats\n therefore know it is the greatest of mysteries wiyout sleep and wiyout support\n it is very subtle of the form of soma and is the supreme seat of vishnu\n that seat has three faces three gunas and three dhatus and is formless motionless changeless sizeless and supportless\n that seat is wiyout upadhi and is above the reach of speech and mind\n it is svabhava self or nature reachable only by bhava being \n the indestructible seat is associateless wiyout bliss beyond mind difficult to perceive emancipated and changeless\n it should be meditated upon as the liberated the eternal the permanent and the indestructible\n it is brahman is adhyatma or the deity presiding as atma and is the highest seat of vishnu\n it is inconceivable of the nature of chidatma and above the akasa\n it is void and non void and beyond the void and is abiding in the heart\n there is in it neither meditation nor meditator nor the meditated nor the non meditated\n it is not the universe\n it is the highest space it is neither supreme nor above the supreme\n it is inconceivable unknowable non truth and not the highest\n it is realised by the munis but the devas do not know the supreme one\n avarice delusion fear pride passion anger sin \n heat cold hunger thirst yought and fancy all these do not exist in it \n in it there is no pride of belonging to the brahmana caste nor is there the collection of the knot of salvation\n in it there is no fear no happiness no pains neither fame nor disgrace\n that which is wiyout these states is the supreme brahman\n yama forbearance niyama religious observance tyaga renunciation mouna silence according to time and place asana posture mulabandha seeing all bodies as equal the position of the eye \n prana samyamana control of breath pratyahara subjugation of the senses dharana atmadhyana and samadhi these are spoken of as the parts of yoga in order\n that is called yama in which one controls all his organs of sense and actions through the vijnana that all is brahman this should be pracit ised often and often\n niyama in which there is the supreme bliss enjoyed through the flowing or inclination of the mind towards things of the same spiritual kind viz\n brahman and the abandoning of things differing from one another is pracit ised by the sages as a rule\n in tyaga renunciation one abandons the manifestation or objects of the universe through the cognition of atman that is sat and chit\n this is pracit ised by the great and is the giver of immediate salvation\n mouna the silence in which wiyout reaching that speech returns along with mind is fit to be attained by the yogins and should be ever worshipped by the ignorant even \n how is it possible to speak of that from which speech returns how should it be described as the universe as there is no word to describe it \n it is that which is really called silence and which is naturally understood as such \n there is silence in children but with words latent whereas the knowers of brahman have it silence but wiyout words\n that should be known as the lonely seat in which there is no man in the beginning middle or end and through which all this universe is fully pervaded\n the illusion of brahma and all other beings takes place within one twinkling of his eye \n that should be known as asana posture in which one has with ease and wiyout fatigue uninterrupted meditation of brahman that is described by the word kala time that is endless bliss and that is secondless\n everything else is the destroyer of happiness\n that is called siddhasana siddha posture in which the siddhas psychical personages have succeeded in realising the endless one as the support of the universe containing all the elements etc\n that is called the mulabandha which is the mula root of all worlds and through which the root chitta is bandha bound\n it should be always pracit ised by the rajayogins\n one after having known the equality of the angas or parts of yoga point to one and the same brahman should be absorbed in that equal or uniform brahman if not there is not that equality attained \n then like a dry tree there is straightness or uniformity throughout \n making one s vision full of spiritual wisdom one should look upon the world as full of brahman\n that vision is very noble\n it is generally aimed at the tip of the nose \n but it should be directed towards that seat of brahman wherein the cessation of seer the seen and sight will take place and not towards the tip of the nose\n that is called pranayama the control of breath in which there is the control of the modifications of mind through the cognition of brahman in all the states of chitta and others\n the checking of the conception of the reality of the universe is said to be expiration\n the conception of i am brahman is inspiration\n the holding on long to this conception wiyout agitation is cessation of breath\n such is the practice of the enlightened\n the ignorant close their nose\n that should be known as pratyahara through which one sees atman even in the objects of sense and pleases chitta through manas\n it should be pracit ised often and often\n through seeing brahman wherever the mind goes the dharana is meant that state where one indulges in the good yought \n i am brahman alone and is wiyout any support\n this dhyana is the giver of supreme bliss\n being first in a state of changelessness and then thoroughly forgetting even that state owing to the cognition of the true nature of brahman this is called samadhi\n this kind of bliss should be pracit ised or enjoyed by a wise person till his cognition itself united in a moment with the state of pratyag atman \n then this king of yogins becomes a siddha and is wiyout any aid outside himself \n then he will attain a state inexpressible and unthinkable\n when samadhi is pracit ised the following obstacles arise with great force absence of right inquiry laziness inclination to enjoyment \n absorption in material object tamas distraction impatience sweat and absent mindedness\n all these obstacles should be overcome by inquirers into brahman\n through bhava vritit is worldly youghts one gets into them\n through sunya vritit is void or empty youghts one gets into them\n but through the vritit is of brahman one gets fullness\n therefore one should develop fullness through this means of brahman \n he who abandons this vritti of brahman which is very purifying and supreme that man lives in vain like a beast\n but he who understands this vritti of brahman and having understood it makes advances in it becomes a good and blessed person deserving to be worshipped by the three worlds\n those who are greatly developed through the ripening of their past karmas attain the state of brahman others are simply reciters of words\n those who are clever in arguments about brahman but are wiyout the action pertaining to brahman and who are greatly attached to the world those certainly are born again and again in this world through their ajnana \n the former never remain even for half a moment wiyout the vritti of brahman like brahma and others sanaka etc\n when a cause is subject to changes it as an effect must also have its cause\n when the cause ceases to exist in truth the effect perishes through right discrimination\n then that substance or principle which is beyond the scope of words remains pure\n after that vritti jnana arises in their purified mind through meditation with transcendental energy there arises a firm certitude\n after reducing the visible into the invisible state one should see everything as brahman\n the wise should ever stay in bliss with their understanding full of the essence of chit\n thus ends the first chapter\n chapter ii then the kumara asked shiva please explain to me the nature of chinmatra that is the partless nondual essence \n the great shiva replied the partless non dual essence is the visible\n it is the world it is the existence it is the self it is mantra it is action it is spiritual wisdom it is water\n it is the earth it is akasa it is the books it is the three vedas it is the brahman it is the religious vow it is jiva it is aja the unborn it is brahma it is vishnu it is rudra it is i it is atman it is the guru\n it is the aim it is sacrifice it is the body it is manas it is chitta it is happiness it is vidya it is the undifferentiated it is the eternal it is the supreme it is everything\n o six faced one different from it there is nothing\n none none but it it is i\n it is gross it is subtle it is knowable it is you it is the mysterious it is the knower it is existence it is mother it is father it is brother it is husband it is sutra atman it is virat\n it is the body it is the head it is the internal it is the eternal it is full it is nectar it is gotra clan it is griha the house it is the preservable it is the moon it is the stars it is the sun it is the holy seat\n it is forgiveness it is patience it is the gunas it is the witness\n it is a friend it is a relative it is an ally it is the king town kingdom and subjects\n it is om japa meditation the seat the one woryour to be taken in the heart the jyoit is swarga heaven and self \n all the partless and non dual essence should be regarded as chinmatra\n chinmatra alone is the absolute consciousness and this partless non dual essence alone is the real essence\n all having consciousness alone except those having changes are chinmatra\n all this is chinmatra\n he is chinmaya the state of atman is known as chinmatra and the partless non dual essence\n the whole world is chinmatra\n your state and my state are chinmatra\n akasa earth water vayu agni brahma vishnu shiva and all else that exist or do not are chinmatra\n that which is the partless non dual essence is chinmatra\n all the past present and future are chinmatra\n substance and time are chinmatra\n knowledge and the knowable are chinmatra\n the knower is chinmatra\n every speech is chinmatra\n whatever else is chinmatra\n asat and sat are chinmatra\n the beginning and end are chinmatra that which is in the beginning and end is chinmatra ever\n the guru and the disciple are chinmatra\n if the seer and the seen are chinmatra then they are always chinmaya\n all things wondrous are chinmatra\n the gross body is chinmatra as also subtle and causal bodies\n there is nothing beyond chinmatra\n i and you are chinmatra\n form and non form are chinmatra\n virtue and vice are chinmatra\n the body is a symbol of chinmatra\n sankalpa knowing mantra and others the gods invoked in mantras \n the gods presiding over the eight quarters the phenomenal and the supreme brahman are nothing but chinmatra\n there is nothing wiyout chinmatra\n maya is nothing wiyout chinmatra\n puja worship is nothing wiyout chinmatra\n meditation truth sheaths and others the eight vasus silence non silence and indifference to objects are nothing wiyout chinmatra\n everything is from chinmatra\n whatever is seen and however seen it is chinmatra so far\n whatever exists and however distant is chinmatra\n whatever elements exist whatever is perceived and whatever is vedanta all these are chinmatra\n wiyout chinmatra there is no motion no moksha and no goal aimed at\n brahman that is the partless non dual essence is known to be nothing but chinmatra\n thou o lord art the partless non dual essence stated in the books in me in thee and in the ruler\n he who thus perceives i as of one homogeneity pervading everywhere will at once be emancipated through this spiritual wisdom\n he is his own guru with this profound spiritual wisdom\n thus ends the second chapter\n chapter iii the kumara addressed his father again please explain to me the realisation of atman \n to which the great shiva said i am of the nature of the parabrahmaan\n

of jivanmukti embodied salvation and videhamukti disembodied salvation \n to which the great shiva replied \n i am para atma\n i am the nirguna greater than the great\n one who will simply stay in

realises i have no chitta no buddhi no ahamkara no sense no body at any time no pranas no maya no passion and no anger i am the great i have nothing of these objects or of the world and i have no sin no characteristics no eye no manas no ear no nose no tongue no hand no waking no dreaming or causal state in the least or the fourth state\n he is said to be a jivanmukta who realises all this is not

chapter\n chapter v the sage named nidagha addressed the venerable ribhu o lord please explain to me the discrimination of atman from non atman \n the sage replied thus the furthest limit of all vak speech is brahman the furthest limit to all youghts is the guru\n that which is of the nature of all causes and effects but yet wiyout them that which is wiyout sankalpa of the nature of all bliss and the auspicious that which is the great one of the nature of bliss that which illuminates all luminaries and that which is full of the bliss of nada spiritual sound wiyout any enjoyment and contemplation and beyond nadas and kalas parts that is atman that is i the indestructible\n being devoid of all the difference of atman and non atman of heterogeneity and homogeneity and of quiescence and non quiescence that is the one jyoit is at the end of nada\n being remote from the conception of maha vakyartha i\n the meaning of maha vakyas as well of i am brahman being devoid of or wiyout the conception of the word and the meaning and being devoid of the conception of the destructible and indestructible that is the one jyoit is at the end of nada\n being wiyout the conception i am the partless non dual essence or i am the blissful and being of the nature of the one beyond all that is one jyoit is at the end of nada\n he who is devoid of the significance of atman viz\n motion and devoid of sachchidananda he is alone atman the eternal\n he who is undefinable and unreachable by the words of the vedas who has neither externals nor internals and whose symbol is either the universe or brahman he is undoubtedly atman\n he who has no body nor is a jiva made up of the elements and their compounds who has neither form nor name neither the enjoyable nor the enjoyer neither sat nor asat neither preservation nor regeneration neither guna nor non guna that is undoubtedly my atman\n he who has neither the described nor description neither sravana nor manana neither guru nor disciple neither the world of the devas nor the devas nor the asuras neither duty nor nonduty neither the immaculate nor non immaculate neither time nor non time neither certainty nor doubt neither mantra nor non mantra neither science nor non science neither the seer nor the sight which is subtle nor the nectar of time that is atman\n rest assured that not atman is a misnomer\n there is no manas as not atman\n there is no world as not atman\n owing to the absence of all sankalpas and to the giving up of all actions brahman alone remains and there is no not atman\n being devoid of the three bodies the three periods of time the three gunas of jiva the three pains and the three worlds and following the saying all is brahman know that there is nothing to be known through the absence of chitta there is no old age through the absence of body no motion through the absence of legs no action through the absence of hands no death through the absence of creatures no happiness through the absence of buddhi no virtue no purity no fear no repetition of mantras no guru nor disciple\n there is no second in the absence of one\n where there is not the second there is not the first\n where there is truth alone there is no non truth possible where there is non truth alone there is no truth possible\n if you regard a thing auspicious as inauspicious then auspiciousness is desired as separate from inauspiciousness\n if you regard fear as non fear then fear will arise out of non fear\n if bondage should become emancipation then in the absence of bondage will be no emancipation\n if birth should imply death then in the absence of birth there is no death\n if you should imply i then in the absence of you there is no i \n if this should be that this does not exist in the absence of that \n if being should imply non being then non being will imply being\n if an effect implies a cause then in the absence of effect there is no cause\n if duality implies non duality then in the absence of duality there is no non duality\n if there should be the seen then there is the eye or sight in the absence of the seen there is no eye\n in the absence of the interior there is no exterior\n if there should be fullness then non fullness is possible\n therefore all this exists nowhere\n neither you nor i nor this nor these exist\n there exists no object of comparison in the true one\n there is no simile in the unborn\n there is in it no mind to think\n i am the supreme brahman\n this world is brahman only\n thou and i are brahman only\n i am chinmatra simply and there is no

than the great the supreme brahman guru of gurus the support of all and the bliss of bliss\n there is no universe besides atman\n the universe is of the nature of atman\n there is nowhere or no place

brahman\n there is nothing different from brahman like i ness or you ness\n whatever is seen in this world whatever is spoken of by the people whatever is enjoyed everywhere all these are asat unreal only\n the differences arising from the actor action qualities likes taste and gender all these arise from asat and are but pleasurable\n the differences arising from time objects actions success or defeat and whatever else all these are simply asat\n the internal organ is asat\n the organs are asat\n all the pranas the collections of all these the five sheaths the five deities the six changes the six enemies the six seasons and the six tastes are asat\n the universe is rootless\n i am atman alone chit and ananda\n the scenes of mundane existence are not different\n i am the truth of the nature of ananda and the nature of the imponderable chit\n all this is of the nature of jnana\n i am the secondless having jnana and bliss\n i am of the nature of an illuminator of all things\n i am of the nature of all non being\n i alone shine always\n therefore how can i with such a nature become asat that which is called you is the great brahman of the nature of the bliss of consciousness and of the nature of chit having chidakasha and chit alone as the great bliss\n atman alone is i \n asat is not i \n i am kutastha the great guru and sachchidananda alone\n i am this born universe\n no time no universe no maya no prakriti in me \n i alone am the hari\n personally i alone am the sadashiva\n i am of the nature of pure consciousness\n i am the enjoyer of pure sattva\n i am the only essence full of chit\n everything is brahman and brahman alone\n everything is brahman and is chit alone\n i am of the nature of the all latent and the all witness\n i am the supreme atman the supreme jyoit is the supreme wealth the supreme goal the essence of all vedantas the subject discussed in all the shastras the nature of yogic bliss the ocean of the chief bliss the brightness of all wisdom of the nature of chief wisdom the brightness of the fourth state and the non fourth but devoid of them the indestructible chit truth vasudeva the birthless and the deathless brahma chidakasha the unconditioned the stainless the immaculate the emancipated the utterly emancipated the soulless the formless and of the nature of the non created universe\n the universe which is assumed as truth and non truth does not really exist\n brahman is of the nature of eternal bliss and is even by itself\n it is endless decayless quiescent and of one nature only\n if anything is other than myself then it is as unreal as the mirage in an oasis\n if one should be afraid of the son of a barren woman or if a powerful elephant be killed by means of the horns of a hare then the world really is \n if one person can quench his thirst by drinking the waters of the mirage or if one should be killed by the horns of a man then the universe really is\n the universe exists always in the true gandharva city merely unreal \n when the blueness of the sky really exists in it then the universe really is\n when the silver in mother of pearl can be used in making an ornament when a man is bitten by the conception of a snake in a rope when the flaming fire is quenched by means of a golden arrow when milky food is obtained in the barren forest of vindhya mountains when cooking can take place by means of the fuel of wet plantain trees when a female baby just born begins to cook when curds resume the state of milk or when the milk milked goes back through the teats of a cow then will the universe really be\n when the dust of the earth shall be produced in the ocean when the maddened elephant is tied by means of the hair of a tortoise when mountain meru is shaken by the thread in the stalk of a lotus when the ocean is bound by its rows of tides when the fire flames downwards when flame shall become really cold when the lotus shall grow out of flaming fire when indranila sapphire arises in the great mountains when meru comes and sits in the lotus eye when a mountain can become the offspring of a black bee when meru shall shake when a lion is killed by goat when the three worlds can be found in the space of the hollow of an atom when the fire which burns a straw shall last for a long time when the objects seen in a dream shall come in the waking state when the current of a river shall stand still of itself when the delivery of a barren woman shall be fruitful when the crow shall walk like a swan when the mule shall fight with a lion when a great ass shall walk like an elephant when the full moon shall become a sun when rahu one of the nodes shall abandon the sun and the moon when a good crop shall arise out of the waste burnt seeds when the poor shall enjoy the happiness of the rich when the lions shall be conquered by the bravery of dogs when the heart of jnanis is known by fools when the ocean is drunk by the dogs wiyout any remainder when the pure akasa shall fall upon men when heaven shall fall on the earth when the flower in the sky shall emit fragrance when a forest appearing in pure akasa shall move and when reflection shall arise in a glass simply wiyout mercury or anything else in its back then the world really is\n there is no universe in the womb of aja the unborn brahman there is no universe in the womb of atman\n duality and non duality which are but the results of differentiation are really not\n all this is the result of maya\n therefore there should be brahma bhavana\n if misery should arise from the conception of i am the body then it is certain i am brahman \n the knot of the heart is the wheel of brahman which cuts asunder the knot of existence\n when doubt arises in one he should have faith in brahman\n that non dual brahman which is eternal and of the form of unconditioned bliss is the guard of atman against the chief of the form of not atman\n through instances like the above is established the nature of brahman\n brahman alone is the allabode\n abandon the name even of the universe\n knowing for certain i am brahman give up the i \n everything disappears as the flower from the hands of a sleeping person\n there is neither body nor karma\n everything is brahman alone\n there are neither objects nor actions nor the four states\n everything which has the three characteristics of vijnana is brahman alone\n abandoning all action contemplate \n i am brahman i am brahman \n there is no doubt of this\n i am brahman of the nature of chit\n i am of the nature of sachchidananda\n this great science of shankara should never be explained to any ordinary person to an atheist or to a faithless ill behaved or evil minded person\n it should be after due examination given to the high souled ones whose minds are purified with devotion to their gurus\n it should be taught for a year and a half\n leaving off thoroughly and entirely the practice recommended by the other upanishads one should study the tejobindu upanishad always with delight\n by once studying it he becomes one with brahman\n thus ends the sixth chapter\n om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the tejobindu upanishad as contained in the krishna yajur veda",
    "Nadabindu": "om may my speech be based on i\n accord with the mind may my mind be based on speech\n o self effulgent one reveal thyself to me\n may you both speech and mind be the carriers of the veda to me\n may not all that i have heard depart from me\n i shall join together i\n obliterate the difference of day and night through this study\n i shall utter what is verbally true i shall utter what is mentally true\n may that brahman protect me may that protect the speaker i\n the teacher may that protect me may that protect the speaker may that protect the speaker\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me \n the syllable a is considered to be its the bird om s right wing upanishad its left m its tail and the ardha matra half metre is said to be its head\n the rajasic and tamasic qualities its feet upwards to the loins sattva its main body dharma is considered to be its right eye and adharma its left\n the bhur loka is situated in its feet the bhuvar loka in its knees the suvar loka in its loins and the mahar loka in its navel\n in its heart is situate the janoloka tapoloka in its throat and the satya loka in the centre of the forehead between the eyebrows\n then the matra or mantra beyond the sahasrara yousand rayed is explained viz\n an adept in yoga who bestrides the hamsa bird thus viz\n contemplates on om is not affected by karmic influences or by tens of crores of sins\n the first matra has agni as its devata presiding deity the second vayu as its devata the next matra is resplendent like the sphere of the sun and the last ardha matra the wise know as belonging to varuna the presiding deity of water \n each of these matras has indeed three kalas parts \n this is called omkara\n know it by means of the dharanas viz\n concentration on each of the twelve kalas or the variations of the matras produced by the difference of svaras or intonation \n the first matra is called ghoshini the second vidyunmali or vidyunmatra the third patangini the fourth vayuvegini the fifth namadheya the sixth aindri the seventh vaishnavi the eighth sankari the ninth mahati the tenth dhriti dhruva the eleventh nari mauni and the twelfth brahmi\n if a person happens to die in the first matra while contemplating on it he is born again as a great emperor in bharatavarsha\n if in the second matra he becomes an illustrious yaksha if in the third matra a vidyadhara if in the fourth a gandharva these three being the celestial hosts \n if he happens to die in the fifth viz\n ardha matra he lives in the world of the moon with the rank of a deva greatly glorified there\n if in the sixth he merges into indra if in the seventh he reaches the seat of vishnu if in the eighth rudra the lord of all creatures\n if in the ninth in mahar loka if in the tenth in janoloka dhruva loka if in the eleventh tapoloka and if in the twelfth he attains the eternal state of brahma\n that which is beyond these viz\n para brahman which is beyond the above matras the pure the all pervading beyond kalas the ever resplendent and the source of all jyoit is light should be known\n when the mind goes beyond the organs and the gunas and is absorbed having no separate existence and no mental action then the guru should instruct him as to his further course of development \n that person always engaged in its contemplation and always absorbed in it should gradually leave off his body or family following the course of yoga and avoiding all intercourse with society\n then he being freed from the bonds of karma and the existence as a jiva and being pure enjoys the supreme bliss by his attaining of the state of brahma\n o intelligent man spend your life always in the knowing of the supreme bliss enjoying the whole of your prarabdha that portion of past karma now being enjoyed wiyout making any complaint of it \n even after atma jnana knowledge of atman or self has awakened in one prarabdha does not leave him but he does not feel prarabdha after the dawning of tattva jnana knowledge of tattva or truth because the body and other things are asat unreal like the things seen in a dream to one on awaking from it\n that portion of the karma which is done in former births and called prarabdha does not at all affect the person tattva jnani as there is no rebirth to him\n as the body that exists in the dreaming state is untrue so is this body\n where then is rebirth to a thing that is illusory how can a thing have any existence when there is no birth to it as the clay is the material cause of the pot so one learns from vedanta that ajnana is the material cause of the universe and when ajnana ceases to exist where then is the cosmos as a person through illusion mistakes a rope for a serpent so the fool not knowing satya the eternal truth sees the world to be true \n when he knows it to be a piece of rope the illusory idea of a serpent vanishes\n so when he knows the eternal substratum of everything and all the universe becomes therefore void to him where then is prarabdha to him the body being a part of the world therefore the word prarabdha is accepted to enlighten the ignorant only \n then as prarabdha has in course of time worn out he who is the sound resulting from the union of pranava with brahman who is the absolute effulgence itself and who is the bestower of all good shines himself like the sun at the dispersion of the clouds\n the yogin being in the siddhasana posture and pracit ising the vaishnavi mudra should always hear the internal sound through the right ear\n the sound which he thus pracit ises makes him deaf to all external sounds\n having overcome all obstacles he enters the turya state within fifteen days\n in the beginning of his practice he hears many loud sounds\n they gradually increase in pitch and are heard more and more subtly\n at first the sounds are like those proceeding from the ocean clouds kettle drum and cataracts in the middle stage those proceeding from mardala a musical instrument bell and horn\n at the last stage those proceeding from tinkling bells flute vina a musical instrument and bees\n thus he hears many such sounds more and more subtle\n when he comes to that stage when the sound of the great kettle drum is being heard he should try to distinguish only sounds more and more subtle\n he may change his concentration from the gross sound to the subtle or from the subtle to the gross but he should not allow his mind to be diverted from them towards others\n the mind having at first concentrated itself on any one sound fixes firmly to that and is absorbed in it\n it the mind becoming insensible to the external impressions becomes one with the sound as milk with water and then becomes rapidly absorbed in chidakasa the akasa where chit prevails \n being indifferent towards all objects the yogin having controlled his passions should by continual practice concentrate his attention upon the sound which destroys the mind\n having abandoned all youghts and being freed from all actions he should always concentrate his attention on the sound and then his chitta becomes absorbed in it\n just as the bee drinking the honey alone does not care for the odour so the chitta which is always absorbed in sound does not long for sensual objects as it is bound by the sweet smell of nada and has abandoned its flitting nature\n the serpent chitta through listening to the nada is entirely absorbed in it and becoming unconscious of everything concentrates itself on the sound\n the sound serves the purpose of a sharp goad to control the maddened elephant chitta which roves in the pleasure garden of the sensual objects\n it serves the purpose of a snare for binding the deer chitta\n it also serves the purpose of a shore to the ocean waves of chitta\n the sound proceeding from pranava which is brahman is of the nature of effulgence the mind becomes absorbed in it that is the supreme seat of vishnu\n the sound exists till there is the akasic conception akasa sankalpa \n beyond this is the asabda soundless para brahman which is paramatman\n the mind exists so long as there is sound but with its sound s cessation there is the state called unmani of manas viz\n the state of being above the mind \n this sound is absorbed in the akshara indestructible and the soundless state is the supreme seat\n the mind which along with prana vayu has its karmic affinities destroyed by the constant concentration upon nada is absorbed in the unstained one\n there is no doubt of it\n many myriads of nadas and many more of bindus all become absorbed in the brahmapranava sound\n being freed from all states and all youghts whatever the yogin remains like one dead\n he is a mukta\n there is no doubt about this\n after that he does not at any time hear the sounds of conch or dundubhi large kettle drum \n the body in the state of unmani is certainly like a log and does not feel heat or cold joy or sorrow\n the yogin s chitta having given up fame or disgrace is in samadhi above the three states\n being freed from the waking and the sleeping states he attains to his true state\n when the spiritual sight becomes fixed wiyout any object to be seen when the vayu prana becomes still wiyout any effort and when the chitta becomes firm wiyout any support he becomes of the form of the internal sound of brahma pranava\n such is the upanishad\n om may my speech be based on i\n accord with the mind may my mind be based on speech\n o self effulgent one reveal thyself to me\n may you both speech and mind be the carriers of the veda to me\n may not all that i have heard depart from me\n i shall join together i\n obliterate the difference of day and night through this study\n i shall utter what is verbally true i shall utter what is mentally true\n may that brahman protect me may that protect the speaker i\n the teacher may that protect me may that protect the speaker may that protect the speaker\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the nadabindu upanishad as contained in the rig veda",
    "Dhyanabindu": "om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me \n even if sin should accumulate to a mountain extending over many yojanas distance it is destroyed by dhyana yoga\n at no time has been found a destroyer of sins like this\n bijakshara seed letter is the supreme bindu\n nada spiritual sound is above it\n when that nada ceases along with letter then the nada less is supreme state\n the yogin who considers as the highest that which is above nada which is anahata has all his doubts destroyed\n if the point of a hair be divided into one hundred yousand parts this nada is one half of that still further divided and when even this is absorbed the yogin attains to the stainless brahman\n one who is of a firm mind and wiyout the delusion of sensual pleasures and ever resting in brahman should see like the string in a rosary of beads all creatures as existing in atman like odour in flowers ghee in milk oil in gingelly seeds and gold in quartz\n again just as the oil depends for its manifestation upon gingelly seeds and odour upon flowers so does the purusha depend for its existence upon the body both external and internal\n the tree is with parts and its shadow is wiyout parts but with and wiyout parts atman exists everywhere\n the one akshara letter om should be contemplated upon as brahman by all who aspire for emancipation\n prithvi agni rig veda bhuh and brahma all these are absorbed when akara a the first amsa part of pranava om becomes absorbed\n antariksha yajur veda vayu bhuvah and vishnu the janardana all these are absorbed when ukara u the second amsa of pranava becomes absorbed\n dyur sun sama veda suvah and maheshvara all these are absorbed when makara m the third amsa of pranava becomes absorbed\n akara is of pita yellow colour and is said to be of rajo guna ukara is of white colour and of sattva guna makara is of dark colour and of tamo guna\n he who does not know omkara as having eight angas parts four padas feet three sthanas seats and five devatas presiding deities is not a brahmana\n pranava is the bow\n atman is the arrow and brahman is said to be the aim\n one should aim at it with great care and then he like the arrow becomes one with it\n when that highest is cognised all karmas return from him viz\n do not affect him \n the vedas have omkara as their cause\n the swaras sounds have omkara as their cause\n the three worlds with all the locomotive and the fixed ones in them have omkara as their cause\n the short accent of om burns all sins the long one is decayless and the bestower of prosperity\n united with ardha matra half metre of om the pranava becomes the bestower of salvation\n that man is the knower of the vedas who knows that the end viz\n ardha matra of pranava should be worshipped or recited as uninterrupted as the flow of oil and resounding as long as the sound of a bell\n one should contemplate upon omkara as ishvara resembling an unshaken light as of the size of a thumb and as motionless in the middle of the pericarp of the lotus of the heart\n taking in vayu through the left nostril and filling the stomach with it one should contemplate upon omkara as being in the middle of the body and as surrounded by circling flames\n brahma is said to be inspiration vishnu is said to be cessation of breath and rudra is said to be expiration\n these are the devatas of pranayama\n having made atman as the lower arani sacrificial wood and pranava as the upper arani one should see the god in secret through the practice of churning which is dhyana\n one should pracit ise restraint of breath as much as it lies in his power along with the uttering of omkara sound until it ceases completely\n those who look upon om as of the form of hamsa staying in all shining like crores of suns being alone staying in gamagama ever going and coming and being devoid of motion at last such persons are freed from sin\n that manas which is the author of the actions viz\n creation preservation and destruction of the three worlds is then absorbed in the supreme one \n that is the highest state of vishnu\n the lotus of the heart has eight petals and thirty two filaments\n the sun is in its midst the moon is in the middle of the sun\n agni is in the middle of the moon the prabha spiritual light is in the middle of agni\n pitha seat or centre is in the midst of prabha being set in diverse gems\n one should meditate upon the stainless lord vasudeva as being seated upon the centre of pitha as having srivatsa black mark and kaustubha garland of gems on his chest and as adorned with gems and pearls resembling pure crystal in lustre and as resembling crores of moons in brightness\n he should meditate upon maha vishnu as above or in the following manner\n that is he should meditate with inspiration of breath upon maha vishnu as resembling the atasi flower and as staying in the seat of navel with four hands then with restraint of breath he should meditate in the heart upon brahma the grandfather as being on the lotus with the gaura pale red colour of gems and having four faces then through expiration he should meditate upon the three eyed shiva between the two eyebrows shining like the pure crystal being stainless destroying all sins being in that which is like the lotus facing down with its flower or face below and the stalk above or like the flower of a plantain tree being of the form of all vedas containing one hundred petals and one hundred leaves and having the pericarp full expanded\n there he should meditate upon the sun the moon and the agni one above another\n passing above through the lotus which has the brightness of the sun moon and agni and taking its hrim bija letter one leads his atman firmly\n he is the knower of vedas who knows the three seats the three matras the three brahmas the three aksharas letters and the three matras associated with the ardha matra\n he who knows that which is above bindu nada and kala as uninterrupted as the flow of oil and resounding as long as the sound of a bell that man is a knower of the vedas\n just as a man would draw up with his mouth the water through the pores of the lotus stalk so the yogin treading the path of yoga should draw up the breath\n having made the lotus sheath of the form of ardha matra one should draw up the breath through the stalk of the nadis susumna ida and pingala and absorb it in the middle of the eyebrows\n he should know that the middle of the eyebrows in the forehead which is also the root of the nose is the seat of nectar\n that is the great place of brahman\n postures restraint of breath subjugation of the senses dharana dhyana and samadhi are the six parts of yoga\n there are as many postures as there are living creatures and maheshvara the great lord knows their distinguishing features\n siddha bhadra simha and padma are the four chief postures\n muladhara is the first chakra\n svadhisthana is the second\n between these two is said to be the seat of yoni perineum having the form of kama god of love \n in the adhara of the anus there is the lotus of four petals\n in its midst is said to be the yoni called kama and worshipped by the siddhas\n in the midst of the yoni is the linga facing the west and split at its head like the gem\n he who knows this is a knower of the vedas\n a four sided figure is situated above agni and below the genital organ of the form of molten gold and shining like streaks of lightning\n prana is with its sva own sound having svadhisthana as its adhisthana seat or since sva or prana arises from it \n the chakra svadhisthana is spoken of as the genital organ itself\n the chakra in the sphere of the navel is called manipuraka since the body is pierced through by vayu like manis gems by string\n the jiva ego urged to actions by its past virtuous and sinful karmas whirls about in this great chakra of twelve spokes so long as it does not grasp the truth\n above the genital organ and below the navel is kanda of the shape of a bird s egg\n there arise from it nadis seventy two yousand in number\n of these seventy two are generally known\n of these the chief ones are ten and carry the pranas\n ida pingala susumna gandhari hastijihva pusha yasasvini alambusa kuhuh and sankhini are said to be the ten\n this chakra of the nadis should ever be known by the yogins\n the three nadis ida pingala and susumna are said to carry prana always and have as their devatas moon sun and agni\n ida is on the left side and pingala on the right side while the susumna is in the middle\n these three are known to be the paths of prana\n prana apana samana udana and vyana naga kurma krikara devadatta and dhananjaya of these the first five are called pranas etc\n and last five naga etc\n are called vayus or sub pranas \n all these are situated or run along the one yousand nadis being in the form of or producing life\n jiva which is under the influence of prana and apana goes up and down\n jiva on account of its ever moving by the left and right paths is not visible\n just as a ball struck down on the earth with the bat of the hand springs up so jiva ever tossed by prana and apana is never at rest\n he is knower of yoga who knows that prana always draws itself from apana and apana draws itself from prana like a bird drawing itself from and yet not freeing itself from the string to which it is tied \n the jiva comes out with the letter ha and gets in again with the letter sa \n thus jiva always utters the mantra hamsa hamsa \n the jiva always utters the mantra twenty one yousand and six hundred times in one day and night\n this is called ajapa gayatri and is ever the bestower of nirvana to the yogins\n through its very yought man is freed from sins\n neither in the past nor in the future is there a science equal to this a japa equal to this or a meritorious action equal to this\n kundalini sakti sleeps shutting with her mouth that door which leads to the decayless brahma hole\n being aroused by the contact of agni with manas and prana she takes the form of a needle and pierces up through susumna\n the yogin should open with great effort this door which is shut\n then he will pierce the door to salvation by means of kundalini\n folding firmly the fingers of the hands assuming firmly the padma posture placing the chin firmly on the breast and fixing the mind in dhyana one should frequently raise up the apana fill up with air and then leave the prana\n then the wise man gets matchless wisdom through this sakti\n that yogin who assuming padma posture worships i\n controls vayu at the door of the nadis and then performs restraint of breath is released wiyout doubt\n rubbing off the limbs the sweat arising from fatigue abandoning all acid bitter and salit ish food taking delight in the drinking of milk and rasa pracit ising celibacy being moderate in eating and ever bent on yoga the yogin becomes a siddha in little more than a year\n no inquiry need be made concerning the result\n kundalini sakti when it is up in the throat makes the yogi get siddhi\n the union of prana and apana has the extinction of urine and faeces\n one becomes young even when old through performing mula bandha always\n pressing the yoni by means of the heels and contracting the anus and drawing up the apana this is called mulabandha\n uddiyana bandha is so called because it is like a great bird that flies up always wiyout rest\n one should bring the western part of the stomach above the navel\n this uddiyana bandha is a lion to the elephant of death since it binds the water or nectar of the akasa which arises in the head and flows down\n the jalandhara bandha is the destroyer of all the pains of the throat\n when this jalandhara bandha which is destroyer of the pains of the throat is performed then nectar does not fall on agni nor does the vayu move\n when the tongue enters backwards into the hole of the skull then there is the mudra of vision latent in the eyebrow called khechari\n he who knows the mudra khechari has not disease death sleep hunger thirst or swoon\n he who pracit ises this mudra is not affected by illness or karma nor is he bound by the limitations of time\n since chitta moves in the kha akasa and since the tongue has entered in the mudra kha viz\n the hole in the mouth \n therefore the mudra is called khechari and worshipped by the siddhas\n he whose hole or passage above the uvula is closed with the tongue backwards by means of khechari mudra never loses his virility even when embraced by a lovely woman\n where is the fear of death so long as the bindu virility stays in the body\n bindu does not go out of the body so long as the khechari mudra is pracit ised\n even when bindu comes down to the sphere of the perineum it goes up being prevented and forced up by violent effort through yoni mudra\n this bindu is twofold white and red\n the white one is called sukla and the red one is said to contain much rajas\n the rajas which stays in yoni is like the colour of a coral\n the bindu stays in the seat of the genital organs\n the union of these two is very rare\n bindu is shiva and rajas is sakti\n bindu is the moon and rajas is the sun\n through the union of these two is attained the highest body when rajas is roused up by agitating the sakti through vayu which unites with the sun thence is produced the divine form\n sukla being united with the moon and rajas with the sun he is a knower of yoga who knows the proper mixture of these two\n the cleansing of the accumulated refuse the unification of the sun and the moon and the complete drying of the rasas essences this is called maha mudra\n placing the chin on the breast pressing the anus by means of the left heel and seizing the toe of the extended right leg by the two hands one should fill his belly with air and should slowly exhale\n this is called maha mudra the destroyer of the sins of men\n now i shall give a description of atman\n in the seat of the heart is a lotus of eight petals\n in its centre is jivatma of the form of jyoit is and atomic in size moving in a circular line\n in it is located everything\n it does all these actions attributing everything to its own power thinking i do i enjoy i am happy i am miserable i am blind i am lame i am deaf i am mute i am lean i am stout etc\n when it rests on the eastern petal which is of sveta white colour then it has a mind or is inclined to dharma with bhakti devotion \n when it rests on the south eastern petal which is of rakta blood colour then it is inclined to sleep and laziness\n when it rests on the southern petal which is of krishna black colour then it is inclined to hate and anger\n when it rests on the south western petal which is of nila blue colour then it gets desire for sinful or harmful actions\n when it rests on the western petal which is of crystal colour then it is inclined to flirt and amuse\n when it rests on the north western petal which is of ruby colour then it has a mind to walk rove and have vairagya or be indifferent \n when it rests on the northern petal which is pita yellow colour then it is inclined to be happy and to be loving\n when it rests on the north eastern petal which is of vaidurya lapis lazuli colour then it is inclined to amassing money charity and passion\n when it stays in the inter space between any two petals then it gets the wrath arising from diseases generated through the disturbance of the equilibrium of vayu bile and phlegm in the body \n when it stays in the middle then it knows everything sings dances speaks and is blissful\n when the eye is pained after a day s work then in order to remove its pain it makes first a circular line and sinks in the middle\n the first line is of the colour of bandhuka flower bassia \n then is the state of sleep\n in the middle of the state of sleep is the state of dream\n in the middle of the state of dream it experiences the ideas of perception vedas inference possibility sacred words etc\n then there arises much fatigue\n in order to remove this fatigue it circles the second line and sinks in the middle\n the second is of the colour of the insect indragopa of red or white colour \n then comes the state of dreamless sleep\n during the dreamless sleep it has only the yought connected with parameshvara the highest lord alone\n this state is of the nature of eternal wisdom\n afterwards it attains the nature of the highest lord parameshvara \n then it makes a round of the third circle and sinks in the middle\n the third circle is of the colour of padmaraga ruby \n then comes the state of turya the fourth \n in turya there is only the connection of paramatman\n it attains the nature of eternal wisdom\n then one should gradually attain the quiescence of buddhi with self control\n placing the manas in atman one should think of nothing else\n then causing the union of prana and apana he concentrates his aim upon the whole universe being of the nature of atman\n then comes the state of turiyatita viz\n that state beyond the fourth \n then everything appears as bliss\n he is beyond the pairs of happiness and pains etc\n he stays here as long as he should wear his body\n then he attains the nature of paramatman and attains emancipation through this means\n this alone is the means of knowing atman\n when vayu breath which enters the great hole associated with a hall where four roads meet gets into the half of the well placed triangle then is achyuta the indestructible seen\n above the aforesaid triangle one should meditate on the five bija seed letters of the elements prithvi etc\n as also on the five pranas the colour of the bijas and their position\n the letter ya is the bija of prana and resembles the blue cloud\n the letter ra is the bija of agni is of apana and resembles the sun\n the letter la is the bija of prithvi is of vyana and resembles bandhuka flower\n the letter va is the bija of jiva or vayu is of udana and is of the colour of the conch\n the letter ha is the bija of akasa is of samana and is of the colour of crystal\n prana stays in the heart navel nose ear foot finger and other places travels through the seventy two yousand nadis stays in the twenty eight crores of hair pores and is yet the same everywhere\n it is that which is called jiva\n one should perform the three expiration etc\n with a firm will and great control and drawing in everything with the breath in slow degrees he should bind prana and apana in the cave of the lotus of the heart and utter pranava having contracted his throat and the genital organ\n from the muladhara to the head is the susumna resembling the shining thread of the lotus\n the nada is located in the vinadanda spinal column that sound from its middle resembles that of the conch etc\n when it goes to the hole of akasa it resembles that of the peacock\n in the middle of the cave of the skull between the four doors shines atman like the sun in the sky\n between the two bows in the brahma hole one should see purusha with sakti as his own atman\n then his manas is absorbed there\n that man attains kaivalya who understands the gems moonlight nada bindu and the seat of maheshvara the great lord \n thus is the upanishad\n om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work

of yogins who are freed from all sins through the hearing and the studying of it\n the supreme purusha called vishnu who is the great yogin the great being and the great tapasvin is seen as a lamp in the path of the truth\n the grandfather brahma having saluted the lord of the universe vishnu and having paid him due respects asked him thus pray explain to us the truth of yoga which includes in it the eight subservients\n to which hrisikesha the lord of the senses or vishnu replied thus listen\n i shall explain its truth\n all souls are immersed in happiness and sorrow through the snare of maya\n kaivalya the supreme seat is the path which gives them emancipation which rends asunder the snare of maya which is the destroyer of birth old age and disease and which enables one to overcome death\n there are no other paths to salvation\n those who go round the net of shastras are deluded by that knowledge\n it is impossible even for the devas to describe that indescribable state\n how can that which is selfshining be illuminated by the shastras \n that only which is wiyout parts and stains and which is quiescent beyond all and free from decay becomes the jiva self on account of the results of past virtues and sins\n how did that which is the seat of paramatman is eternal and above the state of all existing things and is of the form of wisdom and wiyout stains attain the state of jiva \n a bubble arose in it as in water and in this bubble arose ahankara\n to it arose a ball of body made of the five elements and bound by dhatus\n know that to be jiva which is associated with happiness and misery and hence is the term jiva applied to paramatman which is pure\n that jiva is considered to be the kevala alone which is freed from the stains of passion anger fear delusion greed pride lust birth death miserliness swoon giddiness hunger thirst ambition shame fright heart burning grief and gladness\n so i shall tell you the means of destroying these sins\n how could jnana capable of giving moksha arise certainly wiyout yoga \n and even yoga becomes powerless in securing moksha when it is devoid of jnana\n so the aspirant after emancipation should pracit ise firmly both yoga and jnana\n the cycle of births and deaths comes only through jnana and perishes only through jnana\n jnana alone was originally\n it should be known as the only means of salvation \n that is jnana through which one cognises in himself the real nature of kaivalya as the supreme seat the stainless the partless and of the nature of sachchidananda wiyout birth existence and death and wiyout motion and jnana\n now i shall proceed to describe yoga to you yoga is divided into many kinds on account of its actions viz\n mantra yoga laya yoga hatha yoga and raja yoga\n there are four states common to all these viz\n arambha ghata parichaya and nishpatti\n o brahma i shall describe these to you\n one should pracit ise the mantra along with its matrikas proper intonations of the sounds and others for a period of twelve years \n then he gradually obtains wisdom along with the siddhis such as anima etc\n persons of weak intellect who are the least qualified for yoga pracit ise this\n the second laya yoga tends towards the absorption of the chitta and is described in myriads of ways one of which is one should contemplate upon the lord who is wiyout parts even while walking sitting sleeping or eating\n this is called laya yoga\n now hear the description of hatha yoga\n this yoga is said to possess the following eight subservients yama forbearance niyama religious observance asana posture pranayama suppression of breath pratyahara subjugation of the senses dharana concentration dhyana the contemplation on hari in the middle of the eyebrows and samadhi that is the state of equality\n maha mudra maha bandha and khechari jalandhara uddiyana and mula bandha uttering wiyout intermission pranava om for a long time and hearing the exposition of the supreme truths vajroli amaroli and sahajoli which form a triad all these separately i shall give a true description of\n o four faced one brahma among the duties of yama moderate eating and not others forms the principal factor and non injury is most important in niyama\n the chief postures are four viz\n siddha padma simha and bhadra\n during the early stages of practice the following obstacles take place o four faced one viz\n laziness idle talk association with bad characters acquisition of mantras etc\n playing with metals alchemy and woman etc\n a wise man having found out these should abandon them by the force of his virtues\n then assuming padma posture he should pracit ise pranayama\n he should erect a beautiful monastery with a very small opening and with no crevices\n it should be well pasted with cow dung or with white cement\n it should be carefully freed from bugs mosquitoes and lice\n it should be swept well every day with a broom\n it should be perfumed with good odours and fragrant resins should burn in it\n having taken his seat neither too high nor too low on a cloth deer skin and kusa grass spread one over the other the wise man should assume the padma posture and keeping his body erect and his hands folded in respect should salute his tutelary deity\n then closing the right nostril with his right thumb he should gradually draw in the air through the left nostril\n having restrained it as long as possible he should again expel it through the right nostril slowly and not very fast\n then filling the stomach through the right nostril he should retain it as long as he can and then expel it through the left nostril\n drawing the air through that nostril by which he expels he should continue this in uninterrupted succession\n the time taken in making a round of the knee with the palm of the hand neither very slowly nor vary rapidly and snapping the fingers once is called a matra\n drawing the air through the left nostril for about sixteen matras and having retained it within for about sixty four matras one should expel it again through the right nostril for about thirty two matras\n again fill the right nostril as before and continue the rest \n pracit ise cessation of breath four times daily viz\n at sunrise noon sunset and midnight till eighty times are reached \n by a continual practice for about three months the purification of the nadis takes place\n when the nadis have become purified certain external signs appear on the body of the yogin\n i shall proceed to describe them\n they are lightness of the body brilliancy of complexion increase of the gastric fire leanness of the body and along with these absence of restlessness in the body\n the proficient in yoga should abandon the food detrimental to the practice of yoga\n he should give up salt mustard things sour hot pungent or bitter vegetables asafoetida etc\n worship of fire women walking bathing at sunrise emaciation of the body by fasts etc\n during the early stages of practice food of milk and ghee is ordained also food consisting of wheat green pulse and red rice are said to favour the progress\n then he will be able to retain his breath as long as he likes\n by thus retaining the breath as long as he likes kevala kumbhaka cessation of breath wiyout inspiration and expiration is attained\n when kevala kumbhaka is attained by one and thus expiration and inspiration are dispensed with there is nothing unattainable in the three worlds to him\n in the commencement of his practice sweat is given out he should wipe it off\n even after that owing to the retaining of the breath the person pracit ising it gets phlegm\n then by an increased practice of dharana sweat arises\n as a frog moves by leaps so the yogin sitting in the padma posture moves on the earth\n with a further increased practice he is able to rise from the ground\n he while seated in padma posture levitates\n there arises to him the power to perform extraordinary feats\n he does or should not disclose to others his feats of great powers in the path \n any pain small or great does not affect the yogin\n then excretions and sleep are diminished tears rheum in the eye salivary flow sweat and bad smell in the mouth do not arise in him\n with a still further practice he acquires great strength by which he attains bhuchara siddhi which enables him to bring under his control all the creatures that tread this earth tigers sarabhas an animal with eight legs elephants with bulls or lions die on being struck by the palm of the yogin\n he becomes as beautiful as the god of love himself\n all females being taken up with the beauty of his person will desire to have intercourse with him\n if he so keeps connection his virility will be lost so abandoning all copulation with women he should continue his practice with great assiduity\n by the preservation of the semen a good odour pervades the body of the yogin\n then sitting in a secluded place he should repeat pranava om with three pluta matras or prolonged intonation for the destruction of his former sins\n the mantra pranava om destroys all obstacles and all sins\n by pracit ising thus he attains the arambha beginning or first state\n then follows the ghata second state one which is acquired by constantly pracit ising suppression of breath\n when a perfect union takes place between prana and apana manas and buddhi or jivatma and paramatman wiyout opposition it is called the ghata state\n i shall describe its signs\n he may now pracit ise only for about one fourth of the period prescribed for practice before\n by day and evening let him pracit ise only for a yama hours \n let him pracit ise kevala kumbhaka once a day\n drawing away completely the organs from the objects of sense during cessation of breath is called pratyahara\n whatever he sees with his eyes let him consider as atman\n whatever he hears with his ears let him consider as atman\n whatever he smells with his nose let him consider as atman\n whatever he tastes with his tongue let him consider as atman\n whatever the yogin touches with his skin let him consider as atman\n the yogin should thus unwearied gratify his organs of sense for a period of one yama every day with great effort\n then various wonderful powers are attained by the yogin such as clairvoyance clair audience ability to transport himself to great distances within a moment great power of speech ability to take any form ability to become invisible and the transmutation of iron into gold when the former is smeared over with his excretion\n that yogin who is constantly pracit ising yoga attains the power to levitate\n then should the wise yogin think that these powers are great obstacles to the attainment of yoga and so he should never take delight in them\n the king of yogins should not exercise his powers before any person whatsoever\n he should live in the world as a fool an idiot or a deaf man in order to keep his powers concealed\n his disciples would wiyout doubt request him to show his powers for the gratification of their own desires\n one who is actively engaged in one s duties forgets to pracit ise yoga so he should pracit ise day and night yoga wiyout forgetting the words of the guru\n thus passes the ghata state to one who is constantly engaged in yoga practice\n to one nothing is gained by useless company since thereby he does not pracit ise yoga\n so one should with great effort pracit ise yoga\n then by this constant practice is gained the parichaya state the third state \n vayu or breath through arduous practice pierces along with agni the kundalini through yought and enters the susumna uninterrupted\n when one s chitta enters susumna along with prana it reaches the high seat of the head probably along with prana\n there are the five elements prithvi apas agni vayu and akasa\n to the body of the five elements there is the fivefold dharana\n from the feet to the knees is said to be the region of prithvi is four sided in shape is yellow in colour and has the varna or letter la \n carrying the breath with the letter la along the region of earth viz\n from the foot to the knees and contemplating upon brahma with four faces and four mouths and of a golden colour one should perform dharana there for a period of two hours\n he then attains mastery over the earth\n death does not trouble him since he has obtained mastery over the earth element\n the region of apas is said to extend from the knees to the anus\n apas is semi lunar in shape and white in colour and has va for its bija seed letter\n carrying up the breath with the letter va along the regions of apas he should contemplate on the god narayana having four arms and a crowned head as being of the colour of pure crystal as dressed in orange clothes and as decayless and pracit ising dharana there for a period of two hours he is freed from all sins\n then there is no fear for him from water and he does not meet his death in water\n from the anus to the heart is said to be the region of agni\n agni is triangular in shape of red colour and has the letter ra for its bija seed\n raising the breath made resplendent through the letter ra along the region of fire he should contemplate on rudra who has three eyes who grants all wishes who is of the colour of the midday sun who is daubed all over with holy ashes and who is of a pleased countenance\n pracit ising dharana there for a period of two hours he is not burnt by fire even yough his body enters the fire pit\n from the heart to the middle of the eyebrows is said to the region of vayu\n vayu is hexangular in shape black in colour and shines with the letter ya \n carrying the breath along the region of vayu he should contemplate on ishvara the omniscient as possessing faces on all sides and pracit ising dharana there for two hours he enters vayu and then akasa\n the yogin does not meet his death through the fear of vayu\n from the centre of the eyebrows to the top of the head is said to be the region of akasa is circular in the shape smoky in colour and shining with letter ha \n raising the breath along the region of akasa he should contemplate on sadashiva in the following manner as producing happiness as of the shape of bindu as the great deva as having the shape of akasa as shining like pure crystal as wearing the rising crescent of moon on his head as having five faces ten hands and three eyes as being of a pleased countenance as armed with all weapons as adorned with all ornaments as having uma the goddess in one half of his body as ready to grant favours and as the cause of all the causes\n by pracit ising dharana in the region of akasa he obtains certainly the power of levitating in the akasa ether \n wherever he stays he enjoys supreme bliss\n the proficient in yoga should pracit ise these five dharanas\n then his body becomes strong and he does not know death\n that great minded man does not die even during the deluge of brahma\n then he should pracit ise dharana for a period of six ghatikas hours minutes \n restraining the breath in the region of akasa and contemplating on the deity who grants his wishes this is said to be saguna dhyana capable of giving the siddhis anima etc\n one who is engaged in nirguna dhyana attains the stage of samadhi\n within twelve days at least he attains the stage of samadhi\n restraining his breath the wise one becomes an emancipated person\n samadhi is that state in which the jivatman lower self and the paramatman higher self are differenceless or of equal state \n if he desires to lay aside his body he can do so\n he will become absorbed in parabrahmaan and does not require utkranti going out or up \n but if he does not so desire and if his body is dear to him he lives in all the worlds possessing the siddhis of anima etc\n sometimes he becomes a deva and lives honoured in svarga or he becomes a man or an yaksha through his will\n he can also take the form of a lion tiger elephant or horse through his own will\n the yogin becoming the great lord can live as long as he likes\n there is difference only in the modes of procedure but the result is the same\n place the left heel pressed on the anus stretch the right leg and hold it firmly with both hands\n place the head on the breast and inhale the air slowly\n restrain the breath as long as you can and then slowly breathe out\n after pracit ising it with the left foot pracit ise it with the right\n place the foot that was stretched before on the thigh\n this is maha bandha and should be pracit ised on both sides\n the yogin sitting in maha bandha and having inhaled the air with intent mind should stop the course of vayu inside by means of the throat mudra and occupying the two sides of the throat with speed\n this is called mahavedha and is frequently pracit ised by the siddhas\n with the tongue thrust into the interior cavity of the head or throat and with the eyes intent on the spot between the eyebrows this is called khechari mudra\n contracting the muscles of the neck and placing the head with a firm will on the breast this is called the jalandhara bandha and is a lion to the elephant of death\n that bandha by which prana flies through susumna is called uddiyana bandha by the yogins\n pressing the heal firmly against the anus contracting the anus and drawing up the apana this is said to be yoni bandha\n through mula bandha prana and apana as well as nada and bindu are united and gives success in yoga there is no doubt about this\n the one pracit ising in a reversed manner or on both sides which destroys all diseases the gastric fire is increased\n therefore a practitioner should collect a large quantity of provisions for if he takes a small quantity of food the fire within will consume his body in a moment\n on the first day he should stand on his head with the feet raised up for a moment\n he should increase this period gradually every day\n wrinkles and greyness of hair will disappear within three months\n he who pracit ises only for a period of a yama twenty four minutes every day conquers time\n he who pracit ises vajroli becomes a yogin and the repository of all siddhis\n if the yoga siddhis are ever to be attained he only has them within his reach\n he knows the past and the future and certainly moves in the air\n he who drinks of the nectar thus is rendered immortal day by day\n he should daily pracit ise vajroli\n then it is called amaroli\n then he obtains the raja yoga and certainly he does not meet with obstacles\n when a yogin fulfils his action by raja yoga then he certainly obtains discrimination and indifference to objects\n vishnu the great yogin the grand one of great austerities and the most excellent purusha is seen as a lamp in the path of truth\n that breast from which one suckled before in his previous birth he now presses in love and obtains pleasure\n he enjoys the same genital organ from which he was born before\n she who was once his mother will now be wife and she who is now wife is or will be verily mother\n he who is now father will be again son and he who is now son will be again father\n thus are the egos of this world wandering in the womb of birth and death like a bucket in the wheel of a well and enjoying the worlds\n there are the three worlds three vedas three sandhyas morning noon and evening three svaras sounds three agnis and gunas and all these are placed in the three letters om \n he who understands that which is indestructible and is the meaning of the three om by him are all these worlds strung\n this is the truth the supreme seat\n as the smell in the flower as the ghee in the milk as the oil in the gingelly seed and as the gold in the quartz so is the lotus situated in the heart\n its face is downwards and its stem upwards\n its bindu is downwards and in its centre is situated manas\n by the letter a the lotus becomes expanded by the letter u it becomes split or opened \n by the letter m it obtains nada and the ardha matra half metre is silence\n the person engaged in yoga obtains the supreme seat which is like a pure crystal which is wiyout parts and which destroys all sins\n as a tortoise draws its hands and head within itself so drawing in air thus and expelling it through the nine holes of the body he breathes upwards and forwards\n like a lamp in an air tight jar which is motionless so that which is seen motionless through the process of yoga in the heart and which is free from turmoil after having been drawn from the nine holes is said to be atman alone\n

    "Naradaparivrajaka": "om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me now once narada a jewel among ascetics taking his usual rounds over all the three worlds sanctifying all the more new sacred places and holy places of pilgrimage by his observation himself attaining purity of mind remaining free from enmity tranquil self controlled getting despondent from every quarter seeing people s misery closely investigating into his own self seeing the holy place the naimisha sacred forest noted for its joy of self imposed religious observances and crowded with saintly personages he alighted there from his aerial journey fascinating groups of men animals horse faced demigods gods kimnara demigods and nymphs with his songs on the exploits of lord vishnu called sthavara and jangama which specially induce devotion to the lord set in musical notes sa ri ga ma pa dha and ni which arouse dispassion to worldly attachments and which are averse to the ways of the world\n on his approach saunaka and other great sages who had arrived there to participate in a sacrifice lasting twelve years rich in vedic lore all wise in sacerdotal functions well addicted to stable penance and endowed with wisdom and dispassion rose to greet him and paying homage seated him in a place of honour after offering him a befitting welcome\n then yough they were already well instructed in matters spiritual yet for the benefit of the world they said to narada revered sir son of the god brahma what is the means of liberation from worldly bondage please tell us\n thus requested that sage narada said to them a twice born of good family invested with the sacred thread and initiated into vedic study having undergone the forty sacred rites beginning with consummation of marriage of his parents and ending with aptoryama sacrifice completing the course on all branches of learning as a disciplined celibate student for twelve years doing personal service to the preceptor all along the period of twenty five years as a householder another twenty five years in the stage of a forest dweller vanaprastha all the three stages in due order in the prescribed manner having studied well the duties of four kinds of brahmacharya six kinds of householders four kinds of vanaprastha having completed all the appropriate duties pertaining to them equipped with the four disciplines for the study of brahmavidya free from desire in yought word and deed as well as in latent desires vasanas and solicitations eshana devoid of enmity and is peaceful and self controlled when such an ascetic meditating on his self wiyout interruption in the highest stage of renunciation as paramahamsa gives up the body he becomes liberated from rebirth he becomes liberated\n thus ends the first upadesha of the upanishad\n then all sages saunaka and others requested the venerable narada revered sir expound to us the mode of renunciation \n observing them narada said it is but proper to know all about its nature from the mouth of the grandfather the god brahma \n after the completion of the sacrifice he went accompanied by them to the world of the god brahma satyaloka and made obeisance in the prescribed manner to him paramesthin and eulogised him\n bidden by him he seated himself along with them properly and said to the grandfather of all you are the preceptor you are the father you are omniscient knowing the secret of all lores\n hence be pleased to expound one secret lore of my choice\n barring you who is competent to speak on the secret lore dear to me it is to wit the stages in the order of mendicant monks\n requested thus by narada the god brahma seeing them all on all sides remained steady in deep meditation samadhi for a short time\n coming to the conclusion that they were in search of a remedy against the ills of worldly life and turning to narada the grandfather said my son i shall now clearly expound the secret which was formerly taught by the supreme being viratpurusha assuming the matchless form of the purusha sukta hymn and the secret doctrine of the upanishads\n may you listen to this due order of asceticism very secret with all your attention \n o narada one born in a good family being uninitiated at first getting initiated into vedic lore after being invested with sacred thread obedient to his mother and father approaches after the preliminary instructions by his father a good preceptor who maintains the noble tradition has faith in the vedic lore is born of a good family is well versed in the vedas has love for the shastras is virtuous and free from devious ways\n bowing to him and rendering personal service appropriate for the occasion he shall inform him of his heart s desire to study under him \n having undergone the course of study in all branches of learning for twelve years doing personal service all the while he shall marry an agreeable damsel woryour of his family with his preceptor s consent\n after this residence in the preceptor s house he leads with the approval of the teacher the life appropriate to a householder for twenty five years\n free from the evils of a bad brahmana getting a son with desire to perpetuate his family and completing twenty five years befitting the stage of a householder he shall lead the life of a lone forest dweller vanaprastha till another twenty five years are passed bathing thrice a day after touching with water the various parts of the body eating one meal a day at the fourth watch of day time i\n in the afternoon giving up journey to town and village as pracit ised in former days performing appropriate rituals wiyout using cultivated grains such as wheat and rice but using wild grains alone free from desire for enjoyments that are seen or heard of i\n pleasures in this world and the next being purified by the forty sacraments free of attachments to all things getting purity of mind having burnt away envy jealousy and egoit ism and being rich in the fourfold discipline such a person deserves to embrace the life of renunciation \n thus ends the second upadesha of the upanishad\n then narada asked the grandfather brahma lord what is renunciation sannyasa and who is entitled to renounce worldly life i shall first deal with the kind of person entitled to renunciation and thereafter the mode of renunciation\n listen attentively these the following persons do not deserve to renounce worldly life\n a eunuch one fallen from right conduct deformed person women the deaf a child the dumb the heretic an emperor a religious student a vaikhanasa anchorite and a haradvija kapalika a hired teacher a man wiyout prepuce and one who does not maintain the sacred fire even yough all these are possessed of dispassion\n even if they adopt the life of renunciation they have no right to receive instruction in the great vedic texts thou art that etc\n one who is already an ascetic has the right to become the highest kind of ascetic paramahamsa \n he who brings about protection from fear to others from him as he gets himself that protection from fear from others is declared in law books as a mendicant monk\n a eunuch deformed person the blind a boy one guilty of crime one fallen from right conduct one always at the gate of another seeking help the vaikhanasa anchorite and the haradvija an emperor a religious student a heretic one wiyout prepuce one who does not maintain the sacred fire one who has twice or thrice renounced worldly life previously and a hired teacher these persons do not deserve to embrace renunciation excepting the afflicted in emergency just before death \n how is renunciation at the time of dire affliction approved by the esteemed aryas the time just prior to the departure of the vital breath from the body is called the sorely afflicted time and not any other this occasion of emergency leads to the path of liberation by recourse to renunciation with the prescribed praisamantras \n even in renunciation by the sorely afflicted atura sannyasa a wise man shall renounce the world only in the prescribed manner by uttering the mantras laid down for it and having repeated the mantras\n even in the kind of renunciation adopted by the greatly afflicted there is nowhere any difference in the praisa mantras \n there is no mantra uttered wiyout a religious activity and a religious activity has an eye on a mantra\n an act wiyout a mantra is no religious act i\n it is different hence one shall not give up the mantra\n a religious act done wiyout mantra is like oblation offered in ashes\n renunciation by the sorely afflicted is declared to be by abridging the ritual prescribed therefor hence in atura sannyasa there is the mode of repeating mantras wiyout ritual o sage \n if an ahitagni householder gets disillusioned with the world while away in another province he shall complete the prapatya sacrifice in a reservoir of waters and then renounce worldly life\n a wise man shall renounce the world after completing the prerequisite recital of praisa mantras either mentally or by repeating the mantras in the prescribed manner during the prajapatya sacrifice or offer oblation in waters or by performing rituals in the manner prescribed in the veda otherwise he will be heading to a fall degradation \n when desirelessness arises in the mind towards all objects then authorities sanction renunciation by such person contrariwise he shall fall from virtue \n a wise man when disillusioned with the world may become a mendicant monk when a person has attachments he shall reside in his house\n that degraded brahmana who turns ascetic when he has attachments indeed goes to hell\n that brahmana in the stage of a disciplined celibate student may take to renunciation wiyout getting married whose tongue genitals stomach and hands are well guarded i\n they are under perfect control \n seeing worldly life as completely devoid of substance and with a desire to realize the essence of all they renounce the world wiyout getting married being imbued with great dispassion\n all non spiritual activity is characterised by the play of an active part in worldly affairs true knowledge is the characteristic of renunciation\n hence placing in front i\n preferring wisdom an intelligent man will renounce the world\n when a person realizes that the supreme reality is the eternal brahman alone he shall taking up the single emblematic staff give up the tuft of hair along with the sacred thread\n he who is attached to the supreme self paramatman is detached from things other than that paramatman freed from all desires it behoves on his part to eat food given as alms\n when a person who becomes very pleased when he is honoured and respectfully saluted becomes similarly very pleased when he is being beaten then he is a true mendicant monk subsisting on alms \n i am the indestructible non dual brahman alone called vasudeva lord vishnu he whose firm attitude is thus established becomes a true mendicant monk\n he is in the stage leading to final beatitude in whom are found peace quiescence purity truth contentment straightforwardness absence of any possession and false airs\n when a person has no evil propensity towards all beings in deed yought and speech he becomes a true mendicant monk\n attentively discharging his duties characterised by the ten virtues and studying in the prescribed manner the upanishads vedanta a twice born dvija having discharged the three debts may renounce worldly life\n the ten virtues characterising right conduct dharma are contentment forgiveness selfcontrol non stealing purity control of the senses humility scriptural learning truth and an even temper\n he abides in the stage leading to final emancipation who remembers not with longing past pleasures as also those not yet experienced nor does he exult in those that have arrived\n he who is always able to keep the inward faculties of senses within and the outward objects of sense outside wiyout any reaction resides in the stage leading to final beatitude\n just as when the vital breath has departed the body no longer experiences pleasure and pain he the sage is such even when he is alive lit\n when he is united with the vital breath then he stays in the stage leading to final emancipation kaivalya \n a pair of loin cloth a patched garment against the cold of winter and a single emblematic staff constitute the accoutrements of the highest class of ascetics paramahamsa no more is allowed by scriptural law if he were to possess more accoutrements for comfort he will go to the dreadful hell raurava and be renunciation born in the species of animals\n he may wear outwardly a patched garment strung out of pieces of discarded but clean cloth after dyeing it with ochre\n wearing a single garment or unclad his vision on one alone i\n liberation and wiyout longing for pleasures the paramahamsa shall always be on the move alone in the rainy season alone he may stay in one place\n giving up his house hold kinsmen children and wife all branches of the veda sacrificial rites and the sacred thread the ascetic shall journey alone wiyout attracting attention to him \n abandoning faults such as passion anger pride greed and delusion the mendicant monk shall remain free from mine ness nirmamah \n ridding himself of love and hatred viewing equally on clod stone and gold and desisting from injuring all beings the ascetic shall remain free from all desires\n an ascetic will attain liberation when he is freed of pride and egoit ism devoid of hurting and wickedness and possessed of the virtues of self knowledge\n by attachment to the pleasures of the senses one undoubtedly comes to harm restraining them alone well one attains final beatitude\n desires do not subside by giving scope for their enjoyment like fire fed by oblation they only increase all the more\n that person is to be known as one who has conquered his senses who neither rejoices in nor dislikes the objects having heard touched eaten seen or smelt them\n he reaps all the fruits promised by the vedanta upanishads whose speech and mind are ever pure and always well guarded\n a brahmana in quest of liberation should always recoil from honours as from poison he should always welcome disregard as he would nectar\n a person illused forgetting it sleeps soundly wakes up in good humour and goes about his work in the world happily but the insulter comes to grief\n one should bear patiently with abusive language and never insult another nor should he in this embodied state create enmity with anyone\n one shall not return anger for anger when abused he shall speak gently for the welfare of all one should never speak an untrue word which feeds worldly desires of the seven gates of the body \n taking delight in the supreme light manifested in the individual self remaining quiescent free from desires and blessings seeking supreme bliss he the ascetic should move about as a mendicant monk with the self alone as his companion\n he becomes fit for immortality by subduing the senses enervating feelings of love and hatred and by non injury to living beings\n this body pillared by bones bound together by tendons plastered with flesh and blood covered by skin foul smelling filled with urine and faeces subject to old age and affliction an abode of diseases liable to injury full of passion impermanent and the abode of the elements i\n the body one may abandon wiyout regret \n if one were to take delight in the body which is a conglomerate of flesh blood pus faeces urine tendons marrow and bones that fool will be delighted in hell as well\n the attitude i am the body is the same as the path leading to the hell called kalasutra the trap for mahavichi hell and a series of forest hells where the trees have leaves as sharp as swords\n even if total ruin faces one this identifying the body with the self should be abandoned by every effort it should not be touched accepted by a nobly born person just as a low born tribal woman carrying dog s meat\n abandoning both virtuous acts towards one s dear ones and evil deeds towards unfriendly people a person attains the eternal brahman by the practice of deep meditation dhyana yoga \n by this method abandoning all attachments gradually and freed from the influence of all the pairs of opposites such as pleasure and pain one gets established in brahman alone\n the ascetic shall journey alone wiyout any helper for attaining final beatitude for seeing the perfection of the one brahman he neither abandons it nor is he abandoned by it \n a skull for an alms bowl shelter under the shade of trees ragged garments solitude and equanimity in all things such is the characteristic of the liberated\n benign to all beings calm wearing three fold emblematic staff carrying a water pot delighting in the one brahman having become a mendicant monk thus he may enter a village for alms\n the mendicant monk shall be alone as stated before two together are declared to be a pair having attachment to each other three together are said to constitute a village with their bickerings more than these three become a city of bustle and confusion \n the city of ascetics should not be created nor the village nor the pair an ascetic doing forming part of these three falls off his rightful duty\n due to their close association there will doubtless be talks on royal personages etc\n mutual luck in alms and also affection tale bearing and rivalry among them\n he shall remain alone and wiyout desires he shall not converse with any one\n he shall utter narayana alone as the reply always to other s statements \n in solitude he shall contemplate on brahman whole heartedly in yought word and deed\n he shall not by any means either welcome death or rejoice in life\n he shall only mark time when pracit ising asceticism till the allotted span of life is completed he shall neither welcome death nor rejoice in living\n he shall await the time of death alone as an employee awaits orders\n a mendicant monk gets liberation when he possesses the following six characteristics he is tongueless in relishing food and speech a eunuch in sex lame in push blind in seeing sense objects deaf in hearing praise or curse and innocent like a child \n there is no doubt about it\n that ascetic is said to be tongueless who while eating food is not conscious of its being savoury or otherwise and who speaks words beneficial and truthful in moderation\n he is a eunuch who is unaffected on seeing a female whether newly born sixteen year old or one of a hundred years\n when an ascetic goes about only for alms and answering calls of nature and does not exceed a distance of thirteen or fourteen kilometres in a day he is by all means a lame person\n that mendicant monk is said to be blind whose eyes being modestly lowered while standing still or walking do not see far excepting sixteen cubits of ground before him \n hearing words beneficial or otherwise pleasing to the mind or causing grief he seems not to hear them i\n remains equanimous such a sage is said to be deaf\n that mendicant monk is said to be childlike who always remains as if asleep in the presence of objects of sensory pleasures yough his senses are efficient and unimpaired\n show by dancers etc\n gambling lady friend of former days eatables heaped temptingly other enjoyable things and a woman in her courses these an ascetic shall always avoid\n an ascetic shall never even think of in his mind these six love hatred intoxication bamboozling hurting and deluding others\n a bedstead white clothes talk on women unsteadiness daytime sleep and a carriage these six cause the fall of ascetics\n one who thinks on the self shall painstakingly avoid long journeys\n the ascetic shall always be pracit ising the lore of the upanishads which is the means for liberation\n the ascetic shall not always be resorting to a place of pilgrimage nor be undergoing fasts frequently he shall not be studying the scripture all the time nor be expounding them exclusively\n he shall always conduct himself wiyout committing sin deceit and devious acts restraining his senses in every way as a tortoise does its limbs\n he will be released from worldly bondage when the functioning of his senses and the mind has become quiescent is free of hopes of gain and possessions is indifferent to the pairs of opposites pleasure and pain etc\n reverential salutation and the exercise of his will nihsvadhakara is free from mine ness egoit ism expectations and blessings and sticks to solitude\n there is no doubt about it\n thus are the duties of ascetics \n a disciplined celibate student a householder or a forest dweller vanaprastha may renounce worldly life when he is ever vigilant in leading a righteous life possesses proficiency in action has devotion and wisdom and comes to possess dispassion of his own accord\n if he is chiefly interested in the particular stage of his life he shall complete the stage of studentship and become a householder from the stage of a householder becoming a forest dweller he shall thereafter renounce the world\n or otherwise he may renounce worldly life from the stage of a student or householder or forest dweller\n but then a person may renounce that very day on which he gets disillusioned with the world whether he is one who observes not vows before the stage of renunciation or observes them whether he has undergone the prescribed ablution on completing the disciplined studentship or not whether he is one who has discontinued maintaining the ritual fire at the death of his wife utsannagni or is one who does not maintain for other causes the ritual fire anagnika \n some law givers prescribe the sacrifice called prajapatya of which god brahma is the presiding deity to a twice born before he embraces renunciation \n but yough thus said he may not do so\n he shall only perform the agneyi sacrifice whose presiding deity is agni the god of fire \n for agni is the vital breath prana \n thereby he does strengthen the vital breath\n then he shall perform the traidhataviya sacrifice whose presiding deity is the god indra \n by this sacrifice the three vital fluids become strong like fire namely the sattva semen rajas blood and tamas the dark one \n having performed the sacrifice in the prescribed manner he shall smell the holy fire reciting the following mantra oh fire this vital breath is your source as you are born at the proper time of the year you put on effulgence\n knowing him the atman your ultimate source may you merge with the prana your source \n may you increase our wealth of transcendent knowledge \n thus reciting the mantra he shall smell the fire\n this is the source of fire this vital air\n may you go unto prana may you go unto your source\n thus alone this mantra says\n having secured the ritual fire from the ahavaniya sacred fire he shall smell it as before\n if he is unable to procure the ritual fire he shall offer the oblation in the waters\n for water is presided over by all the gods\n reciting the mantra i offer the oblation to all the gods svaha he shall tender the oblation and picking up a small portion left over of the offered oblation which is mixed with ghee he shall eat it mixed with water\n the oblation mixed with ghee is beneficial and gives leads to liberation\n thus it has been declared \n only after discarding the tuft of hair sacred thread parents son wife normal work study mantras other than those prescribed for ascetics a wise man knower of spiritual knowledge renounces worldly life\n by the mantras of liberation pertaining to the traidhataviya sacrifice he shall attain final beatitude \n that is brahman that should reverently be resorted to\n thus alone is this liberation attained \n narada again asked of the grandfather brahma how is he being now wiyout the sacred thread a brahmana the god brahma said to him as follows \n taking a shave with the removal of the tuft a wise man shall discard the external sacred thread\n he shall wear as the thread i\n he shall always be conscious of the transcendent brahman which is indestructible\n the sutra is so called as it indicates brahman \n the sutra is indeed the supreme state\n that brahmana alone has completely mastered the vedas who has realized that sutra\n the yogin the knower of yoga and the perceiver of the truth shall possess that sutra brahman by which everything is held together sustained as a group of gems by a thread\n established in the highest yoga a wise man shall abandon the external sacred thread\n he is wise who possesses the sutra the state of brahman\n possessing that sutra he becomes neither unholy or impure\n those who have the sutra inwardly and possess the sacred thread of wisdom are indeed the knowers of the sutra they wear the true sacred thread\n those who wear a tuft of hair in the form of wisdom jnana whose fundamental condition is wisdom who possess the sacred thread of wisdom to whom wisdom alone is supreme have it is said pure knowledge\n that wise man whose tuft consists of wisdom like the flame in the case of fire and no other is said to be the possessor of sikha tuft pre eminence not others who merely bear a lock of hair on the crown of the head\n the brahmana and such others who are engaged in vedic rites are to wear this sacred thread for it is declared to be part of the ceremony\n he whose tuft consists of wisdom as also his sacred thread of that wisdom has all the requisites of a brahmana so understand the knowers of the veda\n knowing thus the duties of ascetics a brahmana having renounced worldly life becomes a mendicant monk wearing a single garment and shaven headed he receives no gifts other than simple food for bare sustenance if he is unable to bear bodily privation of an unclad unsoliciting avadhuta ascetic \n or according to prescribed rules becoming unclad lit\n possessing a form as when newly born renouncing his children friends wife close kinsmen etc\n his vedic study and rituals abandoning the entire world his loin cloth emblematic staff and warm garment being capable of putting up with the pairs of opposites pleasure and pain etc\n and unmindful of cold and heat pleasure and pain sleep honour and dishonour and the six human infirmities hunger etc\n leaving off censuring egoit ism rivalry pride false airs jealousy envy desire hatred pleasure pain love anger covetousness delusion etc\n remembering his body as a corpse not conscious of anything other than the self both inwardly and outwardly not bowing to anyone having neither the utterance of svaha in worshipping the gods nor the utterance of svadha in honour of the manes indulging neither in praise nor blame he thus becomes independent of extraneous influences\n contented with food alone that comes unsolicited he shall not accept gifts of gold etc\n he does neither the invocation of deities nor utter mantras to send them back he has not mantra or non mantra meditation or worship aim or non aim separation or union and being of firm mind in regard to residence has no home to sleep in at night other than a deserted house the shade of a tree a temple a clump of tall grass a potter s shed a hut where ritual fire is kept the southeast quarter the sandy bank of a river a cellar cave or grounds near water falls or in a forest\n he may have no distinctive emblem of an ascetic like the great sages of yore such as svetaketu ribhu nidagha rishabha durvasas samvartaka dattatreya and raivataka\n his conduct is incomprehensible to ordinary people like the conduct of children mad men and ghosts\n though perfectly sane he behaves like an insane person\n muttering svaha he shall discard all these in the waters the threefold emblematic staff sling to carry his effects alms bowl water vessel waist band and loin cloth\n he shall journey as a mendicant monk unclad leaving in the waters all these the waistband loin cloth the emblematic staff garment and water vessel\n he shall seek the realization of the self\n remaining unclad free from the influence of the pairs of opposites receiving no gifts well established in the path of the reality of brahman with his mind pure eating food to sustain life at the prescribed hour with his hand or otherwise placed in the mouth wiyout begging equanimous in gain or denial of food wiyout mine ness deeply interested in meditating on the pure effulgence i\n brahman devoted to the supreme spirit manifested as the individual self deeply engaged in rooting out the effect of good and bad actions he shall renounce all other than the self having only one yought namely of supreme bliss ever recollecting brahman in the form of pranava om and that he is brahman alone he shall give up the threefold body according to the maxim of the wasp to become one with brahman and abandon the body by renunciation alone\n he becomes one who has fulfilled himself i\n he attains liberation in the disembodied state \n thus ends the third upadesha of the upanishad\n he who abandons the three worlds the vedas objects of senses the influence of the sense and remains established in the atman alone attains the highest goal\n a good ascetic shall never answer the inquiry on his name lineage etc\n his native place duration of his stay there study of the scripture family age conduct and the vows observed by him\n he shall neither converse with any woman nor remember one seen before he shall avoid all talks on them and never look at one even in a picture\n the mind of an ascetic will necessarily get disturbed on his doing the four things regarding women mentioned above due to this agitation of the mind he is lost\n an ascetic comes down from his high position if he has greed anger untruth bamboozling covetousness delusion likes and dislikes love of fine art explaining tendency desire passion accepting gifts egoit ism mine ness pracit ising medicine enforcing right conduct in others expiatory acts journeying abroad into unholy places and the practice of mantras herbs poisons and blessing others which are prohibited\n a sage intent on liberation shall not speak words such as come go stop welcome friends and honouring \n a mendicant monk shall neither accept gifts nor induce others to offer donation nor prompt others to give or take gifts at any time even in a dream\n hearing or seeing good or bad of his former wife brother children etc\n and kinsmen he shall not get agitated he shall give up sorrow and delusion\n abstaining from injury having truthfulness non stealing continence non acquiring humility absence of depression serenity stability straight forwardness freedom from affection serving respectable elders faith forgiveness calmness non alignment fortitude amiability endurance compassion modesty knowledge and wisdom contemplation of the supreme spirit yoga very moderate diet and contentment these are well known as the essential requisites of self controlled ascetics\n free from the influence of the pairs of opposites ever established in goodness equanimous in everything the sage in the fourth stage of asceticism the paramahamsa is the visible god narayana\n except in the rainy season he may stay one night in a village and five nights in a city during the rains he may stay four months in a village or town \n the mendicant monk shall not stay two nights in a village if he stays affection etc\n may find scope to deflect him thereby he will go to hell\n in the outskirts of a village in a secluded spot he may pitch his camp and go about for alms like a worm crawling on the ground during the rains he shall stay in one place\n clad in a single garment or unclad with his vision fixed in the one brahman free from desires undeflected from the path of the good and deeply meditating he shall walk the earth\n pracit ising his essential duties in a pure place always a mendicant monk shall ever be on the move his eye fixed on the ground\n he shall never journey at night midday or during the two twilights neither in a deserted place nor an impassable region nor a place causing harm to creatures\n a mendicant monk may stay one night in a village two nights in a small town three nights in a big town and five nights in a city\n during the rains he may camp in one place which has plenty of pure water\n seeing all beings as like unto himself a mendicant monk shall walk the earth like a person blind dull witted deaf mad and dumb\n a bahudaka mendicant monk and a forest dweller it is declared are to have a bath at the three periods junctures of the day the hamsa ascetic but once a day and a paramahamsa ascetic has none prescribed \n the ascetic carrying a single emblematic staff shall observe these seven things silence yoga posture deep meditation endurance solitude desirelessness and equanimity\n one at the stage of a paramahamsa due to the absence of prescribed rules in regard to bath etc\n shall merely give up all the activities of the mind\n what difference is there between worms revelling in putrid waters and men who take delight in the body consisting of skin flesh blood tendons marrow fat bones faeces urine and pus where on the one hand is the body a great conglomerate of all foul things such as phlegm and others and where on the other hand are merits such as bodily splendour auspiciousness and personal charm if a fool takes delight in his body which is a conglomerate of flesh blood pus faeces urine tendons marrow and bones he will be delighted in hell as well\n though there is no difference between the unmentionable region of women and a purified ulcer people are generally deceived by the difference in outlook\n a piece of skin split in twain and perfumed by the apana wind a bow to those who take delight in it what is greater rashness than this the wise ascetic has no worldly work to do nor has he any emblem\n the sage free from mine ness and fear calm uninfluenced by the pairs of opposites taking food wiyout castedistinction clad in loin cloth or unclad shall remain deeply engaged in meditation\n thus the yogin solely devoted to wisdom is fit for identity with brahman\n even yough he may carry an emblem such as the staff the real cause of his liberation is his spiritual knowledge alone\n to the people here in the matter of attaining final beatitude an assemblage of emblems is meaningless\n he is a brahmana knower of brahman who knows not the difference between one who is good or bad unlearned or highly learned in scripture of good or bad character\n therefore a wise ascetic shall move about unobtrusively wiyout any emblem knowing right conduct devoted to the vow of realizing brahman and resorting to the secret doctrine i\n he shall journey over the earth a mystery to all people devoid of class or stage of life as yough he were blind dull witted and dumb\n seeing him calm in mind the gods desire to be like him\n as he observes no distinction he attains the distinctionless final beatitude\n thus the teaching of the god brahma\n thus it ends \n then narada asked of brahma the grandfather pray expound to us the method of renunciation \n the god brahma agreeing to it saying be it so declared for embracing the fourth stage of life i\n renunciation whether one is in a state of emergency or in the regular sequence one shall perform the eight commemorative religious ceremonies astasraddha after having first undergone the penance to expiate all sins kricchraprayaschitta the eight ceremonies being the propitiation of the gods sages of yore other divine beings men the five primary elements manes father mother and one s self\n first he shall propitiate the group of deities named satya vasu etc\n in the commemorative ceremony for the gods brahma vishnu and maheshvara siva in the sraddha ceremony for the sages divine sages like narada royal sages like janaka and men sages like yajnavalkya in the sraddha for divine beings the eight vasus the eleven rudras and the twelve adityas suns in the sraddha for men sanaka sanandana sanatkumara and sanatsujata son of the god brahma in the sraddha for the elements the five primary elements earth etc\n the sensory organs such as

and paternal great grandmother in the sraddha for one s self one self father and paternal grandfather if his father is alive leaving off the father himself paternal grandfather and paternal great grandfather\n in all cases he shall honour the brahmanas arranging that two of them are present each time\n having honoured the brahmanas in the manner prescribed for the ceremony of the daily offerings to deceased ancestors pitryajna during the eight sraddhas performed in eight days or in a day with the mantras pertaining to his own branch of the veda following the option of a single ceremony a day or eight ceremonies on the same day having completed the rituals according to rules till they are fed having performed the offering of rice balls to the manes and bidding farewell to the brahmanas pleased with the presents and betel rolls having saved seven hairs for the success of the remaining ritual acts the twice born having had seven or eight hairs shaved together along with

above said seven hairs completing the evening twilight worship muttering the gayatri mantra a yousand times performing the daily teaching and study of the vedas getting ready his own ritual fire completing the recital of his branch of the veda offering the oblation of ghee in the fire as stated in it his vedic branch till agni and soma have been propitiated completing the act of offering oblations ceremoniously eating the barley meal three times invoking himself etc\n keeping alive the fire after having ceremoniously sipped water achamana seating himself in a skin of the black antelope at the north of the fire keeping awake listening to the recital of puranas bathing at the end of the fourth watch of the night boiling the oblation in that fire offering the rice oblation sixteen times reciting the purusha sukta performing the viraja ritual so as to be free from all sins sipping water ceremoniously and gifting clothes gold vessel and cow along with a cash present completing the preceding rituals bidding farewell to the god brahma who had been invoked invoking the fire to be symbolically present on his person reciting the mantras may the maruts bring together the scattered vital energy may indra do so may brihaspati do so may this fire do so granting along with long life wealth and strength may he make me long lived \n oh agni come with your body which is fit for sacrifice\n you being my self may you climb into my body bringing before me great wealth suitable for men\n assuming the form of sacrifice may you rest in my body your source\n oh fire being born of the earth may you come with your abode meditating on fire bidding farewell to him after having circumambulated and prostrated in reverence before him worshipping the morning twilight paying obeisance to the sun reciting the gayatri mantra a yousand times seated in the waters which reach up to his navel bidding farewell to gayatri having made respectful offerings to the eight guardian deities of the quarters mingling the gayatri with the vyahriit is bhur bhuvas suvas and reciting in a low middling or high tone or mentally the mantras i am the stimulator of the tree of the phenomenal world \n fame of my knowledge is lofty like the peak of a mountain\n high and holy i am the immortal being as the immortal self in the sun\n i am the wealth of the self endowed with effulgence\n possessing true knowledge i am immersed in my immortal nature\n thus the words of self realization based on the veda of trisanku a realized soul \n he the om who is the most exalted of the vedas and omnipresent and who has sprung from the ambrosial scripture may that om the supreme lord endow me with true intelligence\n may i oh lord become the possessor of wisdom leading to immortality my body very active in the higher life my tongue speech possessed of sweetness to the highest degree\n may i with my ears listen to the wealth of vedantic learning \n you are the sheath of brahman concealed by worldly intelligence while please rent asunder \n pray protect my wisdom born of the study of the scripture i am now risen above the desire for wife desire for wealth and desire for worldly glory \n om bhuh i have renounced the world \n om bhuvah i have renounced \n om suvah i have renounced \n sipping water ceremoniously reciting the mantra freedom from fear to all beings everything emanates from memory svaha offering water to the east with the palms fully folded and uprooting the sikha of seven hairs reciting om svaha snapping the sacred thread reciting the mantras the sacred thread is highly sanctifying it has been natural to the god brahma prajapati in the first place foremost in promoting long life put on thus\n may the bright fresh sacred thread be the strength and effulgence unto me let not the sacred thread reside externally may you entering inside into the middle of the heart ever grant me the highly sanctifying fame strength wisdom and dispassion and true intelligence \n offering water with cupped palms he shall offer the sacred thread as oblation to the waters reciting the mantra om bhuh pray reach the sea svaha \n repeating thrice om bhuh i have renounced om bhuvah i have renounced om suvah i have renounced he shall ceremoniously sip water and discard in the waters his garment and waist band reciting om bhuh svaha \n reminding himself that he had ceased from all worldly activities and becoming unclad he shall start for the north with his hand raised and thinking of his self\n if as stated before he is an enlightened recluse he shall receive instruction from his guru on the pranava om and the great scriptural texts such as thou art that journeying as a mendicant monk in easy stages convinced that no one exists other than his self and subsisting on fruits edible leaves and water and thus move about on hills forests and temples\n then unclad giving up journeying all over the earth his heart solely filled with the experience of bliss always profited by the complete severance of worldly activities sustaining life by means of fruits juicy barks leaves bulbous roots and water only for attaining liberation he shall discard his body in some mountain cave remembering the emancipating mantra om \n if he is a recluse desiring further study vividisha sannyasin he shall proceed along with learned brahmanas like his preceptor etc\n and receiving a staff waistband loin cloth garment and water vessel offered by his preceptors reciting pray wait wait blessed one take the staff ochre garment and water vessel he shall go to the spiritual guide s presence to receive instruction in the pranava om and the great scriptural texts mahavakyas \n he shall then receive the emblematic bamboo staff which is free from cuts from the tip of the top evenly shaped smooth free from black colour and is auspicious looking having first sipped water ceremoniously and repeating the mantra you are my friend\n you my friend are indra s weapon vajra the destroyer of the demon vritra\n may you bring protection to me\n prevent that which is a sin \n he shall then receive the water vessel reciting the pranava first and then the mantra you are the life of the world you are the container of water you who are always cool \n receiving the waist band loin cloth and the ochre garment reciting the mantra in the due order the waist band the supporter of the loin cloth om the cover for the privities the loincloth om the garment which is the protection against cold wind and heat om and invested with the yoga cloth cloth used for meditation preceded by the ceremonial sipping of water he shall zealously follow the rules of his stage of life i\n asceticism considering that he has fulfilled himself in the quest for liberation \n thus ends the fourth upadesha of the upanishad\n then narada asked of the god brahma lord you have said that renunciation entails ceasing from all activity\n again you have said that one shall be zealous in the conduct of one s stage of life \n then the god brahma replied to the embodied being there are the four stages of waking dreaming sleeping and the fourth stage turiya \n under their influence people who engage themselves in action knowledge and dispassion conform to them in their conduct \n if this is so lord how many kinds of renunciation are there what are the differences in their practice pray expound to us completely \n agreeing to this saying be it so the god brahma said to him as follows \n if the question is raised how does conduct differ in the varieties of renunciation the answer is that renunciation is really one only that it becomes threefold due to imperfection of knowledge vidvatsannyasa incapacity vividisha sannyasa and failure in action atura sannyasa and it attains the four stages of renunciation due to dispassion renunciation due to wisdom renunciation due to wisdom and dispassion and renunciation of action\n this is how it is\n due to the absence of wicked passion by indifference to objects of pleasure and by the influence of good actions done before one who renounces the world is called the renouncer due to dispassion\n due to the knowledge of the scripture shastras withdrawing from the phenomenal world by listening to sinful and auspicious experiences of the world desisting from all the world composed of anger jealousy intolerance egoit ism and pride discarding bodily inclinations such as desire for wife desire for wealth and desire for worldly glory excessive regard for the shastras and public esteem considering all these common things to be eschewed as vomit endowed with the four disciplines such as discrimination or permanent and transitory things he who renounces thus alone is a renouncer due to wisdom\n having studied all scripture in due order and experienced all worldly life one who influenced by wisdom cum dispassion and deep meditation on the self becomes an unclad ascetic is the renouncer due to wisdom cum dispassion\n having completed the course of disciplined student ship in celibacy becoming a householder reaching the stage of a forest dweller he who thereafter renounces the world in accordance with the order of the stages of life even in the absence of dispassion is a renouncer of worldly activities\n renouncing the world in celibacy and becoming unclad in renunciation such is the renouncer due to dispassion\n the renouncer due to scriptural learning is the renouncer due to wisdom\n the renouncer due to imperfect knowledge is the renouncer of worldly activity\n renunciation of activity is of two kinds renunciation due to some cause and renunciation wiyout an adventitious cause\n the one with cause is the afflicted and is at the point of death the causeless is renunciation in the regular order\n the afflicted skips over all preliminary ritual acts it is renunciation at the point of the departure of the vital breath this is renunciation due to some cause\n hale in body but convinced that created things are transient and hence all things such as the body are fit to be abandoned the individual soul non different from brahman pervading pure ether the sun vasu remaining in the sky the fire that rests in the altar of the universe the guest residing in the house of the sacrifice residing in men dwelling in the superior gods resting in truth residing in the sky as the sun born in the waters born on earth as grain etc\n born as sacrificial truth born in mountains as rivers this truth brahman is truly great\n convinced that everything other than brahman is transcient and as a result he renounces that renunciation is renunciation wiyout an adventitious cause\n renunciation is of six kinds kutichaka bahudaka hamsa paramahamsa turiyatita and avadhuta\n the kutichaka ascetic wears tuft and sacred thread carries an emblematic staff and water vessel puts on a loin cloth and patched garment is devoted to the service of father mother and preceptor has recourse to the assistance of using mantras for the vessel pithara spade khanitra and sling sikya is addicted to eating food in one place puts on the forehead a perpendicular sign of white sandal and has a three fold emblematic staff\n the bahudaka ascetic wears tuft etc\n and patched garment puts on the forehead a mark consisting of three horizontal lines of holy ashes looks on all equally like the kutichaka and subsists on eight mouthfuls of food gathered from different places like a bee\n the hamsa ascetic wears matted hair puts on the forehead a horizontal mark of holy ashes or a perpendicular mark of sandal subsists on food gathered wiyout pre determination like a bee and wears loincloth and khandatunda a piece of cloth covering the mouth \n the paramahamsa ascetic wears no tuft or sacred thread subsists only on food taken at night and gathered from five houses has his hand serving as alms bowl wears a single loincloth and a single garment carries one bamboo staff or wears a single garment smears holy ashes all over the body and renounces everything\n the turiyatita ascetic is cow faced eats food at random wiyout using hands eats fruits only or if he takes cooked food gets it from three houses i\n three mouthfuls has his body just alive is unclad and has his body as yough it were a corpse due to insensibility by nirvikalpa samadhi \n the avadhuta ascetic follows no rules subsists on food that comes to him as is the practice of a python from all classes of people excepting those who are accused or fallen and is solely devoted to the realization of his self\n if one lives in great affliction of bodily infirmities he shall renounce the world in the due order by getting instruction in pranava and the mahavakyas from his guru \n to the kutichaka bahudaka and hamsa ascetics the method of renunciation of the kutichakas applies just as renunciation is embraced after completing the stages of brahmaacharya etc\n ending with the fourth stage namely renunciation \n the rule is that the triad of the paramahamsa etc\n has no waist band loincloth garment water vessel or staff their soliciting alms shall be from all classes of people and they shall be unclad\n even in the stage of renunciation they may study the scripture till they feel fully sait isfied and thereafter discard in the waters the waistband loincloth staff garment and water vessel\n then if unclad there shall not be any vestige of patched garment\n they shall neither study nor expound the scripture \n there is nothing whatsoever for them worth hearing\n other than the pranava om they shall not cultivate any science of logic not even the verbal authority i\n he shall not speak much in expounding sacred texts he shall not stultify by his words the words of the great he shall not communicate by making signs with his hands etc\n nor shall he use other special means of communication\n he shall not speak to the low class of people women the fallen and specially to women in their courses\n to the ascetic there is no worship of the gods nor seeing the deities during festivals nor any journey on pilgrimage\n again on the different kinds of ascetics\n in the rule relating to the kutichaka the receiving of alms is from one house to the bahudaka it is at random as in the case of a bee gathering honey to the hamsa it is eight mouthfuls collected from eight houses to the paramahamsa five mouthfuls collected from five houses the hand being the alms bowl to the turiyatita the food consists of fruits put into his mouth gomukha to the avadhuta the food comes to him as in the case of a python from all classes of people\n the ascetic shall not stay many nights in the same place \n he shall not bow to any one\n to the turiyatita and avadhuta none is superior\n he who knows not the self yough the eldest is yet the youngest in wisdom \n he shall not swim across a river nor climb a tree nor travel in a carriage\n he shall not indulge in buying and selling nor barter even the least\n he shall not put on airs nor speak an untruth\n there is no duty enjoined on an ascetic\n if there is then he will have to mix with people pracit ising religious observances which is undesirable \n hence ascetics have the right only to meditation etc\n the renouncer in an emergency and the kutichaka ascetic attain the worlds of bhur and bhuvar respectively\n the bahudaka ascetic attains heaven svarga \n the hamsa sage attains the highest heaven of tapoloka\n the paramahamsa reaches the abode of brahma and of truth satyaloka \n the turiyatita and the avadhuta attain final beatitude in the individual self by deeply meditating on the self according to the maxim of the wasp and the worm\n whatever the state one remembers when discarding the body at death the same he attains after death \n the teaching of the scripture is never false \n thus having known the procedure barring investigation into the nature of the self the ascetic shall not devote himself to any other practice\n as a result of such practice there is the attainment of the respective worlds such as heaven etc\n by one endowed with wisdom and dispassion liberation is attained in himself hence there is no adherence to any other practice\n adherence to any other practice will be useless for attaining final beatitude \n to the embodied self there are the three states of waking dreaming and deep sleep in the waking state it has the faculty to perceive individuality vishva in the dreaming state the subtle essence of light taijasa in the state of deep sleep intelligence dependent on individuality prajna \n due to the difference in the state there is the difference in the conditioned lord ishvara \n for the difference in effect there is the difference in the cause\n in these three states the material cause for such differences is the external and internal activity of the fourteen sensory organs\n the mental states are four the mind manas intelligence buddhi ego ahamkara and the heart chitta \n there is clear difference in practices due to the difference in the activity of the mental states\n know the individual self to be awake when it remains in the eye when in the throat it enters the dreaming state it is in the heart in deep sleep but remaining in the head it is the fourth state turiya \n knowing the turiya to be the indestructible brahman he who remains as yough unconscious of all happenings such as whatever is heard or seen remains as one in the state of deep sleep yough he is in the waking state\n in him even in the dreaming state such condition of non consciousness prevails\n the shastras say that he is one who is liberated while living \n the exposition of the meaning of all scriptures is that such a person alone attains liberation\n a mendicant monk does not hanker after this world or the next i\n svarga the heaven of varying enjoyments with a time limit \n if he has such expectation he becomes one in accordance with that\n by ritual practices of the scripture other than investigation into the self he does a useless thing like the burden borne by a camel of a load of saffron flowers\n for him there is no practice of the science of yoga no pursuit of the lore of the sankhya nor application of the mantras and rituals\n if an ascetic pracit ises lores other than selfrealization it is like adorning a corpse\n as a cobbler is far away from the performance of vedic rituals so is he from the practice of brahma vidya by his rituals \n he is not to devote himself to repeat the pranava\n whatever activity he does he has to reap the fruit there of\n hence discarding all ritual acts like the foam in castor oil and seeing the unclad ascetic engaged in it self realization with complete control over the mind and using the hand as the alms bowl the mendicant monk shall truly renounce all worldly attachments \n like the child mad man or a goblin the mendicant monk shall not desire either for death or life but shall merely mark time according to the maxim of a servant awaiting orders\n if an ascetic merely lives on the alms devoid of the qualities of forbearance wisdom dispassion tranquillity etc\n he is a bane of the conduct of ascetics\n not by bearing an emblematic staff not by a shaven head not by special dress not by hypocritical airs of sage hood does liberation come to one \n he who bears the staff of wisdom is said to be single staffed \n the ascetic who carries a wooden stick eats all sorts of food and is devoid of wisdom goes to terrible hells called maharaurava\n a stable position in a monastery is said by great sages to be similar to the excreta of a sow hence leaving it aside the ascetic shall move about like an assiduous worm\n the turiyatita ascetic shall have food and clothing wiyout solicitation and just as they happen to occur by others will\n he shall be unclad and have a bath at others will\n the ascetic whose behaviour is well in harmony even with the dreaming state as with the waking state is considered the best he is the most excellent among those that follow the vedanta\n in non acquirement of alms he shall not grieve in its acquisition he shall not feel joy\n avoiding attachment to material things he shall simply keep himself alive for a higher purpose \n he shall in all cases shrink from being honoured by admiring disciples the ascetic who welcomes such honour gets bound with worldly ties yough liberated\n for the sake of bare subsistence an ascetic may go about for alms to the houses of approved classes of people i\n the twice borns at the proper time when they have dined after the fire ritual\n using his hand as a vessel for receiving food the ascetic shall not solicit alms more than once a day he may eat the food standing he may eat the food walking\n there is no ceremonial sipping of water in between\n the ascetics with pure youghts keep within the limits of good behaviour like the sea these great men do not abandon the prescribed course of conduct like the sun\n when the ascetic seeks food with his mouth alone like a cow he shall then be equanimous in all beings he is then fit for immortality\n going to a house which is not forbidden for alms he shall avoid a house which is prohibited\n he shall enter the house when the door is open he shall never go towards the house when it is closed\n he shall shelter for the night in a deserted house covered with dust or he may shelter under a tree giving up all likes and dislikes\n the ascetic shall go to sleep where he is when the sun sets and be free of ritual fire and fixed abode\n he shall live on what comes at random self possessed and senses subdued\n departing from human habitations and resorting to a forest possessing true knowledge and senses subdued moving about awaiting the time of death the ascetic becomes fit for absorption into brahman\n the sage who moves about desisting from causing fear to all beings has nowhere fear from any being\n free from pride and egoit ism unaffected by the pairs of opposites with all doubts dispelled the ascetic never gets angry nor hates any one and does not utter a false word\n moving in holy places causing no injury to living beings and receiving alms at the proper time the sage is fit for absorption into brahman\n he shall at no time associate himself with the forest dwellers vanaprasthas and the householders\n he shall desire to move about unobtrusively\n joy of any kind shall not enter him\n his path indicated by the sun he shall walk the earth unhurriedly like a worm\n actions entailing blessing and those connected with injury as well as those intended for the welfare of the world these the ascetic shall neither perform nor cause others to do\n he shall not be attached to heterodox doctrines nor pursue a means of living\n he shall not indulge in assertive arguments nor lean to either side in a debate\n he shall not have a following of disciples nor study many books\n he shall not utilise a commentary nor initiate inaugural functions anywhere\n wiyout displaying any distinctive emblem or motive the ascetic shall show himself to the people as a mad man or a child or a dumb person yough he is all wise\n he shall neither do nor speak on anything\n he shall have no youghts good or bad\n delighting in the self the sage shall move about leading this way of life\n he shall move about the country alone free from attachment his senses subdued playing with and rejoicing in the self self possessed equanimous\n wise but playful like a child well versed but appearing dull witted the ascetic shall journey\n learned he may speak like a mad man\n seeking food like a cow he shall walk in the path of the upanishads\n disregarded insulted deceived envied beaten obstructed or made to suffer by denial of food by wicked people or when faeces and urine are thrown at him by the ignorant and shaken in various ways the ascetic desiring welfare but fallen into difficulties shall raise himself by the power of the self\n honour received by the ascetic brings about great loss to the wealth of his penance yoga but when he is disregarded by ignorant people he attains success in the practice of yoga as he becomes free of ego by the ordeal \n wiyout transgressing right conduct of the good the yogin may so move about that ordinary people may disregard him but they shall never associate with him\n they yogin absorbed in meditation shall do no harm by word yought or physical action to beings such as the womb born the egg born and others\n he shall avoid all associations\n abandoning all defects such as passion and anger as well as pride greed delusion etc\n the mendicant monk shall remain free from fear\n eaten food given as alms observing silence penance meditation specially possessing correct knowledge and dispassion these are considered to be the duties of a mendicant monk\n wearing ochre garment ever devoted to the yoga of meditation he may take shelter for the night at the outskirts of a village the shade of a tree or even in a temple\n he shall always live on alms and nowhere eat food obtained from one house alone\n a wise man before embracing renunciation shall always be on the move till he attains purity of mind there the pure minded shall renounce worldly life and move about here and there\n visualising god the lord vishnu everything both outwardly and inwardly he shall move about at all times silent and free from impurity like the breeze\n equanimous in joy and sorrow patient and forgiving eating what comes to his hand and seeing wiyout enmity equally on the twice born the cow the horse and the deer etc\n meditating on vishnu who is the supreme self and the lord ishana contemplating on the supreme bliss and remembering that he is brahman alone he shall spend the time \n thus having become wise and possessing complete control over the mind turning away from desires unclad by becoming an avadhuta always discarding all worldly affairs by yought word and deed and turning his face away from the illusory phenomenal world the sage becomes liberated from worldly bondage by deep meditation on his self according to the maxim of the wasp and the worm\n thus ends the fifth chapter of the upanishad\n then narada asked of the grandfather brahma lord the sage attains liberation by that practice according to the maxim of the wasp and the worm\n how is that practice accomplished the god brahma said to him true in speech he shall lead the life with his body remaining distinctive by the power of wisdom and dispassion\n wisdom is the wise man s body know that dispassion is his life tranquillity and self restraint his eyes the mind his face intelligence his digit kala consisting of sixteen parts beginning with prana and ending with naman the twenty five elements his limbs the aggregate of the states of waking etc\n his five primary elements of earth water etc\n action devotion wisdom and dispassion are the branches i\n hands in the form of his waking dreaming deep sleep and the fourth state turiya the fourteen organs are of the form of unstable pillars fixed in slime\n none the less as a pilot guides a boat even from a muddy place to safety as a mahout an intractable elephant the man of dispassion shall bring them organs under his control by his discernment and considering everything other than the i i\n the self to be false and transitory he shall always speak of himself as brahman\n there is nothing else for him to know other than his self\n being thus liberated while living jivanmukta he lives as one who has fulfilled himself\n he shall never say i am not brahman but feel incessantly brahman i am in the states of waking dreaming and deep sleep then reaching the turiya state he shall be merged in the state of turiyatita of disembodied final beatitude \n in the fourth state of turiya the day is the waking state the night is the dreaming state and midnight is the state of deep sleep\n in one state there are the four states\n among the fourteen organs each of which has a single function under its control the functions of the eye etc\n will now be described \n by the eye there is the comprehension of form by the ears that of sound by the tongue that of taste by the nose that of smell by speech that of articulate expression by the hand that of seizure by the feet that of movement by the anus that of evacuation by the genitals that of sexual pleasure and by the skin that of touch\n intelligence which comprehends objects is dependent on these described above \n it comprehends by intelligence\n it becomes conscious by the mind chitta \n it becomes conceited by the ego\n having specially created these the individual self jiva becomes as such due to the conscious possession of the body\n the jiva pervades the body as a householder moves in his house conscious of its possession\n having understood the nature of the face of consciousness in the lotus of the heart namely that it experiences goodness in the eastern petal sleep and sloth in the south eastern cruelty in the southern sinfulness in the south western sportiveness in the western inclination to move about in the north western tranquillity in the northern wisdom in the north eastern dispassion in the pericarp and yought of the self in the filaments the sage is left with the consciousness of the turiyatita brahman alone simultaneously with the dawn of that wisdom \n there is in the state of the awareness of life the first of the waking state the second of dreaming the third of deep sleep the fourth of the turiya state and the state beyond the fourth turiyatita when the four states are absent\n the self is one only spoken of as having the different states of vishva taijasa prajna and tatastha the passive state \n there is only one luminous being the witness the one free of all attributes the sage shall speak i\n feel that he is brahman alone \n otherwise there are the four states of waking etc\n in the waking state the four states of dreaming etc\n in the dreaming state the four states of deep sleep etc\n in the state of deep sleep and the four states of turiya etc\n in the turiya state\n not so in the state of turiyatita which is devoid of attributes\n as vishva taijasa prajna and ishvara in the states of the gross subtle and causal bodies the witness remains as one alone in all the states\n is the passive one tatastha the witness the tatastha is the not the witness\n due to being a witness he is not the witness alone\n the jiva is affected by his states of doing enjoying and egoit ism etc\n the one other than the jiva is unaffected by the various states \n if argued that the jiva too is unaffected it is not so\n there is the conscious feeling of the body due to the consciousness of being the jiva and of being a jiva due to the possession of the body\n there is an intervention in the state of the jiva as between the ether in the pot and the all pervading ether\n it is due to this intervention alone that the jiva pretending inhalation and exhalation investigates into the supreme witness by the mantra the hamsa brahman that i am \n thus realizing that there is really no difference between the jiva and the supreme witness one shall abandon conscious feeling of the body thus one becomes free of the consciousness of the body\n such a one alone is said to be brahman\n giving up attachment conquering anger taking a very moderate diet subduing the senses and blocking the gates of the body by his intelligence the ascetic shall direct his mind towards deep meditation\n in solitary places alone in caves and forests the yogin ever in harmony shall always begin well his meditation on the self \n in receptions ceremonies performed in honour of the manes sraddhas and sacrifices in religious processions and festivities and in the assemblies of people the knower of yoga desiring final emancipation shall never be present\n the yogin absorbed in meditation shall so move about that the people disregard and insult him but he shall never swerve from the path of the good\n the three disciplines are restraint in speech restraint in action and perfect control of the mind he who pracit ises these three restraints is the observer of the three disciplines tridandin and is a great sage\n that ascetic is considered as the foremost of all who goes to receive alms from different houses of very learned brahmanas as a bee does for honey when the ritual fire emits no smoke and has burnt itself out\n he is a despicable ascetic who goes for alms continuously wiyout any restraint remains in that order of ascetics wiyout an inward urge and has no dispassion\n he is considered an ascetic and no other who knowing that alms are specially attainable in a particular house does not go there again\n that ascetic is considered as one beyond the castes and orders ativarnashramin who realizes the supreme truth which is free of the body senses etc\n which is the all witness the spiritual wisdom the self of bliss and the self radiant\n castes and orders etc\n pertaining to the body are invented by the bamboozling illusion\n they the castes and orders are never part of my self which is of the form of pure consciousness\n he who realizes thus by the teachings of the upanishads shall be deemed as one beyond the castes and orders\n he whose conduct conforming to castes and orders has dropped out on visualising his self goes beyond all restrictions of castes and orders and remains in the bliss of his self\n the knowers of the truth of all the vedas declare that man to be beyond the castes and orders who is established in his self having reached the stage beyond his order ashrama an his caste varna \n therefore oh narada even the castes and the orders of other people have all been superimposed on the self by delusion of the ordinary people this is not done by the knower of the self\n there is no vedic injunction no prohibition no rule of exclusion or inclusion to those who have realized brahman nor is there anything else restricting their conduct oh narada\n unattached to all beings and even to the attainment of the position of the god brahma and uprooting tenderness towards everything even to his children wealth etc\n the novice full of faith in the path leading to liberation and desiring to acquire the wisdom of the upanishads should approach a guru who has realized brahman with a present in his hand\n pleasing him by rendering personal service attentively for a long time he shall always listen with great attention to his exposition of the truths of the upanishads\n free from mine ness and egoit ism bereft of all attachment and always possessing tranquillity etc\n he visualises the atman in his self\n dispassion always dawns on one only when one sees the defects of worldly life\n to one discontented with the life in the world renunciation will come\n there is no doubt about it\n one truly desiring liberation is called a paramahamsa\n before reaching this state the ascetic shall pracit ise in his life the wisdom of the scripture which is evidently the one means of liberation by listening to the exposition of the upanishads etc\n in order to attain the wisdom of the scripture that results in self realization the sage called the paramahamsa should be equipped with all the means such as tranquillity self restraint etc\n deeply intent on the practice of the wisdom of the upanishads tranquil self restrained conquering the senses fearless free always from mine ness unaffected by the pairs of opposites wiyout dependants or other belongings the ascetic shall be clad in a tattered loincloth and be with shaven head or he may be unclad\n wise proficient in the vedanta pracit ising yoga free from mineness and egoit ism equanimous towards friends etc\n friendly to all beings alone the man of wisdom and the self controlled such an ascetic crosses the ocean of worldly misery and not any other\n as novice he shall be devoted to the welfare of his elders and reside a year there in the abode of the guru \n he shall always be vigilant in the observance of the lesser vows niyamas as well as the great moral duties yamas \n then at the end of the year having attained the excellent yoga of wisdom he shall move about the country in conformity with lit\n wiyout antagonizing right conduct\n thereafter at the end of another year he shall give up even the excellent wisdom of the yajnavalkya and the triad of orders of kutichaka etc\n and reach the state of the paramahamsa\n and bidding farewell to the gurus elders and preceptors he shall indeed move about the country giving up all attachment subduing anger being very moderate in diet and conquering the senses\n these two people do not fare well due to incompatibility in their action the householder not engaging himself in productive work and the mendicant monk busying himself with work\n on seeing a young handsome woman he becomes inflamed with passion and drinking liquor he becomes intoxicated\n therefore he shall avoid from afar a woman who is poison to the eye\n conversing with women as well as chatting with and sending them on errands their dance music and laughter and scandals about them these the ascetic shall avoid\n neither ceremonial ablution nor muttering prayers nor worship of the gods nor offering oblation to gods nor means of accomplishing anything nor fire ritual etc\n is to be pracit ised by him here oh narada\n he has not to do the worshipping of gods offering oblation to the manes going on pilgrimage and the observing of vows he has neither righteous conduct dharma nor unrighteous conduct adharma nor has he any rule of conduct nor worldly action\n the yogin shall give up all worldly duties and those conforming to popular practices in every way\n the wise ascetic the yogin his mind dwelling on the highest truth shall not destroy insects worms moths as well as trees\n with your attention always turned inward pure composed in mind your mind filled with the self discarding inward contact with outward objects may you oh narada move freely in the world\n journeying alone the ascetic shall not move about in an anarchical country\n praising none bowing to no one not uttering svadha as he worships no manes residing in unstable deserted houses and hills the ascetic shall move about wiyout any restraint\n thus ends the sixth chapter of the upanishad\n then asked about the restrictions to the conduct of the ascetic the god brahma said to them in front of narada\n the ascetic being dispassionate shall reside in a fixed abode during the rains and move about for eight months alone he shall not then reside in one place continuously \n the mendicant monk shall not stay in one place like a deer out of fright\n he shall not accept any proposal to prolong his stay which militates against his departure\n he shall not cross a river swimming with his hands\n neither shall he climb a tree for fruits \n he shall not witness the festival in honour of any god\n he shall not subsist on food from one place alone \n he shall not perform external worship of gods\n discarding everything other than the self and subsisting on food secured as alms from a number of houses as a bee gathers honey becoming lean not increasing fat in the body he shall discard the fattening ghee like blood\n he shall consider getting food in one house alone as taking meat anointing himself with fragrant unguent as smearing with an impure thing treacle as an outcaste garment as a plate with leavings of another oil bath as attachment to women delighting with friends as urine desire as beef the place previously known to him as the hut of an outcaste women as snakes gold as deadly poison an assembly hall as a cemetery the capital city as dreadful hell kumbhipaka and food in one house as lumps of flesh of a corpse\n discarding the sight of others as different from himself and also the ways of the world leaving his native place avoiding the places previously known to him recollecting the bliss of the self like the joy of regaining a forgotten object and forgetting the pride in his body and native place admitting that his body is fit to be discarded like a corpse he shall remain far away leaving the place of his children and close relatives as a thief does when released from prison\n subsisting on food secured wiyout effort devoting himself to meditation on brahman and the pranava and freed of all worldly activities having burnt passion anger greed delusion pride envy etc\n and unaffected by the three gunas sattva etc\n free of the six human infirmities hunger thirst etc\n devoid of change due to the six states of beings namely origin existence etc\n true in speech pure not hating any one residing one night in a village five nights in a city five nights in sacred spots five nights in holy places on the banks of sacred rivers wiyout a fixed abode with a steady mind never uttering a falsehood he may reside in mountain caves he shall journey alone but intent on the four months of rest during the rains chaturmashya he may journey in the company of another towards a village and as three or four towards a city\n the rule is that a mendicant monk shall journey alone\n he shall not allow free play to the fourteen organs there\n enjoying the wealth of dispassion brought on by the full knowledge of the transient nature of worldly life firmly resolved in himself that there is no one other than his self and there is no other different from him seeing everywhere his own form and thus attaining liberation while living jivanmukti and conscious of his fourfold self as otir etc\n till the end of the sway of prarabdha karman the ascetic shall live meditating on his self till his body falls\n these are bathing at the three periods sandhyas of the day by the kutichaka ascetic twice by the bahudaka once by the hamsa mental bath by the paramahamsa bath i\n smearing of holy ashes by the turiyatita and air bath by the avadhuta\n the kutichaka should put on the perpendicular mark of sandal on the forehead urdhvapundra the bahudaka the three horizontal lines of holy ashes tripundra the hamsa either the urdhvapundra or the tripundra the paramahamsa the smearing of holy ashes the turiyatita the mark of sandal tilakapundra the avadhuta none at all or the turiyatita and the avadhuta have none at all \n the kutichaka shall have a shave in each of the six seasons the bahudaka a shave at the end of two seasons the paramahamsa no shave or if there is a shave in six months at the time of the solstice ayana and no shave to the turiyatita and the avadhuta\n the kutichaka takes food in one house the bahudaka collects alms from door to door as a bee does honey the hamsa and the paramahamsa use the hand as the vessel i\n begging bowl the turiyatita is cow mouthed i\n food is placed in his mouth and the avadhuta takes food at random as does a python \n the kutichaka wears two garments the bahudaka one garment the hamsa a piece of cloth the paramahamsa is either unclad or wears a single loin cloth the turiyatita and the avadhuta are unclad lit\n they remain as at the time of birth \n the hamsa and the paramahamsa wear a deer skin not the others\n the kutichaka and the bahudaka pracit ise worship of gods the hamsa and the paramahamsa worship mentally the turiyatita and the avadhuta feel that i am i\n they identify the individual soul with the supreme spirit the kutichaka and the bahudaka have the right to recite mantras the hamsa and the paramahamsa to meditate on them the turiyatita and the avadhuta have no right for either of the two practices but the turiyatita and the avadhuta have the right to give instruction on the great vedantic texts so also the paramahamsa\n the kutichaka the bahudaka and the hamsa have no right to give instruction to others\n the kutichaka and the bahudaka are to meditate on the pranava of men the external pranava consisting of four mantras the hamsa and the paramahamsa on the antarapranava consisting of eight mantras the turiyatita and the avadhuta on brahmaapranava consisting of sixteen matras \n the kutichaka and the bahudaka shall listen to the exposition of the vedanta the hamsa and the paramahamsa reflect on them the turiyatita and the avadhuta have profound and repeated meditation on them\n the rule is that all these ascetics shall meditate on the self\n thus the aspirant after liberation always remembering the liberating mantra om which enables him to cross the ocean of worldly life shall live liberated while living the ascetic shall seek the means to attain final beatitude kaivalya according to the rules of the special order of the ascetic in which he finds himself \n thus ends the seventh chapter of the upanishad\n then narada asked the god brahma be pleased to expound the saviour mantra for ending the course of worldly life \n agreeing to it the god brahma commenced to expound it\n the om is brahman in the mode of viewing it as made up of many separate bodies vyashti and as made up of parts each of which is cosubstantially the same with the whole samashti \n which is the vyashti which is the samashti the samhara pranava and srishti pranava are of three kinds the inner pranava antahpranava the outer pranava bahya pranava and the combined inner and outer pranava ubhayatmaka pranava \n the one brahma pranava is sometimes the inner pranava consisting of eight matras and the practical pranava vyaharika pranava \n the outer pranava and the pranava of the sages arsha pranava \n the combined inner and outer pranava is the virat pranava\n the samharapranava the brahma pranava and the ardhamatra pranava\n thus the brahma pranava is of eight kinds samhara pranava srishti pranava antah pranava bahya pranava vyavaharika pranava arsapranava virat pranava and ardhamatra pranava \n the om is brahman\n know that the om consisting of one syllable is the antah pranava\n it is divided into eight matras the vowel a the vowel u the consonant m the half syllable ardhamatra the nada the bindu the kala and the shakti\n hence it is not four as its chief matras have been said to be \n the vowel a consists of ten yousand parts the vowel u is of a yousand parts the letter m of a hundred parts and the ardhamatra pranava consists of an endless number of parts\n the viratpranava is possessed of attributes saguna and the samhara pranava is free of attributes nirguna the utpatti pranava consists of both saguna and nirguna \n the virat pranava is prolated pluta \n the samhara pranava is pluta pluta\n the virat pranava consists of sixteen matras and is beyond the thirty six primary substances\n how has it sixteen matras\n they are enumerated the vowel a is the first the vowel u is the second the letter m is the third the ardhamatra is the fourth the bindu is the fifth the nada the sixth the kala the seventh the kalatita the eighth shanti the ninth the santyatita the tenth the unmani the eleventh the manonmani the twelfth the puri the thirteenth the madhyama the fourteenth the pashyanti the fifteenth and the para the sixteenth\n again the brahma pranava yough only one attains the state of possessing or not possessing attributes saguna and nirguna having attained the state of possessing matras due to the twofold character of prakriti and purusha when it has sixty four matras each\n this brahma pranava is the prop of all the supreme effulgence and the lord of all thus the sages with true vision look upon it\n it consists of all gods and the prop of all universe the lord is in it\n it consists of all the syllables it is the time it is composed of all the scripture and is the auspicious one shiva \n it is the most excellent of all the vedas and consists of the essence of all the upanishads this om the atman should be sought\n past present and future constitute the three periods the indestructible syllable om pervades and transcends these know that it is the beginning of everything and the bestower of final beatitude\n the same om which is the atman has been described by the word brahman\n similarly experiencing it as the one wiyout a second the ageless the immortal the om and super imposing the om along with the body on brahman it becomes one with it\n know it for certain then that the triplebodied atman is the supreme brahman\n one should deeply meditate on the supreme brahman in the due order of vishva etc\n the vishva the viraj the otir and the turya \n this atman is fourfold as experiencing the gross aspect as the vishva when it is an individual in the gross aspect as enjoying the world in the dreaming state in a subtle form when it has assumed the subtle form of the taijasa as enjoying bliss in the state of identity of the prajna and the ishvara and as enjoying bliss in the turya state \n the atman is of four padas quarters \n the vishva consisting of four stages vishva vishva vishva taijasa vishva prajna and vishva turya is the purusha vaishvanara\n it functions in the waking state\n it perceives gross forms of the phenomenal world and experiences them\n it possesses nineteen faces the five organs of perception the five organs of action the five vital airs and the four inner senses of manas buddhi ahamkara and chitta has eight limbs the sky as the head the sun and the moon the two eyes the directions the ears the sea the lower part of the abdomen the earth the feet moves everywhere and is the master prabhu \n this vishva jit is the first pada of the atman \n the vishva the vishvapada of the atman has four aspects in the four states of waking dreaming deep sleep and the turya\n in the waking state it functions through the senses and experiences the sight etc\n this is the waking within the waking state jagrat jagrana \n its experiencer in the individual aspect is the vishva vishva the vishva subdivision of the vishvapada of the atman it is virat viraj in the collective aspect\n it is otir otir in the individual and collective aspects\n when the mind grasps objects wiyout the functioning of the senses it is dreaming within the waking state jagratsvapna its experiencer is vishva taijasa the taijasa subdivision of the vishva \n when one is not conscious of anything but remains as if unconscious then it is sleep within the waking state jagratsusupti its experiencer is the vishva prajna the prajna subdivision of the vishva \n when one is in equanimity due to the grace of the guru or the fruition of one s good deeds punya as if one were in samadhi and behaves like an onlooker sakshin it is the turya in the waking state jagrat turya \n its experiencer is the vishva turya the turya subdivision of the vishva \n the second pada of the atman the taijasa too has four aspects the taijasa vishva the taijasataijasa the taijasa prajna and the taijasa turya and is the lord of beings the hiranyagarbha\n it functions as the master in the dreaming state\n it perceives subtle forms of the phenomenal world and experiences them\n though possessing eight limbs it is one and not different oh narada lit\n the tormentor of foes \n when in the dreaming state the atman experiences the sight etc\n of objects with dreameyes etc\n wiyout the active functioning of the mind then there is the waking within the dreaming state svapna jagarana and its experiencer is the taijasa vishva the vishva subdivision of the taijasa \n its experiencer is the sutra viraj in the collective aspect of the experiences of the svapna jagarana state it is the otir subdivision of the anujnatir in the individual and collective aspects\n when in the dreaming state the atman enjoys the objects by the mind alone wiyout the functioning of the dream eyes etc\n and the svapna jagarana state it is the state of svapna svapna dreaming within the dreaming state \n its experiencer is the taijasa taijasa the taijasa subdivision of the taijasa pada of the atman \n when there is no experience of the svapna jagarana and the svapna svapna states and there is no perception either by the dream eyes etc\n or by the mind and there is a total forgetfulness of external objects and of oneself that state of insensibility is the svapna susupti the state of deep sleep within the dreaming state \n the atman who experiences this state is the taijasa prajna the prajna subdivision of the taijasa pada of the atman \n when due to the fruition of one s good deeds there are no perceptions of the three previous states of the dreaming state and the atman remains in the turya state of the dreaming state when there shines a neutral state the state of a witness of generic and particular experiences of the external world and of the inner senses that state is svapna turya the turya subdivision of dreaming state and the atman who experiences this is the taijasa turya the turya subdivision of the taijasa pada of the fourfold atman \n when one is asleep and neither hankers after desire nor sees any dream that is clearly deep sleep\n in this state functions the four fold prajna as prajna vishva prajna taijasa prajna prajna and prajnaturya which is termed the third pada of the atman\n this atman is one remains in the state of deep sleep possesses the fullness of wisdom enjoys happiness consists of everlasting bliss and remains in the heart of all beings yet he enjoys bliss has the mind for his face is omnipresent and indestructible and is the ishvara\n he is the lord of all omniscient and subtle in conception\n he permeates all beings he is the prime source the origin and the destruction of all\n all these three stages of waking dreaming and deep sleep are a hindrance to the annihilation of all activities to beings i\n for self realization hence they are akin to the state of deep sleep it is really dream stuff and has been said to be an illusion alone\n in the state of deep sleep when the person remaining in either of the two states of waking or dreaming desires to move to the state of deep sleep and experiences the false notion of form etc\n of objects with the eyes etc\n then it is the state of waking within deep sleep susupti jagrat its experiencer in the individual aspect is the vishva subdivision of the prajna in its collective aspect it is the viraj subdivision of the bijatman in the combined individual and collective aspect it is the anujnaikarasotir\n in the state of deep sleep when the atman is free of the false notion of form etc\n of external objects and occupying a position in either of the waking or dreaming states experiences the false notions of form etc\n of objects it is the state of dreaming with in deep sleep svapna svapna \n the experiencing atman then is the prajna taijasa the taijasa subdivision of the prajna \n again in deep sleep when the atman yough experiencing the false notion of form etc\n of objects with the false activities of seeing etc\n which pervade one s consciousness chaitanya is yet not experiencing them as if stagnant then it is the state of deep sleep within deep sleep\n the experiencing atman then is the prajna prajna the prajna subdivision immanent in the prajna \n again in the state of deep sleep when the atman enjoys bliss remaining as the witness of the experiences of the three previous stages in deep sleep then it is the turya state of deep sleep and the experiencing atman is the prajna turya the turya subdivision of the prajna \n the fourth pada the turya yough fourfold as turya vishva turya taijasa turyaprajna and turya turya is indeed the one essence of pure consciousness for the reason that each one of these vishva etc\n culminates in the turya state\n the turya state forms the basis for the differentiation of the atman as otir anujnatir and anujnana i\n these three different states are really susupta as they merely constitute a veil of the turya turya which is supreme bliss and consists of an inward dream stuff\n knowing that anything other than the turyaturya is mere illusion there remains the next moment the one essence of pure consciousness\n as the turya turya being the one state of bliss is incapable of subdivisions in the individual collective and partly individual and partly collective aspects the turya by itself is not of a fourfold nature but only three excluding the turya turya \n this threefold nature of the turya may be explained thus as there are distinctions in external objects the knower of brahman perceives them with his senses but wiyout distinction this state is the turya jagarana the atman who experiences this state individually is the turya vishva collectively it is the turya viraj partly individual partly collective it is the avikalpa otir\n when the knower of brahman with all sense activities abated perceives the oneness of the self with brahman by his mind alone it is the state of turya svapna the atman who experiences this is the turya taijasa\n when the person is in distinctionless deep meditation nirvikalpa samadhi and remains as if in a state of suspended animation it is the state of turya susupti and the experiencing atman is the turya prajna\n here is the distinct precept that the turya turya is not at any time gross wisdom as it is not the otrotir which is the same as vishva vishva and the viraj viraj experiencing the jagrat jagarana state nor indeed the subtle sentience as it is different from the taijasa sutra and anujnatir of the svapnajagarana state nor pure consciousness prajna as it is different from the otir avikalpa the same as the vishva the viraj and the turya of the form of consciousness disclosing the presence or absence of the jagrat jagarana and other states nor anywhere else oh sage\n it is not non consciousness aprajna as it is far away from the anujnatir otir identical with the taijasa vishva and the sutra viraj that are wiyout outward perception in the svapna jagarana state nor of both gross and subtle consciousness as it is outside the scope of otir anujnaikarasa identified with the vishva prajna and the viraj bija of the jagrat svapna state which is outside the province of true knowledge nor exclusive intelligence as it is not within the scope of anujnatiranujnaikarasa identified with the taijasa prajna and the sutra bija of the form of exclusive intelligence functioning in the svapna svapna state and is never perceptible as it is beyond the range of the anujnatir anujnatir identified with the taijasa taijasa and the sutra sutra deluded by the vision created by the mind in the svapna svapna state \n it cannot be defined as it is different from the anujnaikarasa anujnatir identified with the prajna taijasa and the bija sutra which can be known only through the ignorance of the atman in the svapna svapna state cannot be grasped as it is different from the anujnaikarasa otir identified with the prajna vishva and the bija viraj which can be grasped through the ignorance of the atman in the svapna jagarana state is incapable of being expressed as it is different from the anujnatir avikalpa identified with the taijasa sutra turiya which manifests the presence or absence of the svapnajagarana and other states in the svapna turya state is beyond yought as it is outside the anujnaikarasa anujnaikarasa identified with the prajna prajna and the bija bija in the svapa svapa state having only the recollection i know not anything of that state is incapable of being given a name as it is untouched by the perception of the anujnaikarasa avikalpa identified with the prajnabija turya that could be named as the witness of the presence or absence of the svapna jagarana and similar states in the svapna turya state is also the essence of the conviction in the one atman as it is different from the perceptions of the avikalpa otir identified with the turya vishva viraj experiencing the turya jagarana state is the annihilation of worldly life as it cannot bear even the smell of the avikalpa anujnatir identified with the turya taijasa sutra which in some cases does not put an end to worldly life and which experiences the turya svapna state is quiescent as it differs from the experience of the avikalpa anujnaikarasa identified with the turya prajna bija experiencing the turya svapna state is the auspicious one as it is the same as final beatitude kaivalya in the disembodied state and is the non dual one as it is of the form of the supreme non dual state wiyout a counter part this the knowers of brahman consider as the fourth the turya turya it is the same as the brahma pranava\n this should be realized and not any other called turya\n this turya turya is the prop to the seekers after liberation as the sun to the phenomenal world it is self effulgent as it is the source of lustre to the sun etc\n it is the ether of brahman as it is wiyout a counter part it always shines as it is the transcendent brahman\n thus ends the eighth chapter of the upanishad\n then narada inquired how is the real form of brahman the god brahma answered expounding the real form of brahman\n those who consider that he the transcendent brahman is one and himself the individual self as another are beasts yough not beasts in their true nature\n the wise sage having realized thus that the individual self and brahman are identical is released from the jaws of death i\n belief in duality results in death and renunciation birth that in non duality in immortality \n there is no other path known to reach the goal of final beatitude \n time is the root cause of worldly life say some philosophers nature say the mimamsakas chance say the atheists the five elements say the jainas who believe in the eternality of the world matter prakriti say the saktas the purusha hiranyagarbha say the yogins thus the speculation on the cause of worldly life \n the combination of these is not the cause on account of the existence of the self\n the self too is incapable of being the cause on account of its being subject to happiness and misery\n they the knowers of brahman resorting to the yoga of deep meditation perceived the power maya of the self luminous atman well hidden by its own attributes of sattva etc\n who alone governs all these causes including time and the individual self\n maya under the guidance of the saguna brahman ishvara created the universe\n brahman itself does not perform any action as it is nishkriya \n they perceived that world resembling the wheel of a chariot in one felly maya covered with three the gods brahma vishnu and shiva possessing the power of creation sustenance and withdrawal of the world due to the association with the three gunas possessing sixteen powers kalas having fifty spokes with twenty nails in the form of the senses and their objects having six groups of eight astakas with one fetter desire of many forms with three kinds of paths and having delusion which is the cause of the two goodness and sin based on love and hatred \n we think of that river the water of which flows in five ways currents which has five fierce mouths due to five causes the waves of which are the five vital airs whose source is the ego which controls the five senses of perception which has five whirlpools whose speed of flow consists of the five miseries which has fifty divisions and which has five junctures\n in this wheel of brahman which is the cause of the life of all the substratum of the dissolution of all and extensive far vaster than the sky the hamsa the paramatman in the form of the individual self is revolved\n having considered himself as separate as the individual self as the ether in the pot with reference to the all pervading ether and brahman as the controlling self he is revolved in the wheel of worldly life and then becoming beloved by him on realizing the truth in thou art that and i am brahman the individual soul attains immortality\n this described before as different from the saguna brahman or ishvara has indeed been sung in the upanishads as the supreme brahman on him the essence of the pranava the triad is superimposed and it is the support of the phenomenal world which is in itself it is imperishable\n knowers of the veda realizing the difference between the self and brahman to be false and being completely devoted to him are absorbed in the transcendent brahman\n the lord sustains the universe unified by cause and effect the perishable phenomenal world and the imperishable maya the manifested nature and the unmanifested cause maya \n the individual atman is considered to be powerless due to its nature of being an experiencer of pleasure and pain having realized the self effulgent being he becomes free of all bonds\n the omniscient and the ignorant are the two uncreated beings the former is the lord and the other the powerless anisha there is indeed the one uncreated prakriti which is intended for the things of experience and the experiencer the transcendent atman is unlimited and omnipresent and is not an agent of actions \n when one realizes these three ishvara the individual self and prakriti to be brahman one becomes brahman \n prakriti pradhana is perishable the lord hara who dispels ignorance is immortal and imperishable\n the one self effulgent being rules over the perishable prakriti and the individual atman\n by repeated deep meditation on him and concentration of the mind in yoga i am he and by the realization of true reality there shall be the disappearance of the universal illusion maya at the end of one s ignorance \n having realized the self effulgent lord as identical with the self one is released from all bonds with all miseries destroyed there will be an end to births and deaths\n by deeply meditating on that that he is no other than that reality and when the difference between the body and the self has disappeared the sage realizes the third supreme state of the parameshvara and therein final beatitude kevala and thus has fulfilled himself\n this brahman should be realized as oneself it is everlasting and present as the individual atman for there is nothing other than that that is woryour of realization\n having considered with illusory vision the experiencer individual atman the objective world of experience and the ishvara ruler as different know that all this triad has been well declared by the knowers of the vedanta to be brahman alone \n the means of realizing this brahman is the brahma vidya the teaching of the upanishads and penance i\n deep meditation it is solely dependent on the upanishads for its realization \n to one who thus understands and meditates on one s self alone what delusion is there what sorrow to one who beholds oneness hence the separateness of viraj the past the present and the future disappears and they become of the form of the indestructible brahman \n subtler than the atom greater than the great the self is situated in the heart of this every creature\n one sees this transcendent lord who is free from passions by the grace of the creator and thus becomes freed from sorrow\n having no hands and feet the lord moves fast and grasps objects wiyout eyes he sees wiyout ears he hears\n he knows things to be known wiyout a mind as he is omniscient no one knows him\n knowers of the vedanta speak of him as the foremost transcendental purusha the supreme consciousness \n the wise yogin does not feel sorrow having realized the atman who is bodiless transcendent and all pervading and who is present in all bodies which are impermanent\n this transcendent being the prop of all as vishnu whose powers are beyond the reach of yought who is to be realized by the esoteric meaning of all the upanishads and who is greater than the indestructible great ought to be realized at the end of everything phenomenal the emancipator lit\n the harbinger of death to avidya ought to be known\n the all wise the most ancient the most exalted of sentient beings the lord of all the one adored by all gods and devoid of beginning middle and end the infinite the indestructible and the prop lit\n the mountain to the gods shiva vishnu and brahma should be realized \n all this universe made up of the five elements and remaining in the five which becomes endless in variety by their quintuplication is pervaded by him the atman as antaryamin etc\n but it is unencompassable by the parts thus quintuplicated for it is the highest of the high and greater than the great and eternal auspiciousness by the effulgence of its own form\n thus the seeker after liberation should realize the self as brahman \n neither one who has not refrained from bad conduct nor one who is not peaceful nor one wiyout concentrated meditation nor one whose mind is not quiescent can realize him brahman by mere knowledge of the scripture \n by the one gaining true knowledge prajnana by refraining from the evils described above realizes brahman \n the self remaining in oneself reveals itself neither to one who considers it as inwardly wise nor as outwardly wise nor as gross nor as subtle nor as knowledge nor as ignorance nor as knowledge of both external and internal nor as conceivable nor as directly connected with worldly activities\n he who realizes it thus becomes liberated he becomes liberated\n thus said the god brahma\n the mendicant monk is a knower of the real nature of the self\n the mendicant monk journeys alone as duality is foreign to him even in a crowd \n like a deer timid through fear he remains wiyout mixing with company \n he does not stand in the way of others progress \n discarding everything other than his bare body sustaining his life in the manner of a bee by collecting food from different places and deeply meditating on his self and wiyout seeing any difference in all things from his own self he becomes liberated\n this mendicant monk abstaining from being the agent of all worldly actions freed from duties of the preceptor disciple scripture etc\n and discarding all bands of the phenomenal world is untouched by delusions\n how can the mendicant monk devoid of wealth be happy he is rich as he has the wealth of brahman beyond both knowledge and ignorance beyond pleasure and pain illumined by self effulgence celebrated among all people omniscient the giver of all great powers the lord of all thus he considers himself\n that is the highest place of lord vishnu where the yogins having reached it never return therefrom \n the sun shines not there nor does the moon\n he never again returns to worldly life he never returns\n that is final beatitude kaivalya \n thus ends the upanishad\n end of the ninth chapter and the upanishad \n om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye

    "Trisikhi": "om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me a brahmin called trishiki brahmana went to the land of sun god and asked him oh god what is body what is soul what is the cause and what is athma the sun god replied you have to realize that all this is shiva\n because only shiva is ever clean who is devoid of any blemishes and who is everywhere and for whom there is no second\n he is the only one who creates everything by his light and similar to the fire appearing in different forms on different pieces of steel he appears in different forms\n if you ask to what he gives light the answer would be brahmam which is denoted by the word sath and which is merged with ignorance and illusion\n that brhamam gave rise to that which is not clear \n that which is not clear gave rise to mahat great \n mahat gave rise to egoism\n egoism gave rise to five thanmathras \n that five thanmathras gave rise to five bhoothas viz earth water fire air and ether\n ether is consciousness viz mind wisdom self will and egoism \n air is samana udhana vyana apana and prana which are the airs in the body\n fire is ears skin eyes tongue and nose\n the concept of water is feelings of sound touch view taste and smell\n earth is words hands legs and other physical organs\n ether which is the concept of wisdom is decision behavior and self esteem\n the actions related to air are uniting changing of places taking hearing and breathing\n the actions related to fire are the feeling of touch sight taste view and sound\n these also depend on water\n the actions related to earth are talking giving taking going and coming\n the actions of the prana thanmathra symbolic soul are the organs for doing work and organs for earning wisdom\n egoism is limited to mind brain and the will to do\n the micro aspects of the symbolic soul prana thanmathra are giving place scattering seeing uniting and being firm\n these twelve are the aspects of philosophy early concept of godliness and early concept of physical existence\n chandra brahma directions air sun varuna aswini devas divine doctors fire indra king of devas upendra prajapathi and yama god of death are the gods of the organs and senses who travel like soul in these twelve aspects\n slokas are not available\n from there earth came in to existence embracing one thing with the other pervading by criss cross connections step by step as the result of pancha boothas five aspects of earth air water fire and ether gained life\n in that earth plants climbers food and four types of pindas body centers arose\n the root sections of the body are taste blood flesh fat bones nerves and semen\n some pindas arose because of their own interaction and some pindas arose because of the interaction of pancha boothas\n in this that pinda called anna mayam area of food is in the area of the belly\n in the middle of this body is the heart which is like the lotus flower with its stalk\n the gods for management egoism and action are in there\n the seed for this is the thamo guna baser qualities pinda which is passion oriented and solidified does not move or change \n this is the world with its varied nature and is situated in the neck\n the inside looking happy athma soul is on the summit of the head and is situated in the parama patha place\n this is in its earth like form and shines with great strength\n the state of awakening is every where\n the state of dream is also is there in the state of wakefulness\n the state of sleep and the state of higher knowledge thuriya is not there in other states\n similar to the tastes pervading in all parts of a good fruit shiva shakthi pervades every where\n similarly all kosas area of the body are within annamaya kosa\n similar to the kosam is the soul\n similar to the soul is shiva\n the living being is one with feelings\n shiva is one wiyout feelings\n the kosas are the places of feelings of living being\n and they give rise to states of existence\n similar to the fact that churning of water produces ripples and foam by churning of mind several painful youghts are produced\n by performing duties the living being becomes the slave to those duties\n by forsaking them he attains peace\n he becomes one who sees the world in southern path\n the living being with egoism and self esteem is indeed sadashiva\n the living being attains that type of illusion because of his company with the ignorant soul\n he attains hundreds of yonis female reproductive organ and stays there because of familiarity\n like a fish traveling in between the banks of a river he keeps on traveling till he attains salvation\n over passage of time due to the wisdom of the knowledge of the soul he turns on the northern path and step by step goes up\n when he is able to send his soul power to his head and does permanent practice of yoga he gets wisdom\n because of wisdom his yoga acts\n once yoga and wisdom become stable in him he becomes a yogi\n he will never be destroyed\n he would see lord shiva in his deficiencies and will not see deficiencies in lord shiva\n to get results of yoga it has to be done wiyout any other yought\n wiyout practice you will not succeed in yoga or wisdom\n the yogi will not get the results out of these also\n so by practice of yoga mind and soul should be controlled\n the yogi should cut off the problems in yoga similar to the cutting of material with a sharp knife\n slokas to are not available\n with pure knowledge of athma soul the sensory organs should be controlled\n we should always meditate on para vasudeva who is the greatest soul\n kaivalya salvation is attained by the selected and sorted form of meditation on shape and form\n if a yogi is able to meditate at least for a small time on vasudeva while he is in the kumbhaka stage of pranayama the sins that he has done in seven births will be destroyed\n you have to understand that the portion from belly to the heart is the wakeful action\n in the neck there exists the action of the dream\n in between the jaws exists the sleep\n thuriya exists in between the eyelids\n that action of synthesis with parabrahmaam which is much above thuriya exists in the skull top middle called brahmarandra\n there in the foremost thuriya corner of thuriya the soul is called vishnu\n when one meditates in the very pure paramakasa great ether he should meditate on that adhokshaja who shines for ever with the light of crores of suns as sitting in the lotus of his own heart\n otherwise he has to meditate on that viswa roopi one who is of the form of universe who has several forms several faces several planks with several armaments several eyes which shine like crores of suns several colours and who is peaceful and also very angry\n all the mental preoccupations of a yogi who meditates in such a manner will be completely calmed down\n that yogi who meditates on that indestructible matter which shines like god s grace in the center of the heart on that ultimate truth which is beyond thuriya on that sun who is the form of wisdom which is immeasurable and unending on that being who is like a shining lamp in a windless place and on that being who is like the shine of unprocessed gems would have salvation in his grip\n to that yogi who is able to see and experience the shine of that deva with the universal macro or micro form or atleast a small portion of him in his lotus like heart all the occult powers like anima would be very much within his reach\n one has to understand that the realization of the universal truth of the unity of jeevathma soul and paramathma god which is that i am brhamam and brahmam is me is he real state of samadhi an enlightened state of meditation where all the yought process are unified with god \n that man becomes brahmam and he does not take another birth\n the one who examines such principles with detachment becomes like a fire wiyout wood and becomes one with himself\n since his mind and soul does not have anything to catch hold of get attached he becomes stable in the form of wisdom and his soul melts like a piece of salt and he merges in to the sea of pure consciousness\n he sees the word which is a thing of passion and magic like a dream\n in the natural state that yogi stands wiyout changing as him to himself and attains the nude form in his sleep and attains salvation\n om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the

times\n this mantra which is called ajapa gayatri would give salvation to all yogis\n just a yought of this mantra would help one get rid of all sins\n there are no practices as holy as this no chanting which is equivalent to this and no wisdom equivalent to this and in future also this is not likely to be there\n this ajapa gayatri which rises from the kundalani supports the soul\n this is the greatest among the sciences of the soul\n he who knows this will know the vedas\n the kundalani power which is above the mooladhara in its eight studded form would always be covering the mouth of sushumna which is the gate of brahman\n the kudalani parameshwari goddess of the universe who should go through the disease less gate of brahma closes this gate with her mouth and sleeps\n because of the heat generated by the practice of yoga because of the speed of wind and because of her mental power she stands up and using her needle shaped body she would go up through the sushumna nadi\n similar to opening the doors of the house by using the key the yogi should open the gate to salvation using kundalini\n slokas are not available\n para brahman is om is that which exists which is clean which is full of wisdom which does not have any draw backs which is wiyout stains which cannot be described which does not have beginning or end which is one and only one which is thuriya which exists in things of past present and future and which will never get divided at any time\n from that para brahman emerges para shakthi the female aspect \n that is the soul which is self resplendent\n from that soul arose the ether\n from ether arose wind\n from wind arose fire\n from fire arose water and from water arose the earth\n these five elements are ruled by the five godheads viz\n sadasiva easwara rudra vishnu and brahma\n among them brahma vishnu and rudra would do the job of creation upkeep and destruction\n brahma is rajasic vishnu sathvic and rudra thamasic\n they are thus with three different properties\n among devas brahma arose first\n among those who arose first brahma became the creator vishnu the one who upkeeps and lord rudra the destroyer\n among them from brahma arose worlds devas men and those in between them\n from him arose those things which do not move\n in case of men the body is the unified form of pancha boothas five elements \n the organs of wisdom jnanendriyas the organs of action karmendriyas those activities related to wisdom the five body airs prana apana etc are taught by the macro portion of mind intellect decision making power and the feeling of self and are called macro body sthoola sareeram \n the organs of wisdom the organs of action things related to wisdom the five body airs and the micro aspect of mind and intellect are called linga sareera\n the body has three types of properties\n thus all people have three bodies\n there are four states of the body viz wakeful state dream sleep and thuriya exalted spiritual state \n those purushas who reside in our body and control these states are viswa thaijasa pragna and atma\n viswa will always have macro experiences\n different from that is thaijasa who has micro experiences\n pragna has pleasant experiences\n athma is a witness to all these\n the atma which is of the form of om will be in all beings and at the time of passion downward looking\n at all other times it would be pretty and downward face\n in the three letters aa uu and ma three vedas three worlds three characteristics three letters and three sounds shine\n when you are awake the letter aa exists in the eyes of all beings when you are dreaming the letter uu exists in the neck of all beings and the letter ma exists in the heart of all beings when they are asleep\n the letter aa exists in the egg state as viswa and pinda state as virat purusha\n the letter uu exists as thaijasa and hiranya garbha in the micro state\n the letter ma exists as the causal state and as pragna\n the letter aa has rajasa qualities is red and its form is that of lord brahma\n the letter uu has sathvika qualities and its form is that of white vishnu\n the letter ma has thamasic qualities and its form is that of black rudra\n brahma took birth from pranava\n vishnu also came out of it\n rudra also came out of it\n pranava is the para brahma ultimate god \n brahma merges with the letter aa\n vishnu merges with letter uu and rudra merges with the letter ma\n in people with wisdom pranava would be upward looking and among ignorant people pranava would be looking downward\n pranava exists like this\n the one who knows this knows the vedas\n in the anahatha sound form it grows upwards in case of wise people\n the sound pranava is continuous like the flow of oil and like the long sound of the bell\n its peak is brahman\n that peak would be lit so brilliantly that it cannot be described by words\n the great savants find it out using their sharp intellect\n the one who knows that is considered as one who knows vedas\n the hamsa swan mantra shines in the middle of the two eyes\n the letter sa is known as kechari which means that which travels in the sky \n it has been decided that it is the word twam you in the famous vedic saying tat tvam asi you are that \n it has been decided that the letter ha which is the lord of all universe is the word tat that in the above vedic saying\n we have to meditate that the letter sa as the soul traveling between birth and death and the letter ha as the stable god\n the living being is tied up by his organs but paramatma is not so tied\n the living being is egoistic and the soul is not tied by egoism and is independent\n the ethereal light which is om is that athma in whose aspects stand the three worlds bhu bhuva and suva and also the place where three gods moon sun and fire reside\n the ethereal light which is om is that atma in whose aspects stand work which is the power of brahma desire which is the power of rudra and wisdom which is the power of vishnu\n because om is the ethereal light it has to be pronounced by words practiced by the body and meditated upon by the mind\n the one who goes on chanting pranava whether he is clean or unclean will not be attached to the sins he does similar to the lotus leaf which never gets wet\n slokas are not available\n twelve repetitions of om which is called is a pooraka followed by sixteen repetitions of om which is called is the kumbhaka and then ten repetitions of om which is called rechaka is called pranayama\n the basic rule for chanting pranayama is at least times and is termed as poor twice that amount is medium and thrice that is uthama best \n in the lowest there would be sweating in the medium there would be trembling and in uthama there is attainment of the objective\n after that control the breath\n the yogi should first salute his teacher and lord shiva and sit in the lotus posture concentrate his sight on the edge of the nose and practice pranayama alone\n slokas are not available\n by posture one avoids diseases by pranayama one avoids sins and by pratyahara see below for explanation he controls his mental activity\n by beliefs the mind becomes strong and samadhi gives the being wonderful knowledge and he attains salvation after destroying sinful and holy actions\n slokas are not available\n after seeing the param jyothi which is spread everywhere in samadhi duties and action neither come nor goes\n slokas are not available\n if we stand together with pranayama all diseases would be destroyed\n all diseases appear only to those who are not able to do pranayama\n slokas are not available\n pratyahara is the state where sensory organs like the eye do not concern themselves with things outside but turn themselves inwards\n similar to the sun taking his rays inwards at the third period of dusk the yogi who is in the third stage would control his mind\n om let my limbs and speech prana eyes ears vitality and all the senses grow in strength\n all existence is the brahman of the upanishads\n may i never deny brahman nor brahman deny me\n let there be no denial at all let there be no denial at least from me\n may the virtues that are proclaimed in the upanishads be in me who am devoted to the atman may they reside in me\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the yoga chudamani upanishad included in the sama veda",

consonance with the realization of the oneness of the self and brahman hamsa \n they demonstrate to disciples by their conduct that brahman is present in all beings\n true conviction is their patched garment\n non alignment is their loin cloth\n reflection of the truths of the vedanta is their emblematic staff\n the vision of brahman as non different from the self is their yoga cloth\n sandals consist in avoiding contact with worldly wealth\n activity for bare living at the behest of others\n their bondage is only in the desire to direct the kundalini into the susumna \n liberated while alive as they are freed from denial of the highest brahman \n the oneness with siva is their sleep\n true knowledge by denying joy in avidya or the khechari mudra is their supreme bliss\n the bliss of brahman is free from the three qualities sattva rajas and tamas \n brahman is realized by discrimination of the real from the unreal and it is beyond the reach of the mind and speech\n the phenomenal world is impermanent as it is produced from brahman which alone is real it is similar to a world seen in a dream and an elephant in the sky i\n illusory similarly the cluster of things such as the body is perceived by a network of a multitude of delusions and it is fancied to exist as a serpent in a rope due to imperfect knowledge \n the worship of gods named vishnu brahma and a hundred others culminates in brahman \n the goad is the path\n the path is not void only conventional\n the strength of the supreme lord is the support to the aerial path \n the yoga accomplished by truth is the monastery\n the position heaven of gods does not constitute its real nature\n the prime source brahman is self realization\n the ascetic shall meditate on the absence of distinction based on the gayatri through the ajapa mantra\n restraint on the mind is the patched garment\n by yoga there is the vision experience of the nature of everlasting bliss\n bliss is the alms that he enjoys\n residence even in the great cemetery is as in a pleasure garden\n a solitary place is the monastery\n complete quiescence of the mind is the practice of brahmavidya\n his movement is to unmani state\n his pure body is the propless seat of dignity\n his activity is the bliss of the waves of immortality\n the ether of consciousness is the great established conclusion\n instruction in the emancipating mantra results in efficiency of bodily limbs and mind for possessing divine power in pracit ising tranquillity self restraint etc\n and in the realization of the oneness of the so called higher and lower self\n the presiding deity of the taraka is the everlasting bliss of non duality\n the voluntary religious observance is the restraint of the inner senses\n renouncing tyaga is the giving up of fear delusion sorrow and anger\n renouncing results is the enjoyment of bliss in the identity of the higher and lower self \n unrestrainedness is pure power\n when the reality of brahman shines in the self there is the annihilation of the phenomenal world which is enveloped by the power of shiva maya similarly the burning of the existence or nonexistence of the aggregate of the causal subtle and gross bodies\n he realizes brahman as the prop of the ether\n the auspicious fourth state is the sacred thread the tuft too consists of that\n to him the created world consists of consciousness so also the immovable and the group of various beings\n uprooting the effect of karman is mere talk in the cemetery self brahman illusion mineness and ego have been burnt\n the realized parivrajaka has

    "Mandalabrahmana": "om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me brahmana i \n the great muni yajnavalkya went to aditya loka the sun s world and saluting him the purusha of the sun said o revered sir describe to me the atman tattva the tattva or truth of atman \n to which narayana viz\n the purusha of the sun replied i shall describe the eight fold yoga together with jnana\n the conquering of cold and heat as well as hunger and sleep the preserving of sweet patience and unruffledness ever and the restraining of the organs from sensual objects all these come under or are yama\n devotion to one s guru love of the true path enjoyment of objects producing happiness internal sait isfaction freedom from association living in a retired place the controlling of the manas and the not longing after the fruits of actions and a state of vairagya all these constitute niyama\n the sitting in any posture pleasant to one and clothed in tatters or bark is prescribed for asana posture \n inspiration restraint of breath and expiration which have respectively and matras constitute pranayama restraint of breath \n the restraining of the mind from the objects of senses is pratyahara subjugation of the senses \n the contemplation of the oneness of consciousness in all objects is dhyana\n the mind having been drawn away from the objects of the senses the fixing of the chaitanya consciousness on one alone is dharana\n the forgetting of oneself in dhyana is samadhi\n he who thus knows the eight subtle parts of yoga attains salvation\n the body has five stains viz\n passion anger out breathing fear and sleep\n the removal of these can be affected respectively by absence of sankalpa forgiveness moderate food carefulness and a spiritual sight of tattvas\n in order to cross the ocean of samsara where sleep and fear are the serpents injury etc\n are the waves trishna thirst is the whirlpool and wife is the mire one should adhere to the subtle path and overstepping tattva and other gunas should look out for taraka\n taraka is brahman which being in the middle of the two eyebrows is of the nature of the spiritual effulgence of sachchidananda\n the spiritual seeing through the three lakshyas or the three kinds of introvision is the means to it brahman \n susumna which is from the muladhara to brahmarandhra has the radiance of the sun\n in the centre of it is kundalini shining like crores of lightning and subtle as the thread in the lotus stalk\n tamas is destroyed there\n through seeing it all sins are destroyed\n when the two ears are closed by the tips of the forefingers a phutkara or booming sound is heard\n when the mind is fixed on it it sees a blue light between the eyes as also in the heart\n this is antar lakshya or internal introvision \n in the bahir lakshya or external introvision one sees in order before his nose at distance of and digits the space of blue colour then a colour resembling shyama indigo black and then shining as rakta red wave and then with the two pita yellow and orange red colours\n then he is a yogin\n when one looks at the external space moving the eyes and sees streaks of light at the corners of his eyes then his vision can be made steady\n when one sees jyoit is spiritual light above his head digits in length then he attains the state of nectar\n in the madhya lakshya or the middle one one sees the variegated colours of the morning as if the sun the moon and the fire had joined together in the akasa that is wiyout them\n then he comes to have their nature of light \n through practice he becomes one with akasa devoid of all gunas and peculiarities\n at first akasa with its shining stars becomes to him para akasa as dark as tamas itself and he becomes one with para akasa shining with stars and deep as tamas\n then he becomes one with maha akasa resplendent as with the fire of the deluge\n then he becomes one with tattva akasa lighted with the brightness which is the highest and the best of all\n then he becomes one with surya akasa sun akasa brightened by a crore of suns\n by pracit ising thus he becomes one with them\n he who knows them becomes thus\n know that yoga is twofold through its division into the purva earlier and the uttara later \n the earlier is taraka and the later is amanaska the mindless \n taraka is divided into murti with limitation and amurti wiyout limitation \n that is murti taraka which goes to the end of the senses or exist till the senses are conquered \n that is amurti taraka which goes beyond the two eyebrows above the senses \n both these should be performed through manas\n antar drishti internal vision associated with manas comes to aid taraka\n tejas spiritual light appears in the hole between the two eyebrows\n this taraka is the earlier one\n the later is amanaska\n the great jyoit is light is above the root of the palate\n by seeing it one gets the siddhis anima etc\n sambhavi mudra occurs when the lakshya spiritual vision is internal while the physical eyes are seeing externally wiyout winking\n this is the great science which is concealed in all the tantras\n when this is known one does not stay in samsara\n its worship or practice gives salvation\n antar lakshya is of the nature of jala jyoit is or water jyoit is \n it is known by the great rishis and is invisible both to the internal and external senses\n the yousand petalled lotus of the pineal gland jala jyoit is is the antar lakshya\n some say the form of purusha in the cave of buddhi beautiful in all its parts is antar lakshya\n some again say that the all quiescent nilakantha accompanied by uma his wife and having five months and latent in the midst of the sphere in the brain is antar lakshya\n whilst others say that the purusha of the dimension of a thumb is antar lakshya\n a few again say antar lakshya is the one self made supreme through introvision in the state of a jivanmukta\n all the different statements above made pertain to atman alone\n he alone is a brahma nishtha who sees that the above lakshya is the pure atman\n the jiva which is the twenty fifth tattva having abandoned the twenty four tattvas becomes a jivanmukta through the conviction that the twenty sixth tattva viz\n paramatman is i alone\n becoming one with antar lakshya brahman in the emancipated state by means of antar lakshya introvision jiva becomes one with the partless sphere of param akasa\n thus ends the first brahmana\n brahmana ii \n then yajnavalkya asked the purusha in the sphere of the sun o lord antar lakshya has been described many times but it has never been understood by me clearly \n pray describe it to me \n he replied it is the source of the five elements has the lustre of many streaks of lightning and has four seats having or rising from that brahman \n in its midst there arises the manifestation of tattva\n it is very hidden and unmanifested\n it can be known only by one who has got into the boat of jnana\n it is the object of both bahir and antar external and internal lakshyas\n in its midst is absorbed the whole world\n it is the vast partless universe beyond nada bindu and kala\n above it viz\n the sphere of agni is the sphere of the sun in its midst is the sphere of the nectary moon in its midst is the sphere of the partless brahma tejas or the spiritual effulgence of brahman \n it has the brightness of sukla white light like the ray of lightning\n it alone has the characteristic of sambhavi\n in seeing this there are three kinds of drishti sight viz\n ama the new moon pratipat the first day of lunar fortnight and purnima the full moon \n the sight of ama is the one seen with closed eyes\n that with half opened eyes is pratipat while that with fully opened eyes is purnima\n of these the practice of purnima should be resorted to\n its lakshya or aim is the tip of the nose\n then is seen a deep darkness at the root of the palate\n by pracit ising thus a jyoit is light of the form of an endless sphere is seen\n this alone is brahman the sachchidananda\n when the mind is absorbed in bliss thus naturally produced then does sambhavi takes place\n she sambhavi alone is called khechari\n by pracit ising it viz\n the mudra a man obtains firmness of mind\n through it he obtains firmness of vayu\n the following are the signs first it is seen like a star then a reflecting or dazzling diamond then the sphere of full moon then the sphere of the brightness of nine gems then the sphere of the midday sun then the sphere of the flame of agni fire all these are seen in order\n thus much for the light in purva or first stage\n then there is the light in the western direction in the uttara or second stage \n then the lustres of crystal smoke bindu nada kala star firefly lamp eye gold and nine gems etc\n this alone is the form of pranava\n having united prana and apana and holding the breath in kumbhaka one should fix his concentration at the tip of his nose and making shanmukhi with the fingers of both his hands one hears the sound of pranava om in which manas becomes absorbed\n such a man has not even the touch of karma\n the karma of sandhyavandana or the daily prayers is verily performed at the rising or setting of the sun\n as there is no rising or setting but only the ever shining of the sun of chit the higher consciousness in the heart of a man who knows thus he has no karma to perform\n rising above the conception of day and night through the annihilation of sound and time he becomes one with brahman through the all full jnana and the attaining of the state of unmani the state above manas \n through the state of unmani he becomes amanaska or wiyout manas \n not being troubled by any youghts of the world then constitutes the dhyana\n the abandoning of all karmas constitutes avahana invocation of god \n being firm in the unshaken spiritual wisdom constitutes asana posture \n being in the state of unmani constitutes the padya offering of water for washing the feet of god \n preserving the state of amanaska when manas is offered as sacrifice constitutes the arghya offering of water as oblation generally \n being in state of eternal brightness and shoreless nectar constitutes snana bathing \n the contemplation of atman as present in all constitutes the application to the idol of sandal\n the remaining in the real state of the drik spiritual eye is the worshipping with akshata non broken rice \n the attaining of chit consciousness is the worshipping with flower\n the real state of agni fire of chit is the dhupa burning of incense \n the state of the sun of chit is the dipa light waved before the image \n the union of one self with the nectar of full moon is the naivedya offering of food etc\n the immobility in that state of the ego being one with all is pradakshina going round the image \n the conception of i am he is namaskara prostration \n the silence then is the sruti praise \n the all contentment or serenity then is the visatjana giving leave to god or finishing worship \n this is the worship of atman by all raja yogins \n he who knows this knows all\n when the triputi are thus dispelled he becomes the kaivalya jyoit is wiyout bhava existence or abhava non existence full and motionless like the ocean wiyout the tides or like the lamp wiyout the wind\n he becomes a brahmavit knower of brahman by cognising the end of the sleeping state even while in the waking state\n though the same mind is absorbed in sushupti as also in samadhi there is much difference between them\n in the former case as the mind is absorbed in tamas it does not become the means of salvation but in samadhi as the modifications of tamas in him are rooted away the mind raises itself to the nature of the partless\n all that is no other than sakshi chaitanya wisdom consciousness or the higher self into which the absorption of the whole universe takes place in as much as the universe is but a delusion or creation of the mind and is therefore not different from it\n though the universe appears perhaps as outside of the mind still it is unreal\n he who knows brahman and who is the sole enjoyer of brahmic bliss which is eternal and has dawned once for all in him that man becomes one with brahman\n he in whom sankalpa perishes has got mukti in his hand\n therefore one becomes an emancipated person through the contemplation of paramatman\n having given up both bhava and abhava one becomes a jivanmukta by leaving off again and again in all states jnana wisdom and jneya object of wisdom dhyana meditation and dhyeya object of meditation lakshya the aim and alakshya non aim drishya the visible and adrishya the nonvisible and uha reasoning and apoha negative reasoning \n he who knows this knows all\n there are five avasthas states jagrat waking swapna dreaming sushupti dreamless sleeping the turya fourth and turyatita that beyond the fourth \n the jiva ego that is engaged in the waking state becomes attached to the pravritti worldly path and is the particular of naraka hell as the fruit of sins\n he desires svarga heaven as the fruit of his virtuous actions\n this very same person becomes afterwards indifferent to all these saying enough of the births tending to actions the fruits of which tend to bondage till the end of this mundane existence \n then he pursues the nivritti return path with a view to attain emancipation\n and this person then takes refuge in a spiritual instructor in order to cross this mundane existence\n giving up passion and others he does only those he is asked to do\n then having acquired the four sadhanas means to salvation he attains in the middle of the lotus of his heart the reality of antar lakshya that is but the sat of lord and begins to recognise or recollect the bliss of brahman which he had left or enjoyed in his sushupti state\n at last he attains this state of discrimination thus i think i am the non dual one only\n i was in ajnana for some time in the waking state and called therefore vishva \n i became somehow or involuntarily a taijasa in the dreaming state through the reflection in that state of the affinities of the forgotten waking state and now i am a prajna through the disappearance of those two states\n therefore i am one only\n i appear as more than one through the differences of state and place\n and there is nothing of differentiation of class besides me \n having expelled even the smack of the difference of conception between i and that through the yought i am the pure and the secondless brahman and having attained the path of salvation which is of the nature of para brahman after having become one with it through the dhyana of the sun s sphere as shining with himself he becomes fully ripened for getting salvation\n sankalpa and others are the causes of the bondage of the mind and the mind devoid of these becomes fit for salvation\n possessing such a mind free from all sankalpa etc\n and withdrawing himself from the outer world of sight and others and so keeping himself out of the odour of the universe he looks upon all the world as atman abandons the conception of i thinks i am brahman and considers all these as atman\n through these he becomes one who has done his duty\n the yogin is one that has realised brahman that is all full beyond turya\n they the people extol him as brahman and becoming the object of the praise of the whole world he wanders over different countries\n placing the bindu in the akasa of paramatman and pursuing the path of the partless bliss produced by the pure secondless stainless and innate yoga sleep of amanaska he becomes an emancipated person\n then the yogin becomes immersed in the ocean of bliss\n when compared to it the bliss of indra and others is very little\n he who gets this bliss is the supreme yogin\n thus ends the second brahmana\n brahmana iii \n the great sage yajnavalkya then asked the purusha in the sphere of the sun o lord yough the nature of amanaska has been defined by you yet i forget it or do not understand it clearly \n therefore pray explain it again to me\n accordingly the purusha said this amanaska is a great secret\n by knowing this one becomes a person who had done his duty\n one should look upon it as paramatman associated with sambhavi mudra and should know also all those that can be known through a thorough cognition of them\n then seeing para brahman in his own atman as the lord of all the immeasurable the birthless the auspicious the supreme akasa the supportless the secondless the only goal of brahma vishnu and rudra and the cause of all and assuring himself that he who plays in the cave of the heart is such a one he should raise himself above the dualities of existence and nonexistence and knowing the experience of the unmani of his mans he then attains the state of parabrahman which is motionless as a lamp in a windless place having reached the ocean of brahmic bliss by means of the river of amanaska yoga through the destruction of all his senses\n then he resembles a dry tree\n having lost all idea of the universe through the disappearance of growth sleep disease expiration and inspiration his body being always steady he comes to have a supreme quiescence being devoid of the movements of his manas and becomes absorbed in paramatman\n the destruction of mans takes place after the destruction of the collective senses like the cow s udder that shrivels up after the milk has been drawn\n it is this that is amanaska\n by following this one becomes always pure and becomes one that has done his duty having been filled with the partless bliss by means of the path of taraka yoga through the initiation into the sacred sentences i am pa that thou art i am you alone thou art i alone etc\n when his mans is immersed in the akasa and he becomes all full and when he attains the unmani state having abandoned all his collective senses he conquers all sorrows and impurities through the partless bliss having attained the fruits of kaivalya ripened through the collective merits gathered in all his previous lives and thinking always i am brahman becomes one that has done his duty\n i am thou alone\n there is no difference between you and me owing to the fullness of paramatman \n saying thus he the purusha of the sun embraced his pupil and made him understand it\n thus ends the third brahmana\n brahmana iv then yajnavalkya addressed the purusha in the sphere of the sun thus pray explain to me in detail the nature of the five fold division of akasa \n he replied there are five akasa parakasa mahakasa suryakasa and paramakasa\n that which is of the nature of darkness both in and out is the first akasa\n that which has the fire of deluge both in and out is truly mahakasa\n that which has the brightness of the sun both in and out is suryakasa\n that brightness which is indestructible all pervading and of the nature of unrivalled bliss is paramakasa\n by cognising these according to this description one becomes of their nature\n he is a yogin only in name who does not cognise well the nine chakras the six adharas the three lakshyas and the five akasa\n thus ends the fourth brahmana\n brahmana v the manas influenced by worldly objects is liable to bondage and that mans which is not so influenced by these is fit for salvation\n hence all the world becomes an object of chitta whereas the same chitta when it is supportless and well ripe in the state of unmani becomes woryour of laya absorption in brahman \n this absorption you should learn from me who am the all full\n i alone am the cause of the absorption of manas\n the mans is within the jyoit is spiritual light which again is latent in the spiritual sound which pertains to the anahata heart sound\n that manas which is the agent of creation preservation and destruction of the three worlds that same manas becomes absorbed in that which is the highest seat of vishnu through such an absorption one gets the pure and secondless state owing to the absence of difference then\n this alone is the highest truth\n he who knows this will wander in the world like a lad or an idiot or a demon or simpleton\n by pracit ising this amanaska one is ever contented his urine and faeces become diminished his food becomes lessened he becomes strong in body and his limbs are free from disease and sleep\n then his breath and eyes being motionless he realises brahman and attains the nature of bliss\n that ascetic who is intent on drinking the nectar of brahman produced by the long practice of this kind of samadhi becomes a paramahamsa ascetic or an avadhuta naked ascetic \n by seeing him all the world becomes pure and even an illiterate person who serves him is freed from bondage\n he the ascetic enables the members of his family for one hundred and one generations to cross the ocean of samsara and his mother father wife and children all these are similarly freed\n thus is the upanishad\n thus ends the fifth brahmana\n om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the mandalabrahmaana upanishad belonging to the sukla yajur veda",

efficiency may we both attain effective may our study prove may we not hate each other at all om shanti shanti shanti i am now going to explain the principles behind the tripat narayana philosophy which if understood and grasped fully can cull out and weed all forms of illusory material that surrounds all living in this materialistic world\n om the supreme being known as narayana desired to create living beings\n and out of such desire or vow the living force of breath called prana stems out from the supreme being the mind manas and all other sense organs come into being\n also created along with are the sky the air the light the water and the earth which bears all the beings\n out of narayana arises the brahma the deity who is the creator of all beings and also the indra who is the ruler of all devas\n out of him comes prajapati the deity who originates and controls the people as well as the twelve adityas eleven rudras and eight vasus various controlling forces mentioned in the vedas each concerning a distinct and different force of nature \n it is only out of the same narayana that all vedas came into existence\n thus all forces come out of narayana and also finally merge into him\n thus proclaims one of the upanishads in the rig veda\n narayanan is ever present and eternal he is omnipotent and omnipresent brahma siva indra all these deities are various forms of narayana himself\n he indeed is all forms of time space and direction\n all directions of up down sides in and out are his shadow cast\n all that is existing and the ones to come into existence are narayana himself\n the single supreme being devoid of any form of impurity which cannot be expressed in words and which is the purest of all pure is narayanan\n there is nothing above him and no second power than his\n that one who understands this as such becomes merges with the narayana himself he becomes merges with the narayana himself repeated stress \n thus asserts one of the upanishads in the yajur veda\n first utter the syllable om then utter the words namah and narayanaya \n these words respectively are made of one two and five syllables as in sanskrit thus the entire phrase is made of eight syllables or called as ashta aksharam ashta eight aksharam syllable \n that one who chants this eight syallable mantra of narayana lives long wiyout any disrepute or notoriety he is blessed with rulership wealth cattle and servants and ultimately attains the moksha or the point of no return also called as salvation he attains the moksha repeated with stress \n thus states one of the upanishads in the sama veda\n that blissful supreme being brahman which resides within is of the form of om or pranava\n the pranava om is made of a u and m\n that grew in multiples\n the blessed one who recites and chants the syllable om he gets rid of all the bindings and bonds of this material world\n the one who chants the words om namo narayanaya ultimately attains the vaikunda the abode of sri narayana or the heaven the home of salvation \n the vaikunda is not to be found anywhere else but in a pure blessed heart filled with knowledge spiritual \n from there rises an offshoot of light as bright as a ray of lightning\n that ray of light is representative of the various forms of narayana called by names such as son of devaki the one sweeter than honey the one in the form of brahma the one with lotus like eyes vishnu or the savior of all \n he resides within all beings and controls all their activities\n he is the form of non materialistic syllable om the supreme being\n thus states one of the upanishads in the atharva veda\n having thus known what each of the four vedas say about narayana now let us understand the fruits of chanting his mantra \n that one who chants this mantra in the morning destroys all his sins committed during the previous night\n the one who chants this in the evening destroys all sins committed during the day\n that one who chants this during mid day looking at the sun destroys all the five kinds of major and minor sins described as the worst in the scriptures\n he gets all the benefits of having chanted all the vedas\n ultimately he merges into and becomes one with the supreme being narayana\n om may brahman protect us the guru and sishya both may he give us both enough to enjoy efficiency may we both attain effective may our study prove may we not hate each other at all om shanti shanti shanti om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we

bikshu sanaka and prahlada approached lord hanuman who was a great devotee of vishnu and asked him which is the greatest principle among the four veda s purana s smriti s sastra s all knowledge and among the great powers ruled by the sun and moon he replied hey great sages and devotees of lord vishnu please hear my words which cut of all attachments the greatest principle among these is the principle of brahma taraka om \n rama is parabrahma and supreme austerity and rama is the supreme essence and brahma taraka\n they all again asked lord hanuman please tell us the angas aspects of lord

shatrughna bharata vibheeshana sugreeva angada jambavanta and pranava are the angas of lord rama\n wiyout these angas lord rama will not remove all roadblocks\n they again asked how will brahmins and householders get the capacity to recite pranava he said all people even if they are not eligible to chant om who chant the six letter mantra would get the capacity to meditate on pranava\n those who chant silently the mantra of rama would get the same effect as repeating the letter om \n after the name of rishi devata and meter japa of the rama mantra would give the same effect as repetition of pranava and further he explained that rama himself has said that pranava is a part of rama mantra\n on another occasion answering vibheeshana s question how can your angas be made easy to worship please tell me an easy way\n rama replied the japa of my name rama removes all sins\n suppose some one is meditating on my six lettered mantra or reads my gita or thinks of me with devotional fervor he would get the same effect\n he would get rid of the five great sins viz\n killing of father killing of mother killing of brothers killing of teachers killing of husband or even other well known great sins if one repeats my six lettered mantra ten million times\n he also would get the immortal and ever lasting bliss\n vibheeshana again asked him what would be the way for people who are not capable of doing it\n rama replied they can either read my gita my yousand names or meditate on my viswa roopa or my names or repeat my name times or read the king of stotras written by sage narada or read the great prayer called mantra raja stavam written by hanuman or read the prayer to sita or daily pray to me by reciting my name they will doubtless attain me\n here ends the first chapter\n second chapter the great sages led by sanaka asked hanuman again please tell us the mantra for meditating or worshipping the taraka brahma rama\n that king of mantra s is the ekakshara one syllabled which is the store house of fire which is lord vishnu who is lying down and which is lord shiva who adorned with the crescent moon\n its sage is brahma meter is gayatri deity is lord rama its anga is waxing half moon and its mind is the soul of fire \n its root is the beeja shakti and it has to be chanted for fulfillment of desires\n the prayer dhyana sloka for the mantra is he who sits on the lotus flower on the shores of river sarayu \n he who is black seated on the throne of heroes who shines in the jnana mudra that he shows whose left side is adorned by sita and lakshmana \n he who shines as their soul to those souls who pray to him who is like the clear crystal who is the only source to those who wish for salvation \n he who is the paramatma to those thinkers who shines like the millions of suns who is like narayana residing in the nadi s who is digestive fire\n the king of mantras with two syllables rama would lead to fulfillment of all desires and along with the suffix of one letter it becomes six different mantras they are om hrim srim klim aim and ram\n these king of mantras consisting of three syllables also will fulfill all desires\n the two four lettered mantras are ramachandra and ramabhadra\n these can be chanted with the rishi and others as told before viswamithra is its rishi the meter is pankti devatha is ramabhadra the bheeja is shakthi\n this

killed ravana who is extremely peaceful and before whom stand sugreeva and vibeeshana\n for achieving victory one should chant this sloka ten million times\n the five lettered mantra s are formed by adding the root letters for manmatha durga saraswati and lakshmi at the beginning of the four lettered mantra adding om to make it six syllabled and lead to the realization of the four purushartha s\n when each of the fifty mystic syllables of the sanskrit alphabet nasalized as well as the root letters of lakshmi saraswati manmatha and om are added as the first syllable several varieties of six

rama om the pair of shri bija s and shakti bija and others are also added \n thereafter one recites the mantra s with the limbed nyasa and recites ramaya namah with om and a pair of shri bija s\n shiva rama mantra glaum om maya bija heart abiding ramaya namah is recited again\n shiva om rama mantra is the giver of all excellence\n sadashiva is spoken of as the rishi gayatri as the meter and shiva om ramachandra as the deity\n dhyanam i worship that rama who has three eyes who wears the crescent who holds the trident who is anointed all over by ash and who is with matted hair\n i worship the three eyed one who is abhirama the pinnacle of beauty who wears the crescent as ear ring and who holds the noose the goad the bow and the arrow \n thus meditating devoted wholly to recitation and oblations one shall chant mantra s one hundred yousand times offering bilva leaves fruits flowers gingili seeds and lotuses\n rama brahma gayatri even the treasures and powers wished for by the celestials come by themselves when the lettered raghava brahmaa gayatri is chanted \n the rishis knowing shri bija as my shakti chant the mantra s with the limbs as viniyoga for its adoration\n

tell us about the altar yantra for the worship by the aforesaid mantra s\n hanuman replied to begin with the altar is six sided hexagonal and in the center is written the seed letter bijakshara of rama ram with shrim\n below that in the second corner is the sadhya food offering \n above it on the sixth corner is the sadhakam constant devotion \n on the surrounding sides are the seed letters of jiva prana shakti\n encircling all these is om\n in the south east north east north west south west on the front corners are kept the cooked rice\n then sequentially the heart mantra s viz ram rim rum raim raum rah bija akshara s the heart astra mantras are to be recited\n behind the corners are the bija akshara of rama and maya on the corners varaham hum over this is the kama bija ram and surrounding it is the vac kiim \n thereafter are three circles of eight leaves\n on the leaves garlands of syllables in eight groups of six lettered mantras are inscribed\n ending with five lettered mantra\n on the face of each leaf the eight lettered mantras \n again the petalled lotus\n on the petals the lettered narayana mantra\n om namo narayanaya on the face of each petal shri bija\n then the first round\n then the petalled\n on them the lettered vasudeva mantra\n om namo bhagavate vasudevaya as well as on their fronts in all directions\n in a circular manner\n on the petals hum phat with the lettered rama mantra om namo bhagavate ramachandraya \n on the front of the petal maya bija kiim \n on the front of each in two circles hram sram bhram bram bhramam shrum jram\n then in a circle\n thereafter the petalled\n on them the king of mantra s nrisimha anushtubh\n on front of these the vasu s rudra s aditya mantra s along with om and namo in sequence in dative case\n outside and surrounding is vashat\n then the bhupura of three lines\n in directions adorned with the rashi s zodiac signs \n abiding there the naga s serpents \n in the directions the narasimha bija\n in the intermediate directions the varaha bija\n this all encompassing yantra fulfills all wishes and grants liberation\n beginning with the lettered and ending with the lettered mantra s this is the yantra and the tenth becomes the avarana covering for it \n one should worship raghava with anga nyasa in the center of the hexagon\n in the first round the anga nyasa is done at all the corners\n at the root of the petals the initial cover of oneself\n then the covering by vasudeva and others\n at the base of the second petals the cow covering \n then covers of hanuman and other\n for the petalled vasishtha covering\n for the petalled the blue lotus covering\n for the petalled dhruva covering\n in the bhupura indra covering\n outside this is the vajra covering\n offering thus one should silently chant\n now the altar is described for the mantras starting with syllables and ending with syllables\n in its center the name of the ishta \n thus surrounded by kama bija\n the remaining nine surround this\n at the six corners the fold anga nyasa in the front and back of the intermediate directions se n e n w s w \n on the face the shri maya bija in the corners krodha\n then the first round\n then the petals on the petals garlands of syllables in multiples of \n in a circular manner\n surrounding this in all directions\n outside this the bhupura with spear points\n in all

their front the bow and the arrow\n at the base of the petals two avarana s of hanuman\n the third avarana of cow\n thus worshipping the yantra with devotion one should recite the lettered and other mantras\n thus ends the third chapter of rama rahasya upanishad\n fourth chapter sanaka and other ascetics asked hanuman describe the ritual for recitation of rama mantras\n hanuman replied the one who intends to recite this mantra should follow the following procedures \n he should bathe thrice a day\n he should take only sathvic foods like milk roots fruits or naivedya rice pudding offered to the god \n he should follow the prescribed karmas of the stage of his life brahmachari grahastha vanaprastha or sanyasi \n he should give up the six negative emotions like anger jealousy etc\n he should observe purity and practice dispassionate speech\n he should also observe dispassionate action and show respect to all women\n he should observe celibacy and sleep on the bare ground\n he should not have any desires\n he should be devoted to his teacher\n he should scrupulously observe bath worship recitation meditation and oblation to the fire\n he should meditate with utmost concentration on rama as instructed by his teacher\n he should invoke the sun moon teacher lamp cow brahmin etc\n the ascetic doing this japa should sit on a tiger skin and adopt postures prescribed like the swasthikasana in rotating sequence\n he should seat himself below plants like thulasi or trees like parijata bilwa etc\n he should count using a rosary whose beads are either made of thulasi plant or use rudraksha\n the counting should be done mentally using the beads and should be one hundred yousand times at the altar of maha vishnu\n tharpana should be offered after every ten total count\n after ten counts offer rice pudding pour over it clarified butter made from cow s milk and eat what remains after the next tenth portion\n after this along with chanting flowers have to be offered along with the chanting of moola mantra \n the ascetic who does this japa becomes liberated in life and the supernatural powers follow him like a bride follows her groom\n this rama mantra is not only a means to liberation but if you remember me who am rama s servant it will ensure success in these worldly affairs too\n to the one who for ever remembers rama with total devotion as the final refuge of the mind i am empowered to fulfill all their chosen wishes\n towards the task of fulfillment of the wishes of the devotees of rama i as an expert in carrying out rama s commands am always wholly alert\n thus ends the fourth chapter of rama rahasya upanishad\n fifth chapter conclusion sanaka and other ascetics asked hanuman tell us the meaning of sri rama mantra \n hanuman replied among the rama mantras the lettered is the king among them all yough as mentioned earlier they exist as one or two or three or four or five syllables or even as six or seven or eight or even as many more syllables\n lord shiva knows in essence the glory of the six syllables mantra shri ramah sharanam mama \n the true meaning of the king among the rama mantras as well as of the eight lettered narayana and five lettered shiva mantras is spoken of as thus where yogi s revel in the syllable mantra viz\n ra ma where the ra syllable denotes fire wherein abides illumination\n its nature as existence consciousness bliss is regarded as the supreme meaning the consonant denoting the unchanging brahman and the syllable the energy of manifestation\n know that consonants joined to syllables are used in breathing the sound r of the nature of light is therefore used in action\n the sound ma is known as maya indicating prosperity being itself the seed letter bijakshara is also equal to brahman itself\n with the bindu anusvara the purusha takes on the form of shiva sun moon the flame as the crest and the sound as the prakriti\n both purusha and prakriti jointly are considered as brahman the bindu sound and the indwelling seed letter as fire and digits of the moon\n fire and om by their very nature abide in the seed syllables of rama just as the great tree in the mundane life is contained in its seed\n similarly in the seed syllables rama is contained this whole moving and unmoving world\n the name rama is thus regarded as the seed with both these meanings\n when freed of the maya seed kiim the supreme spirit is said to exist alone \n this grants liberation to aspirants and the ma sound is regarded as the liberator\n formless ma in rama is the grantor of enjoyment and liberation\nthe first letter ra stands for the term tat that and ma stands for the term tvam you \n the wise knower of truth declare that the confluence of the above two terms end in the meaning asi are \n the word namah has the meaning of tvam you and tat is denoted by the word rama\n when used in the dative case ramaya the meaning asi are is indicated in the mantra\n wherefore the sentence tattvamasi grants the unitive salvation\n therefore this mantra giver of enjoyment and liberation surpasses the afore said sentence tattvamasi \n all embodied human beings are qualified for this mantra\n for those desiring liberation the dispassionate ones as well as house holders and in all stages of life constant meditation of om and especially for ascetics is enjoined for the knower of the meaning of rama mantra doubtless become liberated while alive\n one who studies this upanishad becomes sanctified by fire purified by air is freed from the sin of consuming intoxicants or of theft of gold or of the slaying of a brahmin\n one who recites the rama mantra repeatedly merges in ramachandra himself\n therefore this sacred hymn those whoever say i am rama in essence will not feel any want in this life and wiyout a doubt is rama himself \n this is the truth\n this is the upanishad\n om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may

ascribed to para brahman which is holy wiyout any second which does not have any blemishes and which is bodiless so that the worshippers are shown the path\n similar to the whole banyan tree existing in the seed of the banyan tree the entire world exists in the seed rama \n rama when incarnated shone along with sita who is nature herself like the moon shining with its moonlight\n he who was born to mother kousalya was black in colour wore yellow silk had his hair made up wore ear studs and chains of precious stones had in his hand the bow had two hands had a very pleasant smiling face and was heroic and blessed with victory and ruled with the help of eight ministers lead by drishti\n he was keeping the parameshwari who was the mother of the world who was nature who had two hands who was well made up and was holding lotus flower in her hand on his lap and lightly embracing her\n he with sita formed a triangle with lakshmana who was holding a bow in his hand and was golden in colour\n the devas approached him who was sitting below the wish giving tree in the form of a triangle and prayed our salutations to you who is personification of passion and illusion and also a god primeval to vedas\n our salutations to the raghu veera who killed ravana who is drowned in joy by keeping goddess lakshmi on his chest who is the personification of all souls who is an ornament to the body of janaki daughter of janaka who killed rakshasas who is very handsome and who is personification of all that is good\n the devas further told hey the killer of ravana please give us your protection and your grace\n then they were with him and became very happy\n on his left with satrugna on his right with bharata and on his front hanuman who was listening to his advices there was another triangle\n below bharata was sugreeva and below him was vibheeshana\n behind him lakshmana was holding an umbrella and below him vibheeshana and sugreeva were holding fans made of palm leaves\n this was another inverted triangle\n so the long armed lord rama who was shining was meditating in between this figure with six vertices\n this is the first row surrounding him\n the second is surrounded by vasudeva and others santhi sankarshana sree pradyumna saraswathi anirudha and rathi as well as fire and others in different directions\n third is surrounded by hanuman sugreeva bharata vibheeshana lakshmana angada jambhavan satrugna as well as drushti jayantha vijaya surashtra rashtra vardhana ashoka darmapala and sumandra\n fourth is surrounded by the dig balakas protectors of directions viz\n indra agni fire god yama god of death nirruthi varuna chandra isana brahma and anantha\n fifth is beyond the dig balakas and consists of their principal arms viz\n vajra shakthi danda vara pasa angusa gada soola madma and chakra these should be worshipped\n sixth after the arms neela and other monkeys\n vasishta vamadeva and other sages worship him\n he should be meditated and worshipped\n thus worship sri rama who has the form which is the foundation of this world and who is forever joyful\n all people who worship him as the one carrying mace sword conch and lotus and who is known as the one who

praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me chapter i \n sandilya questioned atharvan thus please tell me about the eight angas parts of yoga which is the means of attaining to atman \n atharvan replied the eight angas of yoga are yama niyama asana pranayama pratyahara dharana dhyana and samadhi\n of these yama is of ten kinds and so is niyama\n there are eight asanas\n pranayama is of three kinds pratyahara is of five kinds so also is dharana\n dhyana is of two kinds and samadhi is of one kind only\n under yama forbearance are ten ahimsa satya asteya brahmacharya daya arjava kshama dhriti mitahara and saucha\n of these ahimsa is the not causing of any pain to any living being at any time through the actions of one s mind speech or body\n satya is the speaking of the truth that conduces to the well being of creatures through the actions of one s mind speech or body\n asteya is not coveting of another s property through the actions of one s mind speech or body\n brahmacharya is the refraining from sexual inter course in all places and in all states in mind speech or body\n daya is kindliness towards all creatures in all places\n arjava is the preserving of equanimity of mind speech or body in the performance or non performance of the actions ordained or forbidden to be done\n kshama is the bearing patiently of all pleasant or unpleasant things such as praise or blow\n dhriti is the preserving of firmness of mind during the period of gain or loss of wealth or relatives\n mitahara is the taking of oily and sweet food leaving one fourth of the stomach empty\n saucha is of two kinds external and internal\n of these the external is the cleansing of the body by earth and water the internal is the cleansing of the mind\n this the latter is to be obtained by means of the adhyatma vidya science of self \n under niyama religious observances are ten viz\n tapas santosha astikya dana ishvarapujana siddhanta sravana hrih mati japa and vrata\n of these tapas is the emancipation of the body through the observances of such penances as krichchhra chandrayana etc\n santosha is being sait isfied with whatever comes to us of its own accord\n astikya is the belief in the merits or demerits of actions as stated in the vedas\n dana is the giving with faith to deserving persons money grains etc\n ishvarapujana is the worshipping of vishnu rudra etc\n with pure mind according to one s power\n siddhanta sravana is the inquiry into the significance of vedanta\n hrih is the shame felt in the performance of things contrary to the rules of the vedas and of society\n mati is the faith in the paths laid down by the vedas\n japa is the pracit ising of the mantras into which one is duly initiated by his spiritual instructor and which is not against the rules of the vedas\n it is of two kinds the spoken and the mental\n the mental is associated with contemplation by the mind\n the spoken is of two kinds the loud and the low\n the loud pronunciation gives the reward as stated in the vedas while the low one gives a reward yousand times that \n the mental gives a reward a crore of times that \n vrata is the regular observance of or the refraining from the actions enjoined or prohibited by the vedas\n asanas the postures are chiefly eight viz\n svastika gomukha padma vira simha bhadra mukta and mayura\n svastika is the sitting at ease with the body erect placing each foot between the thighs and knees of the other\n gomukha is the sitting at ease with the body erect placing the hollow of the left foot under the side of the right posteriors and the hollow of the right foot under the side of the left posteriors resembling gomukha cow s face \n padma is the sitting at ease with the body erect placing the back of each foot in the thigh of the other the right hand grasping the right toe and the left hand to left toe\n this o sandilya is praised by all\n vira is the sitting at ease with the body erect placing one foot on the thigh of the other and the other foot underneath the corresponding opposite thigh \n simha is the sitting at ease with the body erect pressing the right side of the thigh with the hollow of left heel and vice versa\n rest your hands on the knees spread out the fingers open your mouth and carefully fix your gaze on the tip of your nose\n this is always praised by the yogins\n siddha is the sitting at ease with the body erect pressing the perineum with the left heel and placing the heel of the right foot above the genital organ concentrating the mind between the two eyebrows\n bhadra is the sitting at ease with the body erect pressing the two ankles of the two feet firmly together against the sivini viz\n lower part of the seed and binding the knees firmly with the hands\n this is the bhadra which destroys all diseases and poisons\n mukta is the sitting at ease with the body erect pressing with the left heel the right side of the tender part of the sivini and with the right heel the lest side of the tender part of the sivini\n peacock rest your body upon the ground with both palms and place your elbows on the sides of the navel lift up the head and feet and remain like a stick in the air like the plant balance in gymnastics \n this is the mayura posture which destroys all sins\n by these all the diseases within the body are destroyed all the poisons are digested\n let the person who is unable to pracit ise all these postures betake himself to any one of these which he may find easy and pleasant\n he who conquers or gets mastery over the postures he conquers the three worlds\n a person who has the practice of yama and niyama should pracit ise pranayama by that the nadis become purified\n then sandilya questioned atharvan thus by what means are the nadis purified how many are they in number how do they arise what vayus vital airs are located in them what are their seats what are their functions whatever is woryour of being known in the body please tell me \n to that atharvan replied thus this body is ninety six digits in length\n prana extends twelve digits beyond the body\n he who through the practice of yoga reduces his prana within his body to make it equal to or not less than the fire in it becomes the greatest of the yogins\n in men the region of fire which is triangular in form and brilliant as the molten gold is situated in the middle of the body\n in fourfooted animals it fire is quadrangular\n in birds it is round\n in its the region of life s centre the purifying beneficial and subtle flame is situate\n two digits above the anus and two digits below the sexual organ is the centre of the body for men\n for four footed animals it is the middle of the heart\n for birds it is the middle of the body\n nine digits from or above the centre of the body and four digits in length and breadth is situated an oval form\n in its midst is the navel\n in it is situated the chakra viz\n wheel with twelve spokes\n in the middle of the chakra the jiva atman wanders driven by its good and bad deeds\n as a spider flies to and fro within a web of fine threads so prana moves about here\n in this body the jiva rides upon prana\n lying in the middle of the navel and above it is the seat of kundalini\n the kundalini sakti is of the form of eight prakriit is matter and coils itself eight ways or times \n the movement of vayus vital airs checks duly the food and drink all round by the side of skandha\n it closes by its head the opening of the brahmarandhra and during the time of the practice of yoga is awakened by the fire in the apana then it shines with great brilliancy in the akasa of the heart in the shape of wisdom\n depending upon kundalini which is situated in the centre there are fourteen principal nadis viz\n ida pingala susumna sarasvati varuni pusha hastijihva yasasvini visvodhari kuhuh sankhini payasvini alambusa and gandhari\n of them susumna is said to be the sustainer of the universe and the path of salvation\n situated at the back of the anus it is attached to the spinal column and extends to the brahmarandhra of the head and is invisible and subtle and is vaishnavi or has the sakti force of vishnu \n on the left of susumna is situated ida and on the right is pingala\n the moon moves in ida and the sun in pingala\n the moon is of the nature of tamas and the sun of rajas\n the poison share is of the sun and the nectar of the moon\n they both direct or indicate time and susumna is the enjoyer or consumer of time\n to the back and on the side of susumna are situate sarasvati and kuhuh respectively\n between yasasvini and kuhuh stands varuni\n between pusha and sarasvati lies payasvini\n between gandhari and sarasvati is situated yasasvini\n in the centre of the navel is alambusa\n in front of susumna there is kuhuh which proceeds as far as the genital organ\n above and below kundalini is situated varuni which proceeds everywhere\n yasasvini which is beautiful or belonging to the moon proceeds to the great toes\n pingala goes upwards to the right nostril\n payasvini goes to right ear\n sarasvati goes to the upper part or the tongue and sankhini to the left ear while gandhari goes from the back of ida to the left eye\n alambusa goes upwards and downwards from the root of the anus\n from these fourteen nadis other minor nadis spring from them springing others and from them springing others so it should be known\n as the leaf of the asvattha tree ficus religiosa etc\n is covered with minute fibres so also is this body permeated with nadis\n prana apana samana udana vyana naga kurma krikara devadatta and dhananjaya these ten vayus vital airs move in all the nadis\n prana moves in the nostrils the throat the navel the two great toes and the lower and the upper parts of kundalini\n vyana moves in the ear the eye the loins the ankles the nose the throat and the buttocks\n apana moves in the anus the genitals the thighs the knees the stomach the seeds the lions the calves the navel and the seat of the anus of fire\n udana lives in all the joints and also in the hands and legs\n samana lives permeating in all parts of the body\n along with the fire in the body it causes the food and drink taken in to spread in the body\n it moves in the seventy two yousand nadis and pervades all over the body along with the fire\n the fire vayus beginning with naga go towards the skin the bones etc\n the prana which is in the navel separates the food and drink which is there and brings about the rasas juices and others\n placing the water above the fire and the food above or in the water it goes to the apana and along with it fans up the fire in the centre of the body\n the fire thus fanned up by the apana gradually increases in brightness in the middle of the body\n then it causes through its flames the water which is brought in the bowels by the prana to grow hot\n the fire with the water causes the food and conditions which are placed above to be boiled to a proper degree\n then prana separates these into sweat urine water blood semen the faeces and the like\n and along with the samana it takes the juice or essence to all the nadis and moves in the body in the shape of breath\n the vayus excrete the urine the faeces etc\n through the nine openings in the body which are connected with the outside air\n the functions of prana are inspiration expiration and cough\n those of apana are the excretion of the faeces and the urine\n those of vyana are such actions as giving and taking\n those of udana are keeping the body straight etc\n those of samana are nourishing the body\n those of naga are vomiting etc\n of kurma the movement of the eyelids of krikara the causing of hunger etc\n of devadatta idleness etc\n having thus acquired a thorough knowledge of the seat of the nadis and of the vayus with their functions one should begin with the purification of the nadis\n a person possessed of yama and niyama avoiding all company having finished his course of study delighting in truth and virtue having conquered his anger being engaged in the service of his spiritual instructor and having been obedient to his parents and well instructed in all the religious practices and the knowledge of his order of life should go to a sacred grove abounding in fruits roots and water\n there he should select a pleasant spot always resounding with the chanting of the vedas frequented by the knowers of brahman that persevere in the duties of their orders of life and filled with fruits roots flowers and water\n else either in a temple or on the banks of a river or in a village or in a town he should build a beautiful monastery\n it should be neither too long nor too high should have a small door should be besmeared well with cow dung and should have every sort of protection\n there listening to the exposition of vedanta he should begin to pracit ise yoga\n in the beginning having worshipped vinayaka ganesha he should salute his ishta devata tutelary deity and sitting in any of the above mentioned postures on a soft seat facing either the east or the north and having conquered them the learned man keeping his head and neck erect and fixing his gaze on the tip of his nose should see the sphere of the moon between his eyebrows and drink the nectar flowing therefrom through his eyes \n inhaling the air through ida for the space of twelve matras he should contemplate on the sphere of fire situated in the belly as surrounded with flames and having as its seed ra then he should exhale it through pingala\n again inhaling it through pingala and retaining it within he should exhale it through ida\n for the period of twenty eight months he should pracit ise six times at every sitting through the three sandhyas morning noon and evening and during the intervals\n by this the nadis becomes purified\n then the body becomes light and bright the gastric fire is increased within and there is the manifestation of nada internal sound \n pranayama is said to be the union of prana and apana\n it is of three kinds expiration inspiration and cessation\n they are associated with the letters of the sanskrit alphabet for the right performance of pranayama \n therefore pranava om only is said to be pranayama\n sitting in the padma posture the person should meditate that there is at the tip of his nose gayatri a girl of red complexion surrounded by the numberless rays of the image of the moon and mounted on a hamsa swan and having a mace in her hand\n she is the visible symbol of the letter a \n the letter u has as its visible symbol savitri a young woman of white colour having a disk in her hand and riding on a garuda eagle \n the letter m has as its visible symbol sarasvati an aged woman of black colour riding on a bull having a trident in her hand\n he should meditate that the single letter the supreme light the pranava om is the origin or source of these three letters a u and m \n drawing up the air through ida for the space of sixteen matras he should meditate on the letter a during that time retaining the inspired air for the space of sixty four matras he should meditate on the letter u during the time he should then exhale the inspired air for the space of thirty two matras meditating on the letter m during that time\n he should pracit ise this in the above order over and over again\n then having become firm in the posture and preserved perfect self control the yogin should in order to clear away the impurities of the susumna sit in the padmasana padma posture and having inhaled the air through the left nostril should retain it as long as he can and should exhale it through the right\n then drawing it again through the right and having retained it he should exhale it through the left in the order that he should draw it through the same nostril by which he exhaled it before and retained it\n in this context occur to memory the following verses in the beginning having inhaled the breath prana through the left nostril according to the rule he should exhale it through the other then having inhaled the air through the right nostril should retain it and exhale it through the other\n to those who pracit ise according to these rules through the right and left nostrils the nadis become purified within three months\n he should pracit ise cessation of breath at sunrise in the midday at sunset and at midnight slowly till eighty times a day for four weeks\n in the early stages perspiration is produced in the middle stage the tremor of the body and in the last stage levitation in the air\n these results ensure out of the repression of the breath while sitting in the padma posture\n when perspiration arises with effort he should rub his body well\n by this the body becomes firm and light\n in the early course of his practice food with milk and ghee is excellent\n one sticking to this rule becomes firm in his practice and gets no tapa or burning sensation in the body \n as lions elephants and tigers are gradually tamed so also the breath when rightly managed comes under control else it kills the practitioner\n he should as far as is consistent with his health and safety properly exhale it properly inhale it or retain it properly\n thus only will he attain success\n by thus retaining the breath in an approved manner and by the purification of the nadis the brightening of the gastric fire the hearing distinctly of spiritual sounds and good health result\n when the nervous centres have become purified through the regular practice of pranayama the air easily forces its way up through the mouth of the susumna which is in the middle\n by the contraction of the muscles of the neck and by the contraction of the one below viz\n apana the prana breath goes into the susumna which is in the middle from the west nadi\n drawing up the apana and forcing down the prana from the throat the yogin free from old age becomes a youth of sixteen\n seated in a pleasant posture and drawing up the air through the right nostril and retaining it inside from the top of the hair to the toe nails he should exhale it through the same nostril\n through it the brain becomes purified and the diseases in the air nadis are destroyed\n drawing up the air through the nostrils with noise so as to fill the space from the heart to the neck and having retained it within as long as possible he should exhale it through the nose\n through this hunger thirst idleness and sleep do not arise\n taking in the air through the mouth wide open and having retained it as long as possible he should expel it through the nose\n through this such diseases as gulma pleeha both being splenetic diseases bile and fever as also hunger etc\n now we shall proceed to kumbhaka restraint of breath \n it is of two kinds sahita and kevala\n that which is coupled with expiration and inspiration is called sahita\n that which is devoid of these is called kevala alone \n until you become perfect in kevala pracit ise sahita\n to one who has mastered kevala there is nothing unattainable in the three worlds\n by kevala restraint of breath the knowledge of kundalini arises\n then he becomes lean in body serene in face and clear eyed hears the spiritual sounds distinctly becomes free from all diseases and conquers his bindu seminal fluid his gastric fire being increased\n centring one s mind on an inward object whilst his eyes are looking outside wiyout shutting and opening of his eyelids has been called vaishnavi mudra\n this is kept hidden in all the tantric works\n with his mind and breath absorbed in an internal object the yogin yough he does not really see the objects outside and under him still appears to see them with eyes in which the pupils are motionless\n this is called khechari mudra\n it has as its sphere of extension one object and is very beneficial\n then the real seat of vishnu which is void and non void dawns on him\n with eyes half closed and with a firm mind fixing his eyes on the tip of his nose and becoming absorbed in the sun and moon he after remaining thus unshaken becomes conscious of the thing which is resplendent which is the supreme truth and which is beyond\n o sandilya know this to be tat that \n merging the sound in the light and elevating the brows a little this is of the way of or is a part of the former practice\n this brings about the state of unmani which causes the destruction of the mind\n therefore he should pracit ise the khechari mudra\n then he attains to the state of unmani and falls into the yoga sleep trance \n to one who obtains this yoga sleep time does not exist\n placing the mind in the midst of sakti and sakti in the midst of the mind and looking on the mind with the mind o sandilya be happy\n place the atman in the midst of akasa and akasa in the midst of atman and having reduced everything to akasa do not think of anything else\n you should not then entertain youghts either external or internal\n abandoning all youghts become abstract yought itself\n as camphor in fire and salt in water become absorbed so also the mind becomes absorbed in the tattva truth \n what is termed manas mind is the knowledge of everything that is known and its clear apprehension\n when the knowledge and the object cognised are lost alike there is no second path or that is the only path \n by its giving up all cognition of objects it the mind is absorbed and when the mind is absorbed kaivalya isolation alone remains\n for the destruction of the chitta there are two ways yoga and jnana\n o prince of sages yoga is the forcible repression of the modifications of the mind and jnana is the thorough inquiry into them\n when the modifications of the mind are repressed it the mind verily obtains peace\n just as the actions of the people cease with the stopping of the fluctuations of the sun viz\n with sunset so when the fluctuations of the mind cease this cycle of births and deaths comes to an end\n then the fluctuations of prana are prevented when one has no longing for this mundane existence or when he has gratified his desires therein through the study of religious books the company of good men indifference to enjoyments practice and yoga or long contemplation with intentness on any desired higher object or through pracit ising one truth firmly\n by the repression of the breath through inhalation etc\n by continual practice therein which does not cause fatigue and by meditating in a secluded place the fluctuations of the mind are arrested\n through the right realisation of the true nature of the sound which is at the extreme end of the pronunciation of the syllable om viz\n ardhamatra and when sushupti dreamless sleeping state is rightly cognised through consciousness the fluctuations of prana are repressed\n when the passage at the root of the palate which is like the bell viz\n uvula is closed by the tongue with effort and when the breath goes up through the upper hole then the fluctuations of prana are stopped\n when the consciousness samvit is merged in prana and when through practice the prana goes through the upper hole into the dvadasanta the twelfth centre above the palate then the fluctuations of prana are stopped\n when the eye of consciousness viz\n the spiritual or third eye becomes calm and clear so as to be able to distinctly see in the transparent akasa at a distance of twelve digits from the tip of his nose then the fluctuations of prana are stopped\n when the youghts arising in the mind are bound up in the calm contemplation of the world of taraka star or eye between one s eyebrows and are thus destroyed then the fluctuations cease\n when the knowledge which is of the form of the knowable which is beneficent and which is untouched by any modifications arises in one and is known as om only and no other then the fluctuations of prana cease\n by the contemplation for a long time of the akasa which is in the heart and by the contemplation of the mind free from vasanas then the fluctuations of prana cease\n by these methods and various others suggested by one s yought and by means of the contact of the many spiritual guides the fluctuations cease\n having by contraction opened the door of kundalini one should force open the door of moksha\n closing with her mouth the door through which one ought to go the kundalini sleeps spiral in form and coiled up like a serpent\n he who causes this kundalini to move he is an emancipated person\n if this kundalini were to sleep in the upper part of the neck of any yogin it goes towards his emancipation\n if it were to sleep in the lower part of the body it is for the bondage of the ignorant\n leaving the two nadis ida and the other paingala it prana should move in the susumna\n that is the supreme seat of vishnu\n one should pracit ise control of breath with the concentration of the mind\n the mind should not be allowed by a clever man to rest on any other thing\n one should not worship vishnu during the day alone\n one should not worship vishnu during the night alone but should always worship him and should not worship him merely during day and night\n the wisdom producing opening near uvula has five passages\n o sandilya this is the khecharimudra pracit ise it\n with one who sits in the khechari mudra the vayu which was flowing before through the left and right nadis now flows through the middle one susumna\n there is no doubt about it\n you should swallow the air through the void susumna between ida and pingala\n in that place is khechari mudra situated and that is the seat of truth\n again that is khechari mudra which is situated in the akasa chakra in the head in the niralamba supportless seat between the sun and moon viz\n when the tongue has been lengthened to the length of a kala digit by the incision of the fraenum lingum and by rubbing and milking it viz\n the tongue fix the gaze between the two eyebrows and close the hole in the skull with the tongue reversed\n this is khechari mudra\n with the tongue and the chitta mind both move in the akasa khechari then the person with his tongue raised up becomes immortal\n firmly pressing the yoni perineum by the left heel stretching out the right leg grasping the feet with both hands and inhaling the air through the nostrils pracit ise kantha bandha retaining the air upwards\n by that all afflictions are destroyed then poison is digested as if it were nectar\n asthma splenetic disease the turning up of the anus and the numbness of the skin are removed\n this is the means of conquering prana and destroying death\n pressing the yoni by the left heel place the other foot over the left thigh inhale the air rest the chin on the chest contract the yoni and contemplate as far as possible your atman as situated within your mind\n thus is the direct perception of truth attained\n inhaling the prana from outside and filling the stomach with it centre the prana with the mind in the middle of the navel at the tip of the nose and at the toes during the sandhyas sunset and sunrise or at all times\n thus the yogin is freed from all diseases and fatigue\n by centring his prana at the tip of his nose he obtains mastery over the element of air by centring it at the middle of his navel all diseases are destroyed by centring it at the toes his body becomes light\n he who drinks the air drawn through the tongue destroys fatigue thirst and diseases\n he who drinks the air with his mouth during the two sandhyas and the last two hours of the night within three months the auspicious sarasvati goddess of speech is present in his vak speech viz\n he becomes eloquent and learned in his speech \n in six months he is free from all diseases\n drawing the air by the tongue retain the air at the root of the tongue\n the wise man thus drinking nectar enjoys all prosperity\n fixing the atman in the atman itself in the middle of the eyebrows having inhaled through ida and breaking through that centre thirty times even a sick man is freed from disease\n he who draws the air through the nadis and retains it for twenty four minutes in the navel and in the sides of the stomach becomes freed from disease\n he who for the space of a month during the three sandhyas sunset sunrise and midnight or noon draws the air through the tongue pierces thirty times and retains his breath in the middle of his navel becomes freed from all fevers and poisons\n he who retains the prana together with the mind at the tip of his nose even for the space of a muhurta forty eight minutes destroys all sins that were committed by him during one hundred births\n through the samyama of tara om he knows all things\n by retaining the mind at the tip of his nose he acquires a knowledge of indra world below that he acquires a knowledge of agni fire world\n through the samyama of chitta in the eye he gets a knowledge of all worlds in the ear a knowledge of yama the god of death world in the sides of the ear a knowledge of nrriti world in the back of it the ear a knowledge of varuna world in the left ear a knowledge of vayu world in the throat a knowledge of soma moon world in the left eye a knowledge of shiva world in the head a knowledge of atala world in the feet a knowledge of vitala world in the ankles a knowledge of nitala rather sutala world in the calves a knowledge of sutala rather talatala world in the knees a knowledge of mahatala world in the thighs a knowledge of rasatala world in the loins a knowledge of talatala rather patala world in the navel a knowledge of bhur earth world in the stomach a knowledge of bhuvar world in the heart a knowledge of suvar world in the place above the heart a knowledge of mahar world in the throat a knowledge of jana world in the middle of the brows a knowledge of tapa world in the head a knowledge of satya world\n by conquering dharma and adharma one knows the past and the future\n by centring it on the sound of every creature a knowledge of the cry or language of the animal is produced\n by centring it on the sanchita karma past karma yet to be enjoyed a knowledge of one s previous births arises in him\n by centring it on the mind of another a knowledge of the mind or youghts of others is induced\n by centring it on the kaya rupa or form of the body other forms are seen\n by fixing it on the bala strength \n the strength of persons like hanuman is obtained\n by fixing it on the sun a knowledge of the worlds arises\n by fixing it on the moon a knowledge of the constellation is produced\n by fixing it on the dhruva polar star a perception of its motion is induced\n by fixing it on his own self one acquires the knowledge of purusha on the navel he attains a knowledge of the kaya vyuha mystical arrangement of all the particles of the body so as to enable a person to wear out his whole karma in one life on the well of the throat freedom from hunger and thirst arises on the kurma nadi which is situated in the well of the throat a firmness of concentration takes place\n by fixing it on the tara pupil of the eye he obtains the sight of the siddhas spiritual personages \n by conquering the akasa in the body he is able to soar in the akasa in short by centring the mind in any place he conquers the siddhis appertaining to that place\n then comes pratyahara which is of five kinds\n it is the drawing away of the organs from attaching themselves to the objects of senses\n contemplating upon everything that one sees as atman is pratyahara\n renouncing the fruits of one s daily actions is pratyahara\n turning away from all objects of sense is pratyahara\n dharana in the eighteen important places mentioned below is pratyahara viz\n the feet the toes the ankles the calves the knees the thighs the anus the penis the navel the heart the well of the throat the palate the nose the eyes the middle of the brows the forehead and the head in ascending and descending orders\n then comes dharana\n it is of three kinds viz\n fixing the mind in the atman bringing the external akasa into the akasa of the heart and contemplating the five murit is forms of devatas in the five elements earth apas fire vayu and akasa\n it is of two kinds saguna with gunas or quality and nirguna wiyout quality \n saguna is the meditation of a murti\n nirguna is on the reality of self\n samadhi is the union of the jivatma individual self and the paramatman higher self wiyout the threefold state viz\n the knower the known and the knowledge \n it is of the nature of extreme bliss and pure consciousness\n thus ends the first chapter\n chapter ii then the brahma rishi sandilya not obtaining the knowledge of brahman in the four vedas approached the lord atharvan and asked him what is it teach me the science of brahman by which i shall obtain that which is most excellent\n atharvan replied o sandilya brahman is satya vijnana and ananta in which all this world is interwoven warp wise and woof wise from which all originated and into which all are absorbed and which being known makes everything else known\n it is wiyout hands and feet wiyout eyes and ears wiyout tongue or wiyout body and is unreachable and undefinable\n from which vak speech and mind return being unable to obtain or reach it\n it is to be cognised by jnana and yoga\n from which prajna of old sprang\n that which is one and non dual that which pervades everything like akasa which is extremely subtle wiyout a blemish actionless sat be ness only the essence of the bliss of consciousness beneficent calm and immortal and which is beyond\n know that by wisdom\n he who is the one the shining the giver of the power of atman the omniscient the lord of all and the inner soul of all beings who lives in all beings who is hidden in all beings and the source of all beings who is reachable only through yoga and who creates supports and destroys everything he is atman\n know the several worlds in the atman\n do not grieve o knower of atman you shalt reach the end of pains\n thus ends the second chapter\n chapter iii then sandilya questioned atharvan thus from the brahman that is om imperishable actionless beneficial sat be ness only and supreme how dissolution this universe arise how does it exist in it and how is it absorbed in it please solve me this doubt\n atharvan replied the supreme brahman the truth is the imperishable and the actionless\n then from the formless brahman three forms or aspects arose viz\n nishkala partless sakala with parts and sakala nishkala with and wiyout parts \n that which is satya vijnana and ananda that which is actionless wiyout any impurity omnipresent extremely subtle having faces in every direction undefinable and immortal that is his nishkala aspect\n maheshvara the great lord who is black and yellow rules with avidya mula prakriti or maya that is red white and black and that is co existent with him\n this is his sakala nishkala aspect\n then the lord desired or willed by his spiritual wisdom thus may i become many may i bring forth then from this person who was contemplating and whose desires are fulfilled three letters sprang up\n three vyahriit is the three footed gayatri the three vedas the three devas the three varnas colours or castes and the three fires sprang\n that supreme lord who is endowed with all kinds of wealth who is all pervading who is situated in the hearts of all beings who is the lord of maya and whose form is maya he is brahma he is vishnu he is rudra he is indra he is all the devas he is all the bhutas elements or beings he only is before he only is behind he only is on our left he only is on our right he only is below he only is above he only is the all\n that form of him as dattatreya who sports with his sakti who is kind to his devotees who is brilliant as fire resembling the petals or a red lotus and is of four hands who is mild and shines sinlessly this is his sakala form\n then sandilya questioned atharvan o lord that which is sat only and the essence of the bliss of consciousness why is he called parabrahmaan atharvan replied because he increases brihati and causes to increase everything brimhayati so he is called parabrahmaan\n why is he called atman since he obtains apnoti everything since he takes back everything and since he is everything so he is called atman\n who is he called maheshvara the great lord since by the sound of the words mahat isha the great lord and by his own power the great lord governs everything\n why is he called dattatreya because the lord being extremely pleased with atri rishi who was performing a most difficult penance and who had expressed his desire to see him who is light itself offered himself datta as their son and because the woman anasuya was his mother and atri was his father\n therefore he who knows the secret meaning knows everything\n he who always contemplates on the supreme that it is himself becomes a knower of brahman\n here these shlokas stanzas occur to he who contemplates always the lord of lords and the ancient thus as dattatreya the beneficent the calm of the colour of sapphire one who delights in his own maya and the lord who has shaken off everything as naked and as one whose whole body is besmeared with the holy ashes who has matted hair who is the lord of all who has four arms who is bliss in appearance whose eyes are like full blown lotus who is the store of jnana and yoga who is the spiritual instructor of all the worlds and who is dear to all the yogins and one who is merciful towards his devotees who is the witness of all and who is worshipped by all the siddhas is freed from all sins and will attain the spirit \n om satyam truth \n thus ends the third chapter\n om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the sandilya upanishad included in the atharva veda",
    "Paingala": "om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me then indeed paingala approached yajnavalkya as a disciple and having served him for twelve years said instruct me in regard to the supreme mystery of aloneness\n the eminent yajnavalkya replied dear one in the beginning this indeed existed\n it was the eternally free immutable everlastingly one secondless brahman full of truth knowledge and bliss\n in it existed the primordial and indefinable prakriti consisting of gunas in a state of equipoise red white and dark resembling the existence of water silver a man and outlines respectively in the mirage oyster shell a stump and a mirror what was reflected in it was the witness consciousness\n having been modified with the preponderance of sattva and named avyakta the unmanifest it prakriti became the power of concealment\n what was reflected in it became god consciousness\n he has maya under his control is omniscient is the initial cause of creation sustenance and dissolution of the world and has the form of the sprouting world\n he manifests the entire world dissolved in him\n due to the power of the karmas of living beings is the world spread out like this cloth and due to their exhaustion again is the world concealed\n in him alone does the entire world exist as a folded cloth\n from the power of concealment controlled by god arose the power of projection called mahat\n what is reflected in it is the consciousness of hiranyagarbha\n he has the conceit of ownership as regards mahat and has a body partly manifest and partly unmanifest\n from the projective power controlled by hiranyagarbha arose the gross power called the ego with the preponderance of tamas\n what was reflected in it was the consciousness of virat\n that virat who has conceit in the ego a manifest body and is the chief person vishnu is the protector of all gross things\n from that self virat arose ether from the ether air from air fire from fire water from water earth\n these five root elements are composed of the three gunas\n desiring to create that world cause god controlling the quality of tamas sought to render the subtle root elements gross\n he bifurcated each of the extremely limited elements and again made the halves four fold and added each of the five halves to one eighths of the other four\n with those quintuplicated elements he created endless crores of macrocosms and for each of these fourteen appropriate worlds and globular gross bodies fit for each planes of them all\n having divided into four the rajas part of the five elements he made prana with its five fold activity from three parts of it\n from the fourth part of rajas he fashioned the organ of action\n having divided into four their sattva part out of the combination of three of them he made the inner organ with its five fold activity\n from the fourth he made the organs of cognition\n from the combination of sattva he made the guardians of sense organs\n he cast them having created them into the macrocosm\n due to his command conjured with the ego the virat protected the gross elements of the cosmos \n commanded by him hiranyagarbha protected the subtle ones\n in the cosmos they could not wiyout god pulsate or act\n he desired to vivify them\n splitting open the macrocosm the channels of brahman and the crowns of individuals he entered into them\n though they were inert like sentient beings they performed each its own functions\n the omniscient lord conjoined with a streak of maya on entering the individual bodies and deluded by it became the jiva due to self identification with the three bodies he became both agent and reaper of action s fruits \n possessing the attributes of wakefulness dream deep sleep swoon and death like a chain of buckets attached to a water wheel he becomes troubled and as it were is born and dies revolving like a potter s wheel\n now paingala asked yajnavalkya how did the omnipotent lord of all worlds the author of their manifestation sustenance and dissolution become jiva yajnavalkya replied i shall speak distinguishing between the forms of the jiva and of god following the generation of the gross subtle and causal bodies\n listen with exclusive attention\n employing parts of quintuplicated gross elements the lord made individual and collective gross bodies respectively\n earyour are the skull skin intestines bones flesh and nails\n watery are the blood urine saliva perspiration and so forth\n fiery are hunger thirst heat lassitude sexual union etc\n airy are the movements the transporting breathing etc\n ethereal are lust anger etc\n the gross body with skin etc\n is a combination of all this fashioned through deeds it is the basis of states like childhood etc\n conceit and numerous failings\n then he god manifested prana the principle of life from the non quintuplicated aggregate of the three rajas parts of the gross elements\n the modification of the life principle are the prana apana vyana udana and samana\n the subordinate functions of prana are named naga kurma krikara devadatta and dhananjaya\n their bases are the heart the anus navel throat and all the limbs\n with the fourth part of the rajas of akasa he manifested the organ of action\n its functions are performed by the tongue the hands the feet the anus and the generative organ\n the objects of these are speech grasping movement excretion and sex enjoyment\n similarly from the aggregate of the three sattva parts of the elements he manifested the inner organ\n its functions are the mind the intellect yought and the ego\n the objects of these are imagination determination memory conceit and investigation\n their bases are the throat the mouth the navel the heart and the junction of the eye brows\n with the fourth part of the sattva of the elements he manifested the sense of cognition\n its functions are the ears the skin the eyes the tongue and the nose\n their objects are sound touch form taste and smell\n the overlords of the organs of perception and action are the directions the wind the sun prachetas asvins fire indra upendra death the moon vishnu brahma and sambhu\n now there are five sheaths that of food of vital breaths of mind of knowledge and of bliss\n the sheath of food comes into being from the essence of food alone develops by it and is dissolved in the earth that is predominantly of the nature of food\n that alone is the gross body\n the five breaths prana etc\n together with the five organs of actions constitute the sheath of vital breaths\n the sheath of mind is the mind together with the organs of cognition\n the sheath of knowledge is the intellect together with the organs of cognition\n these three sheaths constitute the subtle body\n the sheath of bliss is the knowledge of one s essence\n this is the causal body\n the eight fold city the total subtle body consists of the five organs of cognition the five organs of action the five breaths the five elements like ether etc\n the five fold inner organ desire action and tamas\n vishva is the self of knowledge a reflection of sat the empirical being having conceit in the gross body of the waking state\n the field of actions or born of actions is also a name of vishva\n by god s command the sutratman hiranyagarbha entered the subtle body of the individual and supervising the mind became the taijasa\n taijasa is the appearance\n dream fashioned is a name of taijasa\n by god s command the self with the adjunct of maya together with the unmanifest entering the individual causal body became prajna\n the prajna is undifferentiated real having conceit in deepsleep is the name of prajna\n texts like tattvamasi declare the identity with brahman of the real jiva concealed by ignorance and part of the unmanifest not of the other two the empirical and the illusory jivas in the waking and dream state \n the consciousness reflected in the inner organ participated in the three states\n merged in the states of wakefulness dream and deep sleep like a chain of buckets attached to the water wheel and afflicted he the jiva is as it were born and dead\n now there are five states wakefulness dream deep sleep swoon and death\n the wakeful state consists in the cognition of objects like sound etc\n by means of the organs of cognition like ears etc\n when aided by the respective guardian deities\n the jiva stationed at the junction of the eye brows and pervading the whole body from the foot to the head becomes the agent of all kinds of activities like tilling and heaving\n also the reaper of their respective fruits\n migrating to the other world s alone he reaps the fruit of his activities\n tired due to activities like an emperor he takes to the way leading to the inner chamber a new body \n when the instruments of cognition and action cease to operate the dream state comes into being in which there is knowledge of objects and their cognition due to the half awakened impressions of the waking state\n there vishva himself due to the cessation of empirical activities moving in the system of nerves and becoming taijasa enjoys freely the rarity of the world consisting of latent impressions which he illumines with his light\n the instrument of deep sleep is mind alone\n just as a bird exhausted by random flights folds its wings and moves towards its nest so the jiva too sporting in the spheres of wakefulness and dream and exhausted plunges into ignorance and enjoys its own bliss\n the state of swoon is like that of death with the sense organs stirring due to fear and unconsciousness when struck with a club stick etc\n different from the states of wakefulness dream deep sleep and swoon and occasioning fear to all jivas from brahma down to a clump of grass etc\n and resulting in the fall of the body is the state of death\n withdrawing the organs of action and cognition and the vital breaths corresponding to varied objects and attended by desires and actions and enveloped in ignorance and the subtle elements the jiva goes to another world\n due to the ripening of the fruits of prior actions like a worm caught up in a whirl pool the jiva now wins rest\n as a result of past good deeds at the end of many lives men seek liberation\n then resorting to a teacher of self realization and faithfully serving him long one inquiries into bondage and liberation\n bondage results from lack of inquiry liberation results from inquiry\n therefore investigate at all times\n one s own nature may be determined through superimposition and its repudiation\n therefore always inquire into the nature of the individual self and the supreme self\n when the state of jiva and that of the world are sublated brahman alone non different from the inner self remains\n then paingala said to yajnavalkya set forth the explanation of the major text s mahavakyas \n yajnavalkya replied thou art that thou that art thou brahman art i am brahman one should meditate thus\n the expressed sense of the word tat is the world cause marked by other ness mediacy having being consciousness and bliss as his characteristics maya as his adjunct and omniscience etc\n the very same with awareness mixed up with the inner sense the object of the inotion is the expressed meaning of tvam \n rejecting the adjuncts of the supreme god and the jiva viz\n maya and avidya the indicated sense of tat and tvam is brahman non different from the inner self\n hearing is investigation into the import of propositions like that thou art and i am brahman \n reflection is the exclusive dwelling on the content of what has been heard\n meditation is the fixing of the mind one pointedly on the reality made doubtless through investigation and reflection\n concentration resembling a flame in a windless spot is the yought chitta whose content is solely the object meditated exclusive of the agent and the act of meditation\n then mind s modifications referring to the self yough shooting up remain uncognised they are only inferred from memory\n by this samadhi alone are dissolved crores of deeds accumulated in the course of beginningless transmigratory existence\n through skilful practice thence then flow in a yousand ways streams of nectar\n therefore the best knowers of yoga call this concentration dharmamegha cloud of virtues\n when the meshes of latent impressions are entirely obliterated by virtue of it and the accumulation of deeds good and evil pulled up by their roots the proposition whose content was earlier mediated on generates unimpeded and immediate realization resembling in its certitude the gooseberry in the palm of one s hand \n then one becomes liberated in life\n god desired the non quintuplication of the quintuplicated elements\n leading the effected macrocosm and the worlds included in it to their causal state unifying the subtle organs of action vital breaths organs of cognition and the four fold inner sense reducing all elemental effects to the fivefold cause he dissolves in due order the earth in water water in fire fire in air air in ether ether in the ego the ego in the mahat the mahat in the unmanifest and the unmanifest in the spirit purusha \n due to the dissolution of the adjuncts virat hiranyagarbha and god are dissolved in the supreme self\n having become non quintuplicated through the attenuation of the accumulated deeds and the ripening of good deeds and one with the subtle body returning to the cause and its cause the gross body generated by deeds done through the quintuplicated gross elements becomes non quintuplicated and gets dissolved in the immutable inner self\n vishva taijasa and prajna dissolve in the same due to the dissolution of their adjuncts\n the microcosm consumed in the fire of knowledge together with its causes is dissolved in the supreme self\n therefore the brahmana should concentratedly dwell on the identity of the contents of the terms tat and tvam\n thence when the clouds are dispelled as the sun shines forth the self is manifested\n meditating on the self of the size of a thumb in the centre of the heart like a smokeless flame meditate on the illumining self in the centre immutable and immortal\n the silent sage liberated in life sits meditating till sleep till death he is the blessed one who has performed his duty\n giving up the status of liberation in life when one s body is consumed by time he reaches the status of disembodied liberation like the wind becoming stirless\n that immortal and certain one devoid of sound touch form taste or smell wiyout beginning and end beyond the mahat alone remains wiyout impurity and suffering\n then paingala asked yajnavalkya how does a knower jnanin act how does he stay in repose yajnavalkya replied one seeking liberation having acquired freedom from egoit ism etc\n takes generations of his ancestors and descendants across the sea of samsara \n the knower of brahman by himself alone does so generations\n know the self to be the rider in the chariot the body verily to be the chariot the intellect to be the charioteer and the mind to be the reins\n the senses the wise say are the horses the objects are what they range over the hearts are the moving many storeyed mansions\n the great sages aver that the self combined with sense organs and mind is the experiencer\n therefore in the heart immediately is narayana well established\n upto the exhaustion of the operative deeds the homeless liberated self behaves like the slough of a snake like the moon in the sky \n shedding the body in a holy spot or may be in the home of an eater of dog s flesh the liberated one attains isolation\n afterwards make an offering of his body to the cardinal points or bury his body \n mendicancy is prescribed for the male never for the other\n no observance of the period of pollution no burning of the corpse no offering of rice balls or of water no fortnightly rites are laid down for a mendicant who has become brahman\n there is no burning of what is already consumed just as there is no cooking of what is already cooked\n for one whose body is consumed in the fire of knowledge there is neither ceremonial rice offering nor any other rite of obsequies \n as long as the adjuncts body etc\n persist let one wait upon the teacher\n let him treat the wife of the teacher and his children as he does the teacher himself\n when with the knowledge i am that i am that i whose mind is pure essence is pure spirit is long suffering wisdom is won when the object of knowledge the supreme self is established in the heart when the body is dissolved in the state of achieved peace then one becomes destitute of the luminous mind and intellect\n of what use is water to one who has had his fill of ambrosia similarly for one who has known his self of what use are the vedas no duty remains for the yogin who has had his fill of the ambrosia of knowledge\n if duty be there he is no knower of truth\n though stationed at a distance he is not distant yough embodied he is disembodied he is the omnipresent inner self\n making the heart pure contemplating the well being of all one must experience supreme joy in the yought i am the supreme the all \n as there is non difference when water is poured in water milk in milk and ghee in ghee so is the case with the individual self and the supreme self\n when the body is burned by knowledge and knowledge becomes infinite in form then the knower consumes the bondage of karma in the fire of brahman knowledge\n thence follows the state of the holy non dual reality named the supreme lord like unto the stainless sky\n self s nature abiding wiyout adjuncts is as that of water mixed with water\n like the ether the self in the subtle body\n the inner self like air is not perceived\n that stirless inner self perceives the external manifold with the torch of objective knowledge\n the knower dead no matter due to whatever form of death is dissolved in brahman that is like the all pervasive sky\n this dissolution he knows in truth as of the pot space in the infinite space \n he attains the status of the self sustained light of all pervasive knowledge\n standing on one foot let man do austerities for a years but that austerity is less than one sixteenth of this yoga of meditation\n this is knowledge this is to be known one wishes to know all that\n were he to live even for a years he would not reach the end of the shastras\n what should be known is just the imperishable but life is fleeting\n avoiding the labyrinths of shastras meditate on the truth alone \n action are endless purification mutterings of holy names sacrifices pilgrimage to holy places\n these are valid only till truth is won\n as regards the great souled ones the sure cause of liberation is the knowledge i am brahman \n the two words determining bondage and liberation are mine and not mine \n the import of mine binds the living being he is liberated by that of not mine \n when the mind is dementalised no longer is duality cognised\n when dementalisation is achieved that becomes the supreme status\n wherever then the mind goes there verily is the supreme status\n thus there everywhere is brahman well established\n for one who holds i am not brahman no liberation is possible it is as futile as striking the sky with clenched fists or a hungry man s chewing the chaff\n whoso studies the upanishad as a rule every day is purified by fire as it were by air by the sun by vishnu by rudra\n he has bathed in all sacred waters\n he is versed in all the vedas has performed all the sacred rites taught by all the vedas\n he has ritually muttered lacs of itihasas and puranas and one lac times rudra s tantras \n he has muttered a million times the sacred syllable om\n he redeems ten generations of his line past and future\n he purifies the rows of diners of which he is a number\n he is purged of the sins of brahmin slaughter drink stealth adultery with even a teacher s spouse and of association with those who are guilty of these\n that supreme status of vishnu spread out like an eye in the sky the enlightened ones always behold\n the wise ever vigilant and diligent in praise richly glorify that supreme status of vishnu\n om truth this is the secret teaching\n om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the paingalopanishad belonging to the sukla yajur veda",

be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me then we shall expound the mahopanishad\n they say narayana was alone\n there were not brahma shiva waters fire and soma heaven and earth stars sun and moon\n he could not be happy\n from the desire of the paramatman the yajnastoma hymn known as avyakta is said to have arisen\n in it arose fourteen purushas brahman vishnu rudra isana sadashiva and nine prajapait is like daksha one maiden mula prakriti the ten organs five of perception and five of action mind as the eleventh bright intellect as the th ego as the th prana as th atma as th buddhi kama karma and tamas five tanmatras along with gross elements and the being was the th sutratman \n employing him in creation the supreme being remained detached\n from him do all things come into being\n again narayana desiring something else yought\n from his forehead a person arose with three eyes and a trident having glory fame truth celibacy austerity detachment mind lordship seven vyahriit is bhur etc\n along with pranava rik and other vedas all metres is his body so he is the great lord\n then again desiring something else he yought from his forehead sweat fell and became the wide waters from it a bright golden egg in it was born the four headed brahma facing east\n narayana became the vyahriti bhur the chandas gayatri the rig veda and the deity agni\n facing west he became bhuvar the chandas tristubh the yajur veda and deity vayu\n facing north he became vyahriti suvar jagati chandas sama veda and the deity surya\n facing south he became mahar chandas anustubh atharva veda and soma\n meditate upon the god of a yousand heads and eyes source of cosmic well being beyond all eternal narayana the universe subsists in him\n like a lotus calyx the human heart hangs down dripping drops of cold water for sustaining life\n in its midst is a great flame facing everywhere subtle and facing upwards the great being is present he is brahma shiva indra undying and self shining\n suka of great lustre devoted to natural bliss the prince of sages realised truth even at birth wiyout instruction \n so also a person may get certain knowledge of the self by himself by long selfanalysis\n this is because the self is beyond description un realisable by worldly means by the mind and the sense organs pure bliss atomic subtler then even ether\n the millions of particles undergo generation subsistence and dissolution inside the supreme being by rotation of the power\n the supreme being is ether because there is nothing outside it and yet not the ether because it is all pure consciousness it is nothing which can be pointed out specified such and such as a thing reality etc\n he is conscious being lustrous yet like rock because he cannot be normally known causing the picture like awakening existence of the world in himself the pure ether\n this cosmos is only the manifestation of that being there is nothing other than that the differences in the universe are also his manifestation\n present everywhere connected with every thing yet he does not move as there is nowhere to go he does not exist as there is nowhere substratum to exist yet exists because he is existence by nature\n brahman is knowledge bliss and the resort source of the giver of jivanmukti\n giving up of all mental desires is the way to that knowledge \n the wise say that the understanding of that being is the absence of worldly conceptions\n the dissolution and creation of the universe are due to the contraction and expansion respectively of the power\n the basis of vedantic statements yet beyond words it is i reality knowledge bliss and nothing else \n suka knew all this by his own subtle intellect then remained with his mind ceaselessly rapt in it\n he did not have the conception that the atman is real his mind simply turned away from worldly temptations the many material worldly enjoyments which break very much like the sait isfied chataka bird from torrent water\n he knew all but out of respect for tradition passed at this stage \n once suka of pure knowledge asked with devotion of his father vyasa the seer seated alone at meru mountain o seer how did this elaborate pomp of worldly life arise how does this become dissolved how much and when being thus asked vyasa instructed everything to his son\n having already known all this suka did not value the verbal statement\n sage vyasa knowing the son s yought said i do not know the truth you can know all from janaka the king of mithila who knows it correctly\n being told this suka went from there to the earth and the city of videha ruled by janaka\n he was announced to janaka by the ushers o king suka the son of vyasa waits at the entrance \n desiring of knowing suka janaka said let him wait and tarried for seven days\n then he permitted him into the court and janaka regaled suka with women and other luxuries\n they did not attract suka just as gentle breeze cannot shake a mountain\n he simply remained pure like the full moon equable silent and composed\n janaka looked at him and bowed knowing his nature\n he said you have adjured all worldly actions and for all your desires what more do you desire suka replied this grandiose world how did this arise and how dissolved janaka narrated all correctly the same as was spoken by father vyasa\n i myself knew this already the same was told to me by my father also by you most eloquent speaker this is also the matter seen in the shastras\n the mass of mental fancies dies away by the death of the fancies worldly life is also buried away this is certain\n so great armed janaka pray tell me the truth firmly the world gets peace for the reeling mind from you \n janaka replied o suka listen to what i speak the details of knowledge the essence of wisdom by knowing which one can get the status of liberation in life \n when there is generated a wiping away of visible phenomena by the mind realizing that there is no real visible object then arises the great joy of nirvana extinction liberation \n the best total adjuration of mental impressions tendencies is said by the good people to be liberation it is a pure procedure whereas those people whose tendencies are not given up but purified not subject to the danger of re birth these wise ones are said to be the enlightened liberated in life\n strong intense brooding over objects is said to be bondage its thinning out is oh brahman liberation\n he is said to be liberated while living who has lost taste for enjoyment by means of penance etc\n and no other cause\n who does not rejoice nor languish being detached when joy and grief befall him according to time destiny who is untouched in the mind by exaltation anger fear lust and meanness who gives up as if playfully the egoit ist tendency and remains giving up brooding who is free from desire and non desire as he is introvert and behaves as in deep sleep who is seated delighting in the spirit replete pure in mind having got excellent repose and desires nothing in the material world and lives wiyout unction who is un smeared in the region of the heart with objects of knowledge and whose consciousness is not inert who performs wiyout expectation likes and dislikes actions acts of joy and grief virtue and vice success and failure who is silent egoless prideless avoiding jealousy and does actions wiyout agitation who exists like a detached onlooker and functions wiyout attachment and desire everywhere who has given up internally all of dharma and

and grief death and birth who free from tension and joy does not get depressed or elated with a pure intellect who has given up all desires all doubts all conation all rigid youghts who is equal

is aspect less having mind yet mindless\n who is active towards all objects yet is desireless as if they are alien objects is full in spirit\n he gives up the state of jivanmukta when this body is consigned to time death and enters the state of adehamukta liberated wiyout body like wind which does not move\n such a person does not rise or set is neither real nor unreal nor is he far away nor i nor another \n other than him there is no lustres nor darkness which is steady and profound ineffable and unmanifest\n not empty vacuum not having form neither visible nor vision nor a mass of creations but existing infinitely\n undesignated in nature fuller than the fullest neither real nor unreal neither being nor coming into being pure consciousness not the chaitya world created by mind endless ageless auspicious having no beginning middle or end having no ailment in mind or body\n that which is considered as the vision amidst the seer seeing and object of seeing\n o sage there is surely nothing beyond this\n it is known by yourself as well as heard from a preceptor one is bound by one s own fancy and released by being rid of it detachment towards enjoyment of all visible external objects has arisen in you all that is to be got has been got by you with a perfect mind you feel erred in regard to your own nature but now being liberated give up error you see that you are brahman itself beyond what is external and internal you see but you do not see you are the sole and perfect onlooker uninvolved \n suka reposed silently passively in the supreme being in the own normal state devoid of grief fear and strain\n then he went to the peak of meru mountain unimpeded for trance\n there for yousands of years he remained in unqualified trance and attained rest in himself like a flame wiyout oil\n purified of the blemish of manifold yought in the pristine and pure condition he became one with all worldly tendencies melting away like water drop in the ocean\n a lad nidagha prince of seers and enlightened permitted by his father to go on a pilgrimage had ablution in three and a half crores of sacred places then told ribhu about himself\n after bathing in so many places an enquiry question has arisen there in my mind the world is born only to die and dies only to be reborn all the actions of the moving and unmoving things are ephemeral things such are sources of splendour are sinful and give place to all calamities unconnected with each other like iron stakes they come together only by mental fancy\n i have lost taste in various things like a traveller in deserts my mind is tormented as to how this suffering will die down riches please me not but give only cycles of worries just as houses with children and women cause danger\n this material glory in the world is delicate cause only delusion does not give happiness\n life is unsteady like a drop of water hanging on to the top of a tender leaf like an insane person it goes away leaving the body suddenly\n life causes strain to those whose mind is shattered by contact with the poison from the snake of worldly objects and who lack mature discrimination of the self\n it is possible reasonable to envelop wind and to cut into empty space to string together watery waves but not give up attachment to worldly life\n in contrast by attaining brahman what is to be got is got which causes no grief it is the place of highest joy\n even trees live so do animals and birds only he really lives whose mind is sustained by contemplation the others who have no spiritual rebirth are only old donkeys\n shastra is a burden to one who lacks spiritual discrimination knowledge is a burden to one attached to life mind is a burden to one wiyout security body is a burden to one ignorant of the self\n from ego does danger arise so do bad mental ailments and desire there is no enemy more dangerous than ego whatever in the moving and unmoving world was enjoyed by ego all that is unreal only freedom from ego is real\n the mind runs hither and tither in vain and with zeal like a dog in the village\n o brahman i have been made inert by the pursuit of thirst and eaten by my mind as by a dog\n containment of the mind is impossible even by drinking up the ocean uprooting meru and eating fire\n mind is the cause of objects when it exists the three worlds exist when it does not so do they so it should be cured with effort\n whatever wealth of merit i acquire that thirst cuts down like a mouse cutting a string\n thirst is a fickle monkey it sets foot in impassable places hankers after fruits even when filled with them never rests long in a place\n throat is a bee in the lotus heart\n one moment it goes to patala another the sky and another it hovers in the bush of space of all the griefs of worldly life only thirst gives the longest grief a person wellguarded in the harem it involves in great trouble\n abandonment of brooding is the preventive chant for the cholera of thirst\n there is nothing as pitiable as the body low and meritless it exults over a little and suffers over a little\n the body is the great abode of the house holder i\n let it roll about or be steady what is it to me o preceptor this body pleases me not the senses animals are bound by six ropes vices in its yard ego leaps about it is crowded with the servants the mind\n it is frightening with the entrance held by the monkey tongue in it are seen the bared teeth and bones\n tell me what is attractive in the body which is made of blood and flesh in and out and which is only to perish let him trust the body who sees steadiness in lightnings autumn clouds and cities in the sky illusions \n childhood is the abode of fear from the teacher mother father other people and older children\n one is overwhelmed by the goblin of lust which exists in the cave of one s mind and causes many delusions\n slaves sons women relatives and friends laugh at a man shaken by old age as at a mad man\n desire is full of the defect of helplessness grows long in old age the sole friend of all danger and confuse foment is the heart\n the attribution of happiness to worldly life even this is cut by time like grass by a rat\n time tries to possess selfishly every thing from grass and dust to indra and gold which is the dust of meru destroys all and all the three worlds are occupied by it\n what is auspicious about woman a puppet of flesh moved by a machine in the cage of the body having nerves bones and knots why are you deluded separate the skin flesh blood and tears and then look at the body\n is it attractive the pearl necklace on the breast is like the current of ganga on meru fleeting and ephemeral the same breast is eaten by dogs at the due time like a lump of food in the cemetery and corners of the directions\n women are the flame of sin have the soot of hair pleasing to the eye but not to be touched they burn man like grass\n women are the fuel lovely yet harmful of the fires of all blazing at a distance whether they have taste attachment or not\n women are the traps to catch the birds men spread by the hunter manmatha the lump of bait the string of wickedness to men who are the fish in the pond of birth life and moving in the mud of mind\n i will have none of this woman who is the basket of all defects gems the chain of misery\n only he with a woman has desire for enjoyment where is enjoyment for one who has no woman giving up women means giving up the world by this one shall be happy\n even the quarters like north are not seen regions give other wrong instruction even the oceans and the stars dry up even the permanent becomes impermanent even yogins siddhas perish demons and others decay brahma is reduced to nothing the unborn vishnu too shiva becomes nonexistent the lords of the quarters decay\n brahma vishnu rudra and all classes of creatures run towards destruction like water streams towards the marine fire\n dangers come for a moment so does wealth birth and death are only for a moment everything dies\n the brave ones are killed by those not brave a hundred are killed by one\n poison changes its scope effect poison is not poison objects of the world destroy only one more birth poison destroys life only once it is time my mind is burnt in the forest fire of defects\n desires for enjoyment do not flash even in the illusory fatamorgana so oh preceptor waken me quickly with the knowledge of truth\n if you do not i shall take to silence wiyout pride and jealousy contemplating vishnu with the mind like one turned into a painting\n nidagha there is nothing else to be known by you you are the best of the of the enlightened you know by your intellect with god s grace i shall wipe away the error caused by the impurity of the mind control of inner and outer senses enquiry contentment and the fourth contact with good people resort to one at least of these giving up everything with all effort when one is achieved the others also are achieved\n one shall develop wisdom only at first first liberation from worldly life by means of scripture contact with good people penance and self control\n one s own experience of the self shastra and the preceptor form one statement they yield a single purpose by pracit ising the teachings of which the self is ever looked at realized \n if you do achieve every moment the avoidance of the sustained fancy and desire then you will have reached the sacred mindless state\n samadhi is said to be the freedom of the mind from agency activity \n that itself is oneness that is the highest and auspicious joy\n you should remain like a dumb blind and deaf person giving up with your mind the yought of all things as the self\n the vision got through words of vedanta that you are composed unborn beginningless and endless shining taste bliss alone devoid of symptoms of mind all this is for the lower knowledge and wasteful only om is real\n all the visible things in the world are nothing more than the consciousness wiyout vibration contemplate this\n or with mind ever enlightened and performing worldly functions you remain knowing the oneness of the self like the calm ocean\n only the knowledge of truth is the fire to the grass of mental impressions this is said to be samadhi not mere silence\n just as the world is active when the much desired sun has arisen mani gem of the day the sun so also do the creatures of the world when the supreme reality is present\n so oh sage the agentship and non agentship in the self arise the spirit is a non agent when there is no desire an agent by his mere presence\n these two exist in the supreme being agency and non agency resort to it firmly which is the ultimate cause of the two\n so by the youghts well kindled that i am always a non agent the remains only the state of equality called the supreme immortality\n listen o nidagha there are born in the world men of noble qualities in the nirvikalpa samadhi ever in the ascendant and happy like autumnal moons in the sky not depressed during danger like a gold lotus at night nor aspiring beyond what is destined delighting in the path of the good people\n they shine through this firm personality with merits in the friendship even minded and reconciled pleasing ever good in conduct\n they are within limits like the ocean placid in mind do not give up discipline like the sun\n a wise person should enquire fully what am i how did this blemish of samsara develop one should not take to wrong deeds nor live with a low person\n death the killer of all should not be looked up in mockery\n one should look only at the pure consciousness avoiding the body the bone flesh and blood which are inauspicious the consciousness being the string that holds together all the creatures like a necklace\n pursuing what is acceptable and avoiding totally what is not this is the proper nature attitude of the mind\n the seer shall be rid of grief knowing that he is brahman with his own realization by the path prescribed by the preceptor\n enlightenment arises in the state of detachment wherein the fall of a hundred sharp swords is borne like strokes with lilies burning with fire like drenching with snow charcoal like sandalwood endless fall of arrows like a fall of cool water to relieve summer heat cutting one s own head like happy sleep the deprivation of speech like silence deafness like a blessing\n the self as always observed by the practice of realization which arises from the instruction of the preceptor\n just as the directions once again as before the delusion so the world delusion goes away destroyed by knowledge consider this\n riches do not help nor friends nor kinsmen nor the strain of the body nor resorting to sacred waters and temples but only through the conquest of the mind is that condition reached\n all the miseries hankerings unbearable mental pain are lost in people with a calm mind like darkness in the sun\n all creatures subside attain calmness in a serene person like children mischievous or soft in their mother\n not by drinking elixirs nor by the embrace of wealth does a person get so much joy as by inner peace\n he is said to be a serene person who does not exult or feel depressed on hearing touching eating seeing and knowing the good or the bad\n whose mind is not agitated clear like the moon s disc in death festival as well as in battle\n only the serene person shines among ascetics knowers sacrificers kings men of strength and of virtue\n the calm persons are great who have attained contentment with the drink of amrita and delight in the self\n he is the contented one who gives up longing for what is not got and is even towards what is got not seeing i\n ignoring grief and joy who does not admire what is not got enjoys according to desire what is actually got and is benign in his conduct\n liberation while alive arises when the yought delights in what is got like a good woman in a harem and this gives the joy of the spirit s own nature\n the wise person should reflect about the path to liberation every moment in the manner of the shastras according to the place convenience and contact with good people until he achieves repose in the spirit\n a person having repose in the fourth state liberation and released from the ocean of worldly life whether he lives or not be he house holder or recluse has no purpose meaning in what is done or not done nor by the delusion of veda and smriti he remains in his pristine condition like the ocean wiyout being churned by the mountain he is in a transcendental state \n when there arises the pure realization of all as the spirit then shines the body in the form of the consciousness beyond origin space and time\n the visible cosmos of un moving and moving things melts away like dream in a dreamless sleep\n the wise people have attributed for empirical purposes names for the supreme being such as rita atma para brahma truth etc\n just as armlets etc\n are only words and meanings not different from gold so also is the magical illusion of the cosmos extended by the supreme being\n the perceived being inside the visible world is called bondage in the absence dissolution of the visible he is realized\n what is called the visible is the projection like the universe is you and i \n the illusion of the world is spread only by the mind as long as it happens this is no liberation\n the cosmos is spread generated through the mind by the self born supreme being\n so the visible cosmos is mental in nature\n there is no real mind it is only the flash of things\n know the mind to be only ideation\n understand that where there is ideation there is mind\n mind and ideation are never different when the mass of ideations slips away only the pristine nature remains\n when the excitement of the visible viz\n i and you are the cosmos dies down only the sole condition pristineness remains\n at the achievement of the great dissolution when all the visible creation etc\n known to be non existent only tranquillity remains\n there exists the unborn divine unailing shining being the unsetting sun forever the maker of all declared to be the supreme self\n from whom words turn away un reaching who is realized only by the liberated person whose names like individual selves are assumed not natural\n o great sage of the three kinds of ether space namely the mental spiritual and gross know the spiritual one to be emptier subtler than the other two\n when the perception passes from one place to another the interval is to be known as the spiritual region in a moment when you reach the stage where all ideations are rejected then surely you will reach the state of all quiet\n that condition state is samadhi which excludes bliss and contains the essence of detachment of nobility and beauty when joy arises strongly by the realization of the falseness of the visible world and like and dislike thin away\n this realization is indeed the knowledge and its object spiritual in nature only that is the sole state all else is false\n nidagha know the world to be an illusion airavata in rut is confined to a corner of a mustard a mosquito fights with groups of lions inside an atom meru put inside a lotus is pat out by a bee\n only the mind made impure by involvement etc\n the same mind is said to be the end of worldly existence when freed from them\n an embodied being attained that condition being brooded over by the mind freed from bodily tendencies it he is not smeared affected by the body s attributes\n i am that the mind which turns an aeon into a moment and vice versa\n one cannot attain realize truth wiyout desisting from bad conduct wiyout calmness and concentration but only through enlightenment\n one fears never and from nothing on knowing the nature of the self as bliss unequalled attributeless and one mass of truth and consciousness\n that is beyond all that is beyond greater than the greatest lustrous and eternal in nature wise ancient being worshipped by all gods\n as a rule i am brahman these two words are for the liberation of the great\n whereas not mine and mine give liberation and bondage respectively \n the creation of the world is assumed projected by god starting from the vision and ending with entry from generation to dissolution in the form of jiva ishvara etc\n the nature of the animate and the inanimate worldly life from waking to liberation is projected by jiva\n schools from the trinachiketa to the yoga depend on ishvara s illusion on the still lower level from the lokayata to sankhya the schools depend on jiva s illusion\n hence the aspirants to liberation should not consider these schools being illusory but the essential truth about brahman is to be considered with steadiness\n only one who looks upon everything in relation to consciousness is the knower proper shiva vishnu and brahma\n wiyout a good preceptor s grace it is hard to give up objects to see truth and to realize the pristine state\n the pristine state is naturally realized by a yogin who has power generated in him and has given up all worldly activity\n when a man perceives even a little difference between these then there will be fear for him doubtless\n a person with wisdom as the eye sees the supreme as present everywhere one wiyout wisdom does not like a blind man the sun\n the supreme being is knowledge alone so a mortal becomes immortal only by vision of brahman\n when the great beyond is seen the knot of the heart snaps all doubts are smashed and all worldly actions die away\n be devoted to samvid with single attention giving up the non spiritual attitude and unaffected by the condition of the world\n in a desert all the water in mirages is an illusion only the desert is real similarly on reflection all the three worlds are nothing more than chit\n he who remains giving up what is implied and expressed is shiva himself the best of the brahmanknowers\n that un decaying being is the substratum of all wiyout comparison beyond words and mind eternal omnipotent omnipresent and subtle\n the mind and the world are only the blooming of the supreme being worldly life is reduced by the restraint of the mind and non restraint of the spirit \n i shall tell you the means of curing mental ills giving up whatever object is attractive one attains liberation\n pity that worm of a man who cannot do this giving up which is absolutely good and dependent on oneself\n the auspicious path cannot be got wiyout subduing the mind which is giving up desires and which can be achieved by one s own effort\n when the mind is cut by the weapon of non projection then is achieved realized the brahman omnipresent and tranquil\n hold yourself un excited released from yought of worldly existence having great wisdom the swallowed controlled mind is the place of knowledge\n resorting to great effort making the mind non mind meditating in the heart with the edge of the wheel of consciousness\n kill the mind wiyout hesitation your internal enemies will not bind you\n i am he this is mine the mind is only so much this is cut down by the knife of non projection\n the mind is blown away only by the wind of non projection like the bank of clouds in the autumn sky\n let the winds of deluge blow let the oceans become one to destroy the world let all the twelve suns blaze the mind is not affected\n you remain intent upon that state of the empire of truth which can only be non projection and which gives all success\n nowhere is the mind seen to be wiyout fickleness it is the nature of mind just as heat is that of fire\n this power of pulsation existing as mind know this to be the power which is the ostentatious world\n the mind wiyout wavering is said to be amrita\n the same is said to be liberation in the shastraic doctrine\n this wavering which is another name for ignorance destroy this with reflection\n sinless one be free from projections vikalpas attaining that position with which the mind becomes united by means of human effort\n hence resorting to human effort possessing i\n controlling the mind with the mind be form and free from anxiety in the place wiyout grief\n only the mind can control the mind firmly who can control a king except another king for those grasped by the crocodile of desire and fallen into the ocean of worldly life and carried away tossed about by the whirlpools only the mind is the life boat\n break the mind with the mind the rope uplift yourself from worldly life which cannot be crossed by another\n whatever propensity called the mind arises from previous other impulses these a wise one is to avoid and from this there will be reduction of ignorance\n give up the tendency to differentiate giving up the instinct for worldly enjoyment then giving up both positive and negative tendencies be blissful wiyout mental projection\n the avoidance of desire towards whatever is seen is the destruction of the mind of ignorance\n freedom from desire is extinction liberation acceptance of desire is misery\n in the un enlightened people ignorance is seen to exist\n how can it exist in a person of sound wisdom being accepted only in name\n ignorance swings a person on the steep rocks of samsara having the thorny bushes of misery not when ignorance dies away leading to the desire for perception of the self reducing delusions\n when everything is seen this desire too melts away\n this ignorance is only desire its destruction is said to be liberation this results by the destruction of projections\n the intense darkness ignorance is reduced when in the sky of the mind the night of propensities fades away by the sight of the sun of consciousness\n the supreme lord is the ineffable conscious principle present every where and devoid of mental misery\n all this cosmos is brahman eternally conscious undecaying\n the other thing namely mental projections does not really exist\n nothing is really born dies in this triad of worlds nor is there any reality in various stages of things only pure consciousness is real which is aloof shining by itself common to all and free from mental torment\n when this is ever realized as pure untroubled serene calm and unchanging this mind realizes through reflection the mind is called so because of reflection\n so this yought caused by force is destroyed by resolution\n the mind is bound strongly by the resolution i am not brahman it is released by the resolve i am brahman it is bound by the concept in keeping with the yought i am lean bound by misery i have hands feet etc\n whereas it is released by the conviction following the yought i am not miserable i have no body the soul is not bound \n one is liberated when ignorance dies away by the internal conviction\n i am not the flesh the bones i am beyond the body \n this ignorance is due to imagination by conceiving the non spirit as spirit\n resorting to great effort with supreme resolve and abandoning desire at a distance be blissful wiyout fancy\n my son my wealth he is mine such propensity leaps about by the tangle of senses\n do not be ignorant be wise give up involvement is samsara why do you wail like an ignorant person by such attachment what is this body of yours dull dumb impure lump of flesh for which you are overpowered by worldly pleasure and pain it is strange that the true brahman is forgotten by people may you not be smeared by attachment when you are active\n strange also that mountains are bound by lotus fibre this universe is perturbed by the ignorance which is non existent mere grass has become adamant then i shall speak truly of the seven steps of ignorance seven of wisdom\n the stages between are countless and produced otherwise\n liberation is existence in natural spiritual condition lapse from it is the concept of i attributes like desire and hate born of ignorance are not for those who do not swerve from their nature as a result of the realization of pure consciousness\n the fall from spiritual nature the drowning of consciousness in mental matters there is no other delusion now or in future than this\n the existence in spiritual nature is said to be the destruction of mental activity being in the middle unaffected when the mind goes from object to object\n the existence supreme in nature is remaining like stone all ideation dying out free from waking and sleep\n that is one s own spiritual nature which is not inert the non pulsating placid mind when the egoaspect is dead\n waking in seed state simple waking great waking etc\n the seven fold delusion when these combine among themselves they become manifold hear of its nature\n the first stage is the consciousness undesirable pure condition taking the name of mind jiva etc\n which will come into existence\n waking existing as seed potential is said to be waking in seed this is the new or first condition of consciousness\n the waking state second after the new stage the subtle concept i mine arising purely this is waking non existent earlier\n the great waking the broad gross concept arising in a previous birth as i and mine \n the waking dream the kingdom of the mind which has developed or not as identifying one s self with these\n the dream state it is of many kinds arising from the waking state in the form of two moons shellsilver mirage etc\n the reflection by the awakened person this was seen only a short time it will not arise because of not seeing for long it is like the working state\n the dream waking state the inert condition of jiva giving up the six conditions\n the deep sleep is filled with the future misery in which condition the world is merged in darkness\n the seven stages have been spoken by me of ignorance each of these has hundreds of varieties with various splendours\n by knowing the seven stages of knowledge one will not be sub merged in the mire of illusions\n many schools speak variously of the stages of yoga but only the following are acceptable to me liberation follows after the seven stages\n the first stage of knowledge is auspicious desire the second is reflection the third is thinning of the mind the fourth is attainment of sattva then detachment the sixth is reflection on objects and the seventh is of the turiya\n their explanation the wise say that the auspicious desire is the desire following detachment meditation why do i remain like a fool being looked upon by good people reflection is good activity tendency after the practice of detachment and contact with scriptures and good people\n thinning of the mind is the condition where the attachment to sense objects is reduced by means of auspicious desire and reflection\n sattvapatti is the mind in the pure sattva condition by the practice of the above three stages\n the asamsakti stage is the developed condition wiyout even a trace of involvement by means of the practice of the four stages\n padarthabhavana is the sixth stage resulting from the five stages delighting in the spirit firmly by the non contemplation of objects internal and external\n the fourth transcendental condition here the seventh is concentration on one s nature seeing no real difference by the long practice of the six stages this is the stage of jivanmukti\n the stage beyond the fourth is the stage of liberation wiyout the body\n nidagha those who have reached the seventh stage delight in the spirit they do not drown in pleasure and pain\n they do or not do whatever is only relevant and minimal\n they perform actions following the past awakened impelled by those nearby like one waking from sleep\n these seven stages can be known only by the enlightened reaching which condition even animals barbarians etc\n are liberated with or wiyout the body surely\n wisdom indeed is the breaking of the knot and the liberation the dying of the illusion of mirage\n but those who have crossed the ocean of illusion they have reached the high position\n the means of calming the mind is said to be yoga\n this is to be known as having seven stages which lead to the status of brahman\n there there is no feeling of you and i one s own and another nor the perception of existence or non existence\n all is calm needing no support existing in the ether of the heart eternal auspicious devoid of ailment and illusion name and cause\n neither existent nor existent nor in between nor the negation of all beyond the grasp of mind and words fuller than the fullest more joyful than joy\n beyond worldly perception the limit of one s hope horizon extensive there is no existence of any thing other than pure cognition\n the body exists only when there is the relationship of the perceiver the perceived and the vision connecting them whereas this position of liberation is devoid of such relation of the distinct perceiver perception and object\n in between the movement of the mind from object to object there is the unqualified essence of intelligence\n this is immaterial perception reflection always identify yourself with that\n your eternal essence is devoid of states like wakefulness dream and deep sleep or equalities like intelligence and inertness always identify yourself with that\n excluding that heart of stone inertness always identify yourself with that which is beyond the mind\n discarding the mind in the far distance you see you are that which is be established as that\n first the mind was formed from the principle of the supreme self by the mind has this world with its multitudinous details been spread out\n wise men the nihil alluringly named shines forth from the nihil as the blue does from the sky\n when the mind is dissolved through the attenuation of mental constructions the mist of cosmic fancies will stand dissolved\n the one infinite unborn pristine and pure spirit shines forth within as the cloudless sky in autumn\n in the sky has sprung up a picture wiyout a painter or a basis i\n it has no perceiver it is one s own experience wiyout the medium of sleep or dream\n in the conscious self that is the witness common transparent and indisputable as a mirror are reflected all the worlds wiyout willing of any kind \n for curing the mind of its fickleness deliberately reflect that the one brahman is the sky of the spirit the impartite self of the cosmos\n as an immense rock covered with main lines and sub lines learn to regard the one brahman with the three worlds superposed on it\n now it has been known that this problem world is not produced as there is no second entity to serve as a cause\n this alluring world may be looked upon as a marvel\n long agitated as i have been now i am at rest there is nothing other than pure spirit\n laying aside all doubts discarding all sense of wonder behold repudiating all mental constructions the principle of mindlessness may be seen to be the highest status\n those sages whose intellects are great and tranquil and who have risen above the mind\n one who has reasoned out the nature of things according to the vedanta the modifications of whose mind objectively induced have ceased who has given up all reasoning vis avis objects who has dismissed the objective realm empty of values but has seized on what alone has eternal value has a mind that conforms to the eternal reality\n when the net of deep seated impressions of empirical life is split as a fowler s net by a rat when due to dispassion s power the knots of the heart are loosened one s nature as brahman becomes crystal clear owing to the experiential knowledge of brahman even as muddy water treated with the kataka powder\n now one experiences the eternal witness no longer one beholds the inert non seen \n while yet living one is awakened to the supreme truth that alone is to be realized\n one is totally oblivious of the ways of the world shrouded in the thick gloom of delusion and due to an eminent degree of mature dispassion one ceases to have any relish for even the so called delectables that are in fact dry and tasteless\n like a bird from its cage from delusions flies forth the mind devoid of attachments frailties dualities and props\n the mind filled with truth shines like the full moon vanquishing all meanness born of perplexities and dismissing all dilemmas due to idle curiosities\n neither i nor aught else exists here i am but brahman that is peace thus perceives he who beholds the link between the existent and the non existent\n as the mind indifferently contacts objects of the senses of sight etc\n when encountered by chance so does the man of steadfast intellect regard courses of action in his daily life \n experience lived through knowledgeably alone proves sait isfactory\n the thief recognised and befriended is no longer a thief but turns out to be a friend\n as an unplanned journey to a village when accomplished is treated wiyout elation by the travellers so is the splendour of enjoyment that may fall to their lot deemed by those who know\n even a little diversion of the well controlled mind is reckoned quite ample no elaboration of it is sought as such elaboration is a source of future afflictions\n a king liberated from detention is glad to eat but a morsel\n one unattacked and undetained hardly cares for his entire kingdom\n locking one arm in the other setting one row of teeth on the other and putting some limbs against others conquer the mind\n from this sea of empirical life there is no way out except victory over the mind\n in this vast empire of hell hard to subdue are one s and adversaries the sense organs who ride on the unruly elephants the sins and are armed with the long arrows of cravings\n in the case of one whose egoistic vigour has been attenuated and who has vanquished his foes the sense organs latent impressions intent on enjoyments wear off as lotuses do in winter\n like no eternal spirits latent impressions cut capers only as long as the mind remains unvanquished for lack of intense cultivation of the non dual truth\n of the men of discrimination the mind i deem is a servant as it accomplishes what is sought a minister as it proves the cause of all gains and a loyal chieftain as it regulates the assailing sense organs\n the mind of the wise i deem is a loving spouse as it pleases a protective parent as it guards and a friend as it marshals the best arguments the paternal mind well studied with the eye of the shastras and realized in the light of one s own reason abolishes itself in yielding supreme perfection\n extremely perverse and inveterate in itself once well awakened and controlled and purged the delightful mind gem shines in one s heart powered by its own virtues\n o brahmin to win perfection be luminous after washing clean in the waters of discrimination the mind gem steeped in the mire of many flaws\n by wholly overcoming the inimical senses resorting to sovereign discrimination and beholding the truth with the intellect cross the sea of empirical existence\n the wise know that concern as such is the abode of endless pains they also know that unconcern is the home of joys both here and hereafter\n bound by the cords of latent impressions this world revolves constituting empirical life \n in manifestation they agonise when obliterated they make for well being\n though intellectual yough extremely and variously learned yough high born and eminent one is bound by cravings as a lion is with a chain\n resorting to supreme personal endeavour and perseverance and conforming to shastraic conduct unwaveringly who may not win perfection i am this entire cosmos i am the supreme self that lapses not\n nothing other than me is this vision is the supreme assertion of the self as i or the first level of self assertion \n i transcend all i am subtler than a hair s tip such o brahmin is the second and beneficent mode of self assertion\n this mode promotes liberation and not bondage\n witness the case of the liberated in life\n the conviction that i am no more than a bundle of parts like hands feet etc\n is the third mode of self assertion it is empirical and petty\n this root of the evil tree of empirical life is wicked and must be renounced\n smitten by this the worldly man rapidly falls ever lower\n discarding this wicked mode of self assertion from one s life in due course by virtue of the beneficent mode one achieves liberation in peace\n resorting to the first two non worldly modes of self assertion the third worldly mode that occasions pain must be renounced\n next discarding even the first two one becomes free from all modes of self assertion and thus ascends to the transcendent status of freedom \n bondage is nothing but craving for objective enjoyment its renunciation is said to be liberation\n mind s affirmation is perilous its negation is great good fortune\n the mind of the knower tends to negation the mind of the ignorant is the chain of bondage \n the timeless mind of the knower is either blissful nor blissless neither fickle nor stirless\n it neither is nor is not\n nor does it occupy a mind position among all these so maintain the wise\n just as due to subtlety ether illumined by the spirit is not objectively perceived so the impartite spirit yough all perceiving is not observed\n the imperishable spirit free from all imaginings and beyond nomenclature has been assigned designations like one s self etc\n transparent like a hundredth part of ether partless as manifested in those who know ever aware of the sole self of all that is pure in empirical life this spirit neither sets nor rises neither rises up nor lies low neither goes nor returns it is neither present nor absent here\n this spirit has a flawless mode of its own indubitable and propless\n at the very outset purify the disciple through excellence such as mind s tranquillity restraint of sense organs etc\n next impart to him the teaching that all this world is brahman viz\n one who teaches an ignoramus or half awakened disciple that all this is brahman will in effect plunge him in an endless series of hells\n but a disciple whose intellect has been well awakened whose craving for objective enjoyments has been extinguished and who is free from all expectations is rid of all impurities born of nescience the wise teacher may instruct him\n like its effulgence where there is light like the day where there is the sun like the fragrance where there is a flower so is there a world where there is the spirit\n when the view point of knowledge is purged when the dawn of awakening spreads vastly this very world will cease to appear as real\n established in yourself you will realize aright the strength and weakness of the flood of my words of instruction you will realize it by the highest mode of nescience that spurs the effort to wipe out the sphere of the petty self\n by it the highest mode of nescience is won the knowledge that consumes all errors o brahmin one missile puts another out of action one flaw destroys its opposite\n one poison may be neutralised by another an enemy may destroy another\n such is the wonderful riddle of elements that pleases through self destruction the real nature of this riddle is not perceived\n as it is observed it perishes observed with the flaming imagination whose content is in truth it exists not at all \n he who cherishes with the creative and liberating imagination the yought that all this is spirit that the perception of difference is nescience should renounce this nescience in all possible ways\n sage that ultimate status which is said to be imperishable is in truth not won\n twice born sage speculate not as to whence this nescience has arisen\n speculate rather on how shall i destroy it once it is dissipated and dispelled you will renunciation cognise that status\n that integral status includes the knowledge whence this maya has come and how it has perished\n therefore try to treat with remedies this abode of diseases i\n so that she may not subject you again to the sufferings of birth etc\n the sea of the spirit shines forth in one s self with its splendid inner vibrations\n with certitude meditate inwardly that is homogeneous and infinite\n the power of the spirit in the sea of the spirit is a slightly agitated state of the latter\n like a wave in the sea that pure power shines forth there just as the wind automatically blows in the sky\n in the same way the self in itself by its own power becomes mobile\n that omnipotent deity flashes forth for a moment\n whose potencies of space time and action are not enhanced by any means who is preeminently established in her infinitude being fully conscious of her own essential nature\n un comprehended she brings into being a finite form\n when that supremely enchanting deity brings forth that finite form\n other ideas views names number etc\n the individual self knower of the field is the designation of this form of the spirit o brahmin it is the basis of space time and activity and its forms are rooted in manifold mental constructions\n he the knower of the field generating latent impressions again assumes the form of egoism\n the tainted egoism as determiner is called intellect which imagining forms becomes the base for cogitation or mind \n with its profuse imaginings the mind slowly is transmuted into sense organs\n the wise deem the body with its hands and feet nothing but the senses\n thus indeed in stages descends the jiva bound by the cords of imaginings and impressions and encompassed by a multitude of sufferings\n the potent spirit thus degenerating into dense egoism passes voluntarily into bondage as a silk worm in its cocoon\n and like a lion in chains becomes totally dependent finding itself within a net of its own imaginings and nothing more\n sometimes it operates as mind sometimes as intellect sometimes as cognition sometimes as pure action\n sometimes it is egoism and sometimes it is held to be what is yought\n sometimes it is called prakriti and sometimes it is held to be maya\n sometimes it is designated a flaw and sometimes referred to as action \n sometimes it is proclaimed as bondage and sometimes accounted the eight fold case \n sometimes it is said to be avidya and sometimes it is identified with desire \n bearing within itself as its seeds the fig tree this entire empirical sphere that fashions the cords of cravings the jiva is verily a tree sans fruits\n o brahmin like an elephant stuck in the morass is the mind consumed in the flames of worries crushed by the python of rage attached to the waves of the sea of lust and oblivious of its own grand progenitor the spirit rescue it\n thus are the jivas living beings phases of the spirit and established through bringing the empirical sphere into being\n their forms in lakhs and crores have been assigned by brahma\n numberless jivas were born in the past and even now are being brought forth on all sides\n others also will be born like multitudes of water drops from a water fall\n some of them are in their first birth others have already had more than a hundred births\n yet others have already had countless births\n some will have two or more births besides\n some are born as sub human and super human beings gifted with music and knowledge some as mighty reptiles\n some of these living beings are to be identified with the sun the moon and the lord of waters others with shiva vishnu and brahma\n some divided themselves as brahmins kshatriyas vaishyas sudras\n others with grass herbs trees with their fruits roots and winged insects\n jivas are also to be identified with trees like the kadamba the jambira the sama tala and tamala\n and with mounts like mahendra malaya sahya mandara and meru and with the seas of salt water milk ghee and sugarcane juice\n and with the vast quarters and fast running rivers some of these sport high above the earth some descend and again fly upwards\n hit ceaselessly by death as yough they are balls hit by the hands these jivas are ceaselessly struck down by death as balls are by the hand\n having undergone yousands of births again some unwise ones despite a degree of discrimination fall into the turmoils of worldly life\n the principle of the self undetermined by space time etc\n by virtue of its power just sportively assumes a body spatial and temporal\n possessed of innate tendencies to manifest various orders of living beings itself is the supreme lord and creator that becomes the mind that is unstable and inclined to construction and dissolution\n in the beginning in a moment the constructive power of the mind fashions the transparent image of space inclined to own as its essence the seed of sound\n then becoming dense by the process of gross vibrations that mind brings forth the vibrations of air inclined to own the seed of touch\n of these two space and air the bases of sound and touch by intense repetitive frictions is generated the fire\n then the mind enriched by these three including rudimentary form proceeds to the notion of pure liquidity and instantaneously becomes aware of the coolness of water followed by the perception of water\n the mind thus enriched by such attributes meditates all at once on rudimentary smell thence arises the perception of the earth element\n next this body encompassed by the rudimentary elements discards its subtleness beholding in the sky a flash like a spark of fire\n conjoined to the element of egoism and the seed of the intellect this bee in the lotus of the elemental heart is now styled the puryashtaka\n due to intensity of yearning in it by meditating on a resplendent embodiment the mind grows grosser as a bilva fruit does through the process of ripening\n that effulgence in the sky shining like liquid gold in a crucible assumes a form with definite contours by virtue of its inherent nature\n upwards is the round head downwards the feet\n of the two sides are the hands and in the middle what functions as the belly\n in course of time the body indwelt by the mind gets fully developed and becomes flawless\n that same divine brahma the grandfather of the entire world gets established in intelligence purity strength energy forms of knowledge and lordship\n beholding his own attractive and pre eminent body the blessed lord the range of whose perception embraces all the three divisions of time wondered what first would make its appearance in this supreme space whose essence is pure spirit and whose limits are nowhere\n thus wondered brahma whose vision was as flawless as that of shiva\n in large groups he behold bygone orders of cosmic manifestation\n next he recollected them all in the due order of all their attributes\n then sportively he fashioned by sheer imagination variegated living beings with their unique patterns of behaviour the whole constituting as it were a city in the sky\n for securing their happy state as well as liberation for attaining righteousness love and wealth he set up shastras endless and varied\n as the existence of the world has been set up by mind in the form of brahma it lasts only as long as brahma with his destruction the world too perishes\n o best of brahmins in reality nothing anywhere at any time is born or is destroyed\n all that is seen is unreal neither is nor is not \n give up the idle show of empirical life a very pit of the serpents of cravings\n knowing this to be unreal reduce them all to the status of their ground\n vis a vis the city in the sky whether adorned or not or the parts of its constitutive case the nescience progeny etc\n what rationale is there for pleasures and pains sorrow and not a sense of gratification is in order as regards wealth and spouse in their nourishing state\n who can have a sense of reassurance here as the nescience of delusion gets more and more entrenched those very empirical experiences which in their abundance cause a fool to get attached to this world are the source in the case of a wise man of his dispassion\n therefore nidagha with your awareness of truth cultivate indifference to whatever has perished among the activities of empirical life and accept whatever offers itself\n the marks of a man of discrimination are spontaneous indifference to experiences that do not come of their own accord and hearty acceptance of those that do\n knowing and resorting to the untarnished middle status between the real and the unreal neither cling to nor fly from the objective realm external or internal\n the intelligence of a wise and active man free from attachment and aversion remains untarnished like a lotus leaf unmoistened by water\n o twice born sage if the glamour of objects charms not your heart then having grasped what ought to be known achieved true wisdom you have crossed the sea of empirical life\n in order to win the pre eminent status separate by means of supreme wisdom the functioning mind from all latent impressions as one does a strong scent from the flower\n the superior men of discrimination who board the ship of wisdom cross this sea of empirical life full of the waters of latent impressions\n those men who know this world as well as what is beyond conform to all things\n they neither shun nor seek the ways of the world\n the sprouting of mental construction consists in spirits proneness to objects knowables the spirit that is infinite that is the truth of the self and that is universal being\n that very sprouting having lightly come into being gradually fills out developing into the mind then it promotes inertness like a cloud\n imagining objects as other than the self as it were the spirit is transformed into a constructive process as it were just as a seed is into a sprout\n mental construction is indeed the process of putting together of constituents it comes automatically into being and waxes fast unto pain never unto delight\n indulge not in mental construction in a state of stability dwell not on positive existence\n persevere in stopping mental construction\n thus one never again pursues the trail of construction\n by the mere absence of imagination the process of mental construction dwindles automatically\n one act of construction leads to another\n mind battens on itself o sage getting off construction abide in the self\n once this is done what can prove difficult just as this sky is empty so is the entire cosmos\n wise brahmin just as a paddy husk or the black coating on copper through effort is destroyed so also may the mental impurities of man\n as a grain of paddy the innate impurity of a jiva too can be destroyed in ample measure\n there is no doubt in that\n giving up the deeply felt and seductive glamour consisting in imagination of empirical life you remain what you really are o sinless one sportively roam the world\n by means of the trenchant and creative yought i am a non agent in all contexts there remains but the perception of sameness called supreme immortality \n in regard to all elaborations of pain due solely to one s sense of agency finally there remains but sameness when one s mental constructions dwindle away\n this sameness amidst all emotional moods is the status grounded in truth\n anchored in it the mind is no more reborn\n o sage renouncing all forms of agency and non agency and abolishing the mind you remain what you really are be steadfast\n stead fast in the final stability give up the very tendency to renunciation\n giving up everything together with its cause the dichotomy between spirit and mind light and darkness etc\n the latent impressions and what generates them as well as the vibrations of vital breath be you skylike with a stilled intellect\n having totally wiped out from the heart the massed rows of latent impression one who remains free from all anxiety is the liberated is the supreme deity\n i have seen all that is worth seeing through delusion have i wandered in all the ten directions of space\n for the ignorant who roams through reasoning the regions of empirical existence the latter shrinks into the dimensions of a cow s hoof\n in the body with its ins and outs up and down in the regions between here and there there is the self there is no world that is not the self through and through\n there is nothing in which i am not there is nothing which is not that through and through\n what more do i want all things are essentially being and spirit pervaded by that\n all this is indeed brahman all this extended reality is the self\n i am one and this is another give up this delusion o sinless one the superimposed objects cannot possibly be in the eternal extended and undivided brahman\n there is neither sorrow delusion old age nor birth\n what in reality is here only that exists\n always be calm experiencing things as they occur and entertaining no desire whatsoever\n neither shunning nor grasping be always calm\n magnanimous one flawless cognitions swiftly fly to him who finds himself in his last birth just as pure pearls lodge themselves in the best bamboo\n this example has been offered to suit best those who develop dispassion\n the certitude of the joy of cognition results from intimate contact of the perceiver and the object\n we duly meditate on that stable self manifest in the truth of one s self the source of the joy of cognition \n giving up the seer s perception and the object together with latent impressions we duly meditate on the self that manifests itself first as perception\n we duly meditate on the eternal self the illumination of all lights that occupies the middle ground between the is and the is not \n discarding the lord who reigns in the heart those who run after some other god are in fact seeking a gem after casting away the kaustubha already in their possession\n as indra smites mountain peaks with his thunder bolt so should one strike with the rod of discrimination these adversaries in the form of sense organs both active and passive\n in the evil dream seen in the night of empirical life in this empty illusion of the body everything experienced as the extended delusion of empirical life is impure\n in childhood one is stupefied by ignorance in youth one in vanquished by woman\n in the period that remains one is worried by one s wife\n what can one the meanest of men accomplish but wail as follows unreality rides on the top of existence ugliness on the top of things lovely pains ride on the top of pleasures\n what single entity may i resort to even those men pass away on the closing and opening of whose eyes depends world s disaster or prosperity\n of what account are folk like my humble self empirical life is said to be the very limit of sufferings\n when one s body has slipped into its depths how can pleasure be won i am awake i am awake here is the wicked thief who has been pestering me viz\n i shall destroy him i have long been under his assault\n don t be depressed\n seek not to seize what is fit only to be eschewed\n giving up ideas of both rejection and seizure remain rooted in what is neither to be rejected nor seized be wholly firm\n the knower rid of things to be rejected or seized has wiyout latent impressions qualities such as freedom from desire and fear conation and action eternity equality wisdom gentleness certitude steadfastness amiability contentment charity and soft spokenness\n with the sharp needle of penetrating intelligence tear up the nest cast by the fisherwoman of craving in the waters of transmigratory life a net made of the cords of variegated youghts even as a strong wind scatters the vast net of clouds\n then abide in the vast status as immutable brahman \n cleaving the mind with the mind itself as one does a tree with an axe and attaining the holy status at once be steadfast\n standing or moving sleeping or walking dwelling in a place flying aloft or falling down inwardly sure that all this is but unreal eschew all clinging\n if you depend on this objective world you have a mind and are in bondage\n if you reject the objective world you have no mind you are liberated\n neither am i nor is this real so thinking remain absolutely immovable in the intervals of subjective and objective awareness\n rid of what enjoys and what is enjoyed set in the middle ground between the object and its enjoyer be ever given to the contemplation of your self as pure awareness\n dwelling on the taste be filled with the supreme self resorting to the propless steady yourself off and on\n those who are bound by ropes are released but none in the grip of craving may be released by anyone\n therefore nidagha shed craving by renouncing all mental constructions\n cutting through this innate and sinful craving whose essence is egoism with the needle of selfabnegation be stationed in the border land of the future and the present entirely quelling all fear whatsoever\n rejecting the inveterate idea\n i am the very life of these objects and these objects are my very life wiyout these i am nothing and they are nothing wiyout me and reflecting i do not belong to any object and no object belongs to me the intellect becomes tranquillised and the actions are performed in a sporting spirit\n latent impression of such an agent stand renounced\n this renunciation o brahmin is extolled as woryour of profound meditation due to the equilibrium of the intellect total obliteration of latent impressions is acquired\n that indeed should be deemed the obliteration of latent impressions having won which one gives up even the body as one is free from all sense of possessions\n he is called the jivanmukta liberated in life who lives after giving up all conceivable objects for he has recreatively given up all latent egoistic impressions\n having given up all baseless mental constructions and the latent impressions he who has won tranquillity is the best among the knowers of brahman he is the liberated\n his renunciation may only be deduced\n these two fearless ones unconcerned about pleasures and pains that occur in the due course of time have achieved the status as brahman the passive renouncer and the active yogin both of whom are self disciplined and tranquillised\n o lord of sages for they neither strive for nor reject anything amidst the inner mental modifications\n he is called the jivanmukta who lives as one in dreamless sleep who is neither lifted up nor depressed by the emotions of joy intolerance fear anger lust and helplessness and who is free from all objective pre occupations\n the craving born of latent impressions oriented towards external objects is said to be bound\n the same freed from latent impressions bound up with objects as such is said to be liberated\n know that the desire culminating in the prayerful yought let this be mind to be a strong chain that spawns suffering birth and fear\n the magnanimous man renounces this enchaining desire vis a vis objects both real and unreal and wins the status that is sublime\n then outgrowing the attachment both to bondage and liberation and the states of pain and pleasure attachment both to the real and unreal remains unshaken like the unagitated ocean\n good sir man may have a four fold certitude\n engendered by my mother and father i am the body from the foot to the head\n this particular certitude o brahmin results from the observation of the worries of bondage good men have second kind of certitude that promotes liberation viz\n i am beyond all objects and beings i am subtler than the tip of a hair \n best of brahmins a third kind of certitude has been affirmed promotive of liberation alone consisting in the yought all this objective world the entire indestructible universe is but myself \n also there is a fourth certitude yielding liberation that consists of the assertion i and the entire world are empty and sky like at all times \n of these the first is said to result from the craving that earns bondage\n those having the last three are sportive extremely pure and are liberated in this very life\n their cravings have been wholly purified\n great souled sage the mind seized with the certitude i am everything is never born again to taste of sorrow that brahman has been identified with emptiness prakriti maya and also consciousness\n it has also been said to be shiva pure spirit the lord the eternal and the self \n there flourishes but the non dual power that is the supreme self through and through it sportively builds up the universe with factors born of both duality and non duality\n he who resorts to the status beyond all objects who is through and through the spirit that is perfect who is neither agitated nor complacent never suffers in this empirical life\n who performs the actions that fall to his lot ever viewing foe and friend alike who is liberated from both likes and dislikes is neither sad nor hopeful\n who utters what pleases all speaks pleasantly when asked and who is conversant with the youghts of all beings never suffers in this empirical life\n resorting to the primeval vision of reality marked by the renunciation of all objects and selfestablished fearlessly roam the world as a veritable jivanmukta\n inwardly shedding all cravings free from attachment rid of a all latent impressions but externally conforming to established patterns of conduct fearlessly roam the world\n externally simulating enthusiastic activity but at heart free from it all apparently an agent but really a non agent roam the world with a purified understanding\n renouncing egoism with an apparent reason shining like the sky untarnished roam the world with a purified understanding\n elevated clean of conduct conforming to established norms of conduct free from all inner clinging leading as it were an empirical life\n resorting to the inner spirit of renunciation apparently he acts to achieve some aim or other \n only small men discriminate saying one is a relative the other is a stranger\n for those who live magnanimously the entire world constitutes but a family\n resort to the status free from all considerations of empirical life beyond old age and death who are all mental constructions are extinguished and where no attachments finds lodgement\n this is the status of brahman absolutely pure beyond all cravings and sufferings\n equipped thus and roaming the earth one is not vanquished by crisis\n by the prop of detachment and excellences like magnanimity lift up your mind yourself perseveringly in order to enjoy the fruit of brahmic freedom\n through detachment it achieves perfection along the path of negation of the object \n the mind then is emptied of all cravings as the pure lake is of water in the season of autumn\n why is not an intelligent man ashamed of clinging to the same dry routine of insipid actions day after day bondage is fashioned by consciousness as subject and its objects once free from these liberation follows\n consciousness spirit is never an object all is self this is the essence of all vedantic doctrines\n resorting to this sure doctrine behold the world intellectually and freely\n you will independently achieve the self the status of bliss holding i am spirit these worlds are spirit the directions in space are spirit these manifested beings are spirit\n i am the glory mahas devoid of objects and perceptions wholly pure of form eternally manifest rid of all appearances seer witness spirit free from all objects the full orbed light in essence for which no knowables exist knowledge pure and simple \n king of sages with all mental constructions wiped out all yearnings abolished resort to the status of certitude and be self established in the self\n the brahmin seeker after truth who dwells upon the mahopanishad becomes a well versed vedic scholar\n if uninitiated he becomes initiated he becomes purified by fire by air by the sun by the moon by truth by all agents of purification\n he becomes known to all gods is cleaned as if he has dipped in all sacred waters\n he dwells in the youghts of all gods\n he has as it were performed all sacrifices\n to him accrue the fruits of having repeated the gayatri sixty yousand times of having repeated itihasa and puranas and srirudra a lac of times of having repeated omkara ten yousand times\n he hollows the rows of living beings as far as the eye reaches and seven generations both in the past and in the future\n through repetition of sacred utterances one wins immortality this is the mahopanishad\n om let my limbs and speech prana eyes ears vitality and all the senses grow in strength\n all existence is the brahman of the upanishads\n may i never deny brahman nor brahman deny me\n let there be no denial at all let there be no denial at least from me\n may the virtues that are proclaimed in the upanishads be in

illusion oh god parameshwara oh god of gods how will they attain salvation be kind enough to tell\n asked lord brahma to lord parameshwara and he replied as follows \n some people say that the only way out is jnana knowledge \n to attain occult powers that alone will not suffice\n how can jnana wiyout yoga lead to salvation it is also true that yoga alone wiyout jnana will not lead to salvation\n so the one who aims at salvation should learn jnana and yoga together\n like a rope ties a bird the minds of all living beings are tied\n enquiries and researches do not affect the tie of this mind\n so the only way to win over this mind is through victory over prana\n there is no other option to get victory over prana except yoga and there are no methods except those shown by siddhas\n so i am teaching you this yoga shika head of all yogas \n it is greater than all jnanas\n after sitting in either padmasana lotus position or any other asana and after concentrating the sight to the tip of the nose and after controlling both the hands and legs meditate on the letter om with a concentrated mind\n if one continuously meditates on parameshwara he would become an expert in yoga and the parameshwara would appear before him\n if we sit in an asana and continuously practice the bindu will cease from going down\n wiyout pooraka and rechaka the prana would stand in kumbhaka for a very long time\n you would hear different types of sound\n the nectar will start flowing from the place of the moon\n hunger and thirst will cease\n mind would get concentrated on the ever flowing bliss\n the four steps for this are mantra yoga laya yoga hatha yoga and raja yoga\n the great maha yoga which is one has been divided in to four and named as above\n the prana goes out with sound ham and goes in with the word sa and all beings naturally chant the mantra hamsa hamsa while exhaling and inhaling \n this is chanted in the sushumna after being taught by the guru in an inverted manner hamsa inverted is soham \n this chanting of the mantra soham soham i am it is called mantra yoga\n sun is the letter ha and moon is the letter tha \n the joining of sun and the moon is the hatha yoga\n due to hatha yoga the idiocy which is the cause of all doshas draw backs is swallowed\n when the merging of jeevatma and paramatma takes place mind melts and vanishes\n and only air of prana remains\n this is called laya yoga\n because of laya yoga that heavenly swathmananda sowkhya the well being of the joy of ones own soul is attained\n in the great temple of the middle of yoni the female organ the principle of the devi which is red like hibiscus flower lives as rajas in all beings\n the merger of this rajas with the male principle is called raja yoga\n as a result of raja yoga the yogi gets all the occult powers like anima\n you have to understand that all these four types of yogas are nothing but the merger of prana apana and samana\n for all those who have a body their body is the temple of shiva\n it can give them occult powers\n the triangular part in between the anus and penis is called the mooladhara\n this is the place where shiva lives as a life giving force\n there the parashakthi called kundalani lives\n from there wind is produced\n the fire is also produced from there\n from there only the sound hamsa and the mind are also produced\n this place which would give whatever is asked for is called kamakhya peetam the seat of passion \n in the edge of the anus is the swadishtana chakra with six petals\n near the belly is the mani poora chakra with its ten petals\n in the place near the heart the anahatha chakra with its petals exists\n and hey lord brahma this is called the poorna giri peeta\n in the depression in the throat vishudhi chakra with its petals exists\n hey lord of lords that is the jalandara chakra\n in between the eyelids is the agna chakra with its two petals\n over that is the maha peeta called udayana\n second chapter this world functions because of the unclear foundation power which is described as maha maya maha lakshmi maha devi and maha saraswathi\n that power shines in a micro form as a bindu dot on the peeta seat \n that bindu breaks the peeta and emerges from there in the form of nadha sound \n that nadha brahma assumes three shapes viz\n macro micro and external\n the macro form is the big shape which is pervaded by the five brahmans\n the micro form which arises from the nadha with its three bheejas roots is the form of hiranya garbha\n para is the ever true property of satchitananda\n by continuously chanting the atma mantra the glitter will occur in para thathwa the philosophy of the external \n for the yogi who has stopped his mind this appears in the micro form similar to the flame of the lamp moon s crescent like a fire fly like a streak of lightning and like the glitter of stars\n there are no greater mantras than nadha sound no gods greater than atma no greater worship than the meditation and no pleasure greater than sait isfaction\n my devotee who understands this would remain stable in his happiness\n to that great man who has great devotion to god as well as similar great devotion to his teacher all this would be understood automatically\n third chapter that great ever living nadha sound is called sabhda brahman\n it is the strength residing in the mooladhara\n para is the foundation for its own self and is of the form of bindhu\n that nadha coming out of parashakthi similar to the germ coming out of the seed is called pasyanthi we see \n the yogis who are able to see using the pasyanthi shakthi understand that it is the whole world\n that power produces sound like a rain starting from the heart\n hey lord of lords there it is called madhyama\n it is called vaikari when it merges in the sound form with prana and exists in the throat and jaw\n it produces all the alphabets from aa to ksha\n from alphabet words arise and from words rise the sentences and from them all the vedas and mantras\n this goddess saraswathi lives in the cave of intelligence in all beings\n in meditation when will power melts you can reach this para thathwa\n fourth chapter because the divine power is single there are no differences there\n you have to understand that the yought process of living beings is like seeing a snake in a rope\n when you do not know it is a rope and then for a small time the rope appears as a snake\n the ordinary intelligence is similar to this\n we see everything as the world that we see\n there is no reason or basis for this world to be different from this brahman\n so the world is only brahman and not anything different\n if you understand the para thathwa like this where is the cause for differentiation\n in taittiriya upanishad fear has been told as belonging to that foolish person who finds difference between jeevatma soul and paramatma god \n though this world has been told as some thing to be experienced in the next moment it vanishes like a dream\n there is no state of waking up in a dream\n there is no dream in the state of waking up\n both of them are not there in laya\n laya is not in both of them\n all these three are illusions created by the three characters\n the one who sees this would be above characteristics and would be forever\n the chaithanya activity starts in the form of the world\n all these are brahman\n it is useless to differentiate it as atma and anatma when dealing with wise people\n the foolish man thinks that body is attached to the soul\n the belief that pot is mixed with the mud and the water is mixed with mirage and similarly the belief that body is mixed up with the soul is because of taking recourse to ignorance\n fifth chapter that yogi who has mastered yoga and who has complete control over his senses would attain whatever he imagines\n the teacher guru is the brahma he is vishnu and he is the lord of lords sadashiva and there is nobody greater than the teacher in all the three worlds\n we should worship with devotion that parameshwara who is the great soul who has taught us the divine knowledge\n the one who worships like that would get the result of jnana fully\n do not keep your aim because of the wavering mind on occult powers\n the one who knows this principle well is the one who has attained salvation\n there is no doubt about it\n sixth chapter that great light in which the bhoo loka bhuvar loka and suvar loka worlds and the sun moon and fire gods are but a small part in the letter om \n when mind wavers the worldly life and when it is firm the salvation will result\n so lord brahma using great intelligence we have to keep the mind not to waver\n for desire to posses wealth the mind is the reason\n when that is destroyed the world would be destroyed\n one should with lot of effort start the treatment for that\n when a man looks after his mind using his mind and realizes that it has stopped running he would see the parabrahmaan which is very difficult to see\n the yogi is able to get salvation by seeing his mind with his mind\n we have to see the mind with the mind and hanker for that mad state\n we have to see the mind with the mind and be stable in yoga\n in any place where the wind moves the mind also wavers\n mind is called moon sun wind sight and fire\n the bindu dot nadha sound and the kala crescent are the gods vishnu brahma and ishwara\n by constant practice of nadha the bad influences will vanish\n that which is nadha becomes the bindu and then becomes the mind\n one has to clearly aim at the unification of nadha bindu and chintha\n mind itself is the bindu and that is the reason for the state of creation of the world\n similar to milk being produced by the cow bindu is produced by the mind\n the one who realizes well the six wheels agna chakras enters the world of pleasure\n one has to enter it by controlling the airs in the body\n one has to send the air vayu upwards\n one has to practice vayu bindu chakra and chintha\n once the yogi realizes samadhi by one of them he feels that everything is nectar like\n similar to the fact that the fire inside the wood cannot be brought out wiyout churning it by another wood wiyout practice the lamp of wisdom can not be lit\n adopting his teacher as the one who pilots the ship and by adopting his teachings as the stable ship with the power of constant practice one crosses the sea of this birth\n thus tells this upanishad\n om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces

    "Turiyatita": "om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me \n now the grandfather of all people the god brahma respectfully approaching his father adinarayana lord vishnu said what is the path of the avadhutas after the turiyatita stage and what is their standing to him replied the lord narayana wise sages consider that one who remains in the path of the avadhuta is very rare in the world and such sages are not many if one becomes an avadhuta he is ever pure he is indeed the embodiment of dispassion he is indeed the visible form of wisdom and he is indeed the personification of the veda vedapurusha \n he is a truly great man as his mind abides in me alone\n indeed i too abide in him\n in due order having been first a hut dwelling ascetic kutichaka he reaches the stage of a mendicant monk bahudaka the mendicant monk attains to the stage of a hamsa ascetic the hamsa ascetic then becomes the highest kind of ascetic paramahamsa \n in this stage by introspection he realizes the entire world as non different from his self renouncing all personal possessions in a reservoir of waters such things as his emblematic staff water pot waist band loincloth that covers his privities and all ritualistic duties enjoined on him in a previous stage becoming unclad lit\n clothed by the points of the compass abandoning even the acceptance of a discoloured worn out bark garment or deer skin behaving thereafter after the stage of the paramahamsa as one subject to no mantras i\n performing no rituals and gives up shaving oil bath the perpendicular mark of sandal paste on the forehead etc\n he is one terminating all religious and secular duties free of religious merit or otherwise in all situations giving up both knowledge and ignorance conquering the influence of cold and heat happiness and misery honour and dishonour having burnt up in advance with the latent influence vasana of the body etc\n censure praise pride rivalry ostentation haughtiness desire hatred love anger covetousness delusion gloating joy intolerance envy clinging to life etc\n viewing his body as a corpse as it were becoming equanimous effortlessly and unrestrainedly in gain or loss sustaining his life with food placed in the mouth like a cow sait isfied with food as it comes wiyout ardently longing for it reducing to ashes the host of learning and scholarship guarding his conduct wiyout vaunting his noble way of life disowning the superiority or inferiority of any one firmly established in non duality of the self which is the highest principle of all and which comprises all within itself cherishing the conviction there is nought else distinct from me absorbing in the self the fuel of concept other than the secret known only by the gods untouched by sorrow unresponsive to worldly happiness free of desire for affection unattached everywhere to the auspicious or the inauspicious with the functioning of all senses at standstill unmindful of the superiority of his conduct learning and moral merit dharma acquired in the previous stages of his life giving up the conduct befitting caste and stage of life vanaprastha dreamless as night and day are the same to him ever on the move everywhere remaining with the body alone left to him his water pot being the watering place only ever sensible but wandering alone as yough he were a child madman or ghost always observing silence and deeply meditating on his self he has for his support the propless brahman forgetting everything else in consonance with the absorption in his self this turiyatita sage reaching the state of the avadhuta ascetic and completely absorbed in non duality of the atman finally gives up his body as he has become one with om the pranava such an ascetic is an avadhuta he has accomplished his life s purpose\n thus ends the upanishad\n om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the turiyatitavadhutopanishad belonging to the sukla yajur veda",

there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me first adhyaya \n now we shall expound the upanishad on renunciation\n he who in due order of the stages of life gives up the primary inclinations such as the desire for wealth etc\n becomes one who has renounced worldly life \n what is this called renunciation how does one renounce one who guards himself by the following activities who has for his renunciation the approval of mother father wife sons and kinsmen should assemble all the officiating priests known to him and as before with their approval perform the vaishvanara sacrifice for the welfare of all people \n he shall after partition give away all his wealth to the officiating priests\n for the priests are the singers of the vedic hymns deserving the gift \n the five vital airs prana apana vyana udana and samana shall be symbolically placed in all the sacrificial vessels over the five sacred fires the ahavaniya garhapatya anvaharyapachana sabhya and avasayoura\n shaving off his hair along with the tuft snapping the sacred thread and seeing his son he shall consecrate himself with the mantras you are the god brahma you are the sacrifice you are everything \n if he has no son he should consecrate himself thus and not minding anything proceed as a mendicant monk eastward or northward\n he may receive alms from people of the four castes\n he should eat from the vessel of his hands\n he shall consider food as medicine\n he should take food as medicine i\n he should eat as and when he gets food wiyout discontent and not asking for more like oliver twist for bare sustenance and in such a way that there is no increase of fat\n having grown lean he may shelter one night in a village five nights in a town he may reside during the four rainy months in a village or town\n interpreting fortnights as months he may reside in a fixed abode for two months\n if he is unable to endure heat or cold he may accept as gift a tattered garment or bark dress\n he shall not accept any other\n for penance is to suffer pain with equanimity \n what then is the sacred thread the tuft and the ceremonial sipping of water to one who thus renounces in the prescribed manner and who thus views it in the correct perspective to him the questioner is this reply\n this is his sacred thread namely that he meditates on the atman the practice of brahma vidya is the tuft that he quenches his thirst with the vessel of his belly accomplishes the ceremonial duty with water that is present everywhere\n his residence is at the bank of a reservoir of water\n when the sun has set how can he ceremoniously sip water as he touches water during day so at night for he has neither night nor day\n the enlightened ascetic is above the restrictions of time \n this has been said by the vedic sage in a mantra to him there is only one time the day\n he who knows thus realizes the atman through this renunciation \n that person alone is entitled to renunciation who has undergone the forty purificatory rites samskaras has detachment from all worldly things has acquired purity of mind has burnt out desires envy intolerance and egoit ism and is equipped with the four disciplines of spiritual life sadhanas \n having resolved on renunciation he who does not embrace it shall perform the penance prajapatya alone as an atonement thereafter he is entitled to renounce the world \n one who having resolved on renunciation later denounces it one who supports a fallen ascetic as if he were genuine and one who throws obstacles in the path of those desiring renunciation these three classes of people are to be known as fallen\n now these persons yough possessing dispassion are not entitled to renunciation a eunuch a fallen man a maimed person women a deaf person a child a dumb person a heretic an informer a student who has not completed his study a vaikhanasa anchorite belonging to a vaishnava sect an ardent saivite haradvija a salaried teacher a man wiyout prepuce and one wiyout ritual fire\n even if they renounce the world they are not entitled to instruction in the great scriptural texts such as that thou art \n the son of one who has fallen from ascetic grace one having disease of the nails one who is brown toothed a consumptive as well as a deformed person these are never entitled to renounce\n one should never allow renunciation to those who have just settled as house holders those who have committed great sins those who have lost caste due to non performance of the principal purificatory rites vratyas and the accursed\n again one should never allow renunciation to one who is devoid of religious observances religious acts yajnas penance charity offering oblations in ritual fire and study of scripture and those fallen from truth and purity\n these do not deserve to renounce and no one can dispense with the due order except one sorely afflicted\n the person entitled to renounce should discard his tuft reciting om bhuh svaha \n saying the mantra the sacred thread shall not remain externally\n grant me fame strength spiritual wisdom dispassion and intelligence he shall snap the sacred thread and leave it in the waters along with his garment and waist band muttering om svaha then he should repeat thrice i have renounced \n seeing a brahmana who has renounced the world the sun moves from his place thinking this person will reach brahman breaking through my disc \n that wise man who says i have renounced raises to glory sixty generations of his family before him and sixty generations after him\n all the defects born of bad sons and all defects born of bodily weakness the praisa fire at the time of renouncing shall burn out just as the fire of chaff does to gold\n reciting the mantra friend guard me he the renouncer shall accept the emblematic staff\n the ascetic should bear a staff which shall be of bamboo smooth whole with the bark of even joints grown in holy ground and cleaned of all defects \n it shall be unscarred by forest fire uninjured by worms shining with its joints of length reaching upto the nose head or the eyebrows\n close association is always enjoined between the staff and the person a wise man shall not move wiyout the staff a distance three times that of an arrow throw\n reciting the mantra you are the receptacle of water which sustains the world never say nay to me you who are always agreeable to all he should receive the water vessel and invested with the yogic garment as aid to meditation he shall go about in an agreeable frame of mind\n give up concepts of righteousness and unrighteousness dharma and adharma give up both truth and untruth having given up both truth and untruth discard that by which you abandon all these i\n ascetic due to dispassion ascetic due to spiritual wisdom ascetic due to wisdom and dispassion and ascetic due to renunciation of action these are the four kinds of ascetics obtained\n this is how it is\n he is the ascetic due to dispassion who has become indifferent to sensory objects that are seen or heard of and who has renounced the world due to the influence of good actions done previously\n he alone is the ascetic due to jnana who being dead to worldly life due to the true knowledge of the scripture and listening to the experiences of the people in sin and goodness and who having discarded lingering attachment to the body scripture and the world and considering as worthless like vomit all worldly actions possesses the fourfold discipline in spiritual life and then renounces the world\n having studied in the prescribed manner all scripture and experienced all vicissitudes of life he is the ascetic due to jnana and dispassion who has his body alone left to him by meditation on the nature of the self due to jnana and dispassion and then renounces and becomes unclad as he was when born \n having completed the period of celibate studentship becoming a house holder and then embracing the stage of forest life vanaprastha he who renounces the world only in order to observe the order of the stages of life even yough wiyout dispassion is the ascetic who renounces action\n renunciation is of six kinds and the ascetics are called kutichaka bahudaka hamsa paramahamsa turiyatita and avadhuta\n the kutichaka ascetic has tuft and sacred thread bears a staff and water vessel wears a loin cloth and patched garment is devoted to the service of father mother and preceptor is equipped with a vessel spade sling etc\n alone is addicted to eating food in one place wears on the forehead a perpendicular mark of white sandal and holds a threefold emblematic staff\n the bahudaka ascetic wears tuft etc\n patched garment and three horizontal lines of holy ash on his forehead and is similar in all respects to the kutichaka ascetic except that he subsists on eight mouthfuls of food gathered as alms from eight houses as a bee does honey \n the hamsa ascetic wears matter hair puts on the forehead the mark of either the horizontal lines of holy ash or the perpendicular one of sandal subsists on food gathered as alms wiyout restriction and wears a piece of loin cloth\n the paramahamsa ascetic is devoid of tuft and sacred thread receives alms in the vessel of his hands wears a single loin cloth has a single patched garment one bamboo staff either wears a single garment or is smeared with holy ashes and has discarded all possessions and attachments \n the turiyatita ascetic subsists of fruits receiving them in his mouth like a cow if he eats cooked rice he receives them as alms from three houses\n he has his body alone left to him wiyout any possessions and attachment is unclad dressed by the points of the compass and treats his body as if it were a corpse\n the avadhuta ascetic has no fixed rules\n he eats food like a python as and when he gets it from persons of all castes except those who are fallen or accursed and is ever intent on meditation on the nature of the self\n i am not surely of this world consisting of trees grass and mountains\n how can i the supreme being be this external phenomenon which is intensely inert i am not the body which is non sentient and perishable in a short time\n i am not the sound which is non sentient coming from void and of the form of void and which remains for a short period grasped by the inert cavity of the ear\n i am not the touch which is non sentient but which has life granted to it by the favour of consciousness and which can be experienced by skin of momentary existence and in no other way\n i am not the taste which is non sentient dependent on matter and of short duration insignificant and brought into existence by the fickle tongue aided by the fickle mind\n i am not the form rupa which is non sentient non existent in the sole witness brahman perishable and which rests on sight and the object of sight which have but momentary existence\n i am not the smell which is non sentient subtle and of indefinable form and brought into existence by the perishable nose which is dead to smell\n i am pure consciousness alone which is devoid of parts mine ness and yought and which is quiescent and beyond the delusions of the five senses\n i am consciousness alone devoid of a place of worship and am illuminator omnipresent externally and internally devoid of parts and stain the light of distinctionless consciousness allpervading and one alone\n it is only by me the consciousness that all things such as pots and garments up to the sun are illumined by self effulgence as by a lamp\n it is only by me with my inwardly shining effulgence that the various senses are active just as the mass of sparks shine due to fire which is blazing within\n this pure eye of consciousness which enjoys endless bliss and which shines even when all others are extinct is victoriously present in all eyes\n salutation salutation to myself alone who am present in all other beings and consist of consciousness free from the restriction of an object to be known and am of the form of the individual self consciousness \n the various clearly seen powers such as those of earth etc\n are really rendered variegated by consciousness which is free of change one whole and free from the limitation of time and parts kala \n of consciousness which is beyond the three durations of past present and future is devoid of the restriction of perceivability of objects and which discards individuality of the soul there remains the oneness alone of the self and brahman \n indeed the same consciousness being beyond the reach of words seems to remain as having reached the state of the conclusion of selfishness i\n the state of non duality as if it were eternal non existence\n the same consciousness slightly encompassed by impurities of desires and non desires is unable to rise high like a female bird bound by a string\n people overcome by the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites which is born of desire and hatred become similar to worms which are sunk in the cavities of the earth\n salutation to the atman to you who are non different from consciousness\n i am now seized of the truth i am awakened i have risen above delusion \n i am lifted up from doubts i am what i am salutation to you to your and to me the eternal to you and to me consisting of consciousness\n salutation to you the supreme god and salutation to me the shiva\n though seated the atman is not seated yough going he does not go\n though quiescent he is engaged in activities yough performing action he is not tainted\n he is eminently accessible he is easily known like a close kinsman he is the bee in the interior of the lotus of the body of all\n i have no desire for the state of enjoyment nor for abandoning enjoyment\n let come what may let go what may\n when the mind is quelled in itself and has become free of egoit ism and when ideation is dissolved in itself i remain alone happy\n my enemy duality remains i\n is absorbed in the pure atman of vibration alone wiyout ideation egoit ism mind and desire\n breaking the bonds of intense desires from the cage of my body i know not where the female bird of non ego has flown up and gone\n he who has no egoit ism whose intellect is not tainted and who is equanimous to all beings his life shines bright\n he who looks at this phenomenal world like an impartial witness with his mind being cool within is freed of love and hatred has his life blessed\n he who understanding correctly abandons both the undesirables and the desirables and places his mind in its quiescence has his life blessed\n when the connecting link between the object and the person who grasps it has vanished peace comes well into being\n when peace has established itself it is called liberation\n like parched seeds there is no more sprouting of worldly birth the latent desires become pure in the heart of those who are liberated while living\n latent desire of a realized soul is purifying highly proper falls within the scope of pure nature consists of meditation on the atman and is eternal it remains as if in deep sleep\n understanding wiyout the mind is indeed said to be the individual consciousness\n as it is of the nature of the quiescent mind there is not the impurity of comprehension of distinctions \n where the mind is rendered quiescent there is truth and auspiciousness its is the true state it is omniscience and it is indeed complete sait isfaction\n when speaking giving taking opening and closing the eyes i am purely consciousness the bliss that comes of discarded thinking process\n having discarded the impurity of things to be known rendering the mind thoroughly quiescent and cutting off the fire of the bond of desire i am pure consciousness alone\n i have set at rest youghts good and bad am wiyout worry rid of ideation of the pleasant and the unpleasant i am pure consciousness alone\n discarding the idea of oneself and another taking no sides in worldly happenings and clinging to the atman as an adamantine pillar i am steady\n i remain in my consciousness which is pure and wiyout hopes freed from desires and non desires and devoid of both the undesirable and the desirables\n when shall i get the inward joy while remaining in the state of self luminosity when shall i be in a mountain cave with my mind quiescent \n when shall i attain similarity to a stone by pracit ising distinctionless deep meditation nirvikalpasamadhi when while remaining dumb by the peace of partless meditation birds of the forest will build their leafy nests on my head \n having cut the trees of ideation and the creepers of intense desire of the forest of the mind and having reached the broad plains of spiritual wisdom i enjoy life happily\n i follow that path of wisdom i am alone unencumbered with attachments i am successful in realizing the truth i am liberated i am wiyout desire i am partless and i desire nothing\n the states of purity strength reality heartiness truth true knowledge bliss tranquillity the rise of constant joy fullness true richness the possession of effulgence and true oneness the mendicant monk thus thinking on the true nature of his self and realizing his true nature freedom doubts indeed became the one wiyout an alternative i\n became one with brahman \n if one sorely afflicted recovers renunciation in the prescribed order should be embraced\n an ascetic shall not converse with a low caste woman one fallen from virtue and a woman in he courses\n the ascetic has no worship of gods nor witnessing temple festivals\n the goal of asceticism is not one and the same heaven\n the sorely afflicted and the kutichaka ascetics gain the worlds bhur and the bhuvas respectively\n the bahudaka ascetic gains heaven svarga \n the hamsa ascetic the world of truth satya loka \n the turiyatita and the avadhuta ascetics attain supreme bliss in themselves by deeply meditating on the true nature of the self according to the maxim of the wasp\n the practice of scripture study which is distinct from meditation on the nature of the self is useless like carrying saffron flowers which are but a burden to a camel\n the ascetic has not to pracit ise the science of yoga or the sankhya he has no rituals with mantras and tantras nor the study of any other religious treait ise shastra if there is it is like adorning a corpse\n such an ascetic is far away from spiritual lore like a cobbler\n a mendicant monk shall not mention his name in the previous stage of life \n one reaps the fruit of whatever action one does\n hence the ascetic shall give up all as one would discard the foam on castor oil\n there is no receiving of the offerings made to a deity\n he shall not worship gods externally\n discarding everything apart from the self subsisting on food secured as alms from a number of houses as a bee gathers honey being lean and avoiding increase of fat in his body he shall move about\n he should spend the time eating food secured as alms from a number of houses using his hand or mouth as a vessel\n the sage established in the self should take food which is conducive to the realization of the self\n two quarters of the belly shall be filled with food and one quarter with water the fourth quarter shall be left for the movement of air\n he shall always live on alms he shall never eat food secured as alms from one house alone he should go particularly to those houses where the people are seen to be easy in mind i\n those who dine only after giving alms \n he may expect alms from four or seven houses where the house holder perform religious rites he may expect alms up to the period of milking cows in the afternoon when he has come out of a house wiyout alms he shall not go in again\n fasting is preferable to getting food from devotees unsolicited food is better than fasting begging alms is preferable to unsolicited food hence he shall subsist on alms\n he shall never enter a house by a side entrance at the time of begging alms he shall not out of delusion go across a house where no harm is seen in so doing\n he shall not beg alms from a vedic scholar if it is given wiyout faith and devotion he may beg alms from the house of a twice born who has lost caste when offered with faith and devotion\n alms from a number of houses wiyout planning that which is planned the one unbegged the timely one and the one offered at the monastery are declared to be the five kinds of alms\n the first kind alms from a number of houses is declared to be that which is obtained from there five or seven houses wiyout pre meditation as in the case of a honeybee from flowers \n the second kind alms previously arranged is that which is accepted after repeated requests made by devotees in that morning and the previous day none the less he may subsist on that\n the third kind alms unbegged is that which is received when invited to dine by some one or other as he is ready to go abegging this should be eaten by ascetics desiring salvation \n the fourth kind timely alms is known as that meal which is offered by a brahmana when he has approached a house for alms this food should be eaten by ascetics\n sages desiring liberation say that the fifth kind of alms the food offered to the ascetic at the monastery is the ready meal which is brought by a brahmana to the monastery\n the ascetic shall subsist on alms by begging from door to door even yough it may be from the houses of outcastes\n he shall not dine in one house even if the host is equal to the preceptor of the gods in learning \n he shall subsist on alms solicited or unsolicited\n air is not spoiled by touching any object fire by the activity of burning waters by urine and faeces getting into them and a mendicant monk by short comings in food\n when in houses smoke has subsided the pestle for pounding rice is at rest the fire in the oven has gone out and the people have dined the ascetic shall go for alms in the late afternoon\n he shall receive alms except from the accursed the fallen heretics and the class of people exclusively engaged in temple worship from all the castes in difficult times\n he shall consider clarified butter as dog s urine honey as spirituous liquor oil as hog s urine condiment as garlic cakes made of black gram as beef and milk as urine\n therefore the ascetic shall avoid by putting forth all effort clarified butter etc\n the yogin shall never eat food mixed with clarified butter condiments etc\n using his hand as a vessel he shall not go about for alms more than once a day \n when the ascetic seeks food with his mouth alone like a cow he becomes equanimous to all hence he becomes fit for immortality\n the ascetic shall discard clarified butter like blood taking food in one house like flesh using cosmetics like smearing himself with unclean things salt and molasses like an outcaste garment like dirty dishes oil bath like courting women pleasant company of friends like urine desire like beef familiar places like the hut of an outcaste women like snakes gold like deadly poison an assembly hall like a cemetery the capital city like hell and food in one house like the balls of rice at a funeral\n there is no worship of gods by him \n discarding the way of the world he shall become one liberated while living \n stay continuously in one place acquisition of begging bowl collecting of staff etc\n gathering disciples sleep by day time divasvapnah and useless talk these are the six sins of ascetics\n remaining continuously in one place except during the rains is said to be a stay asana \n acquisition of even a single vessel like the afore said vessel of gourd etc\n for daily use by an ascetic is said to be acquiring vessels patralopa \n collecting samchaya is declared to be the acceptance of a second staff etc\n for future use by one who has one already\n the acceptance of disciples for personal service profit dignity or fame and not out of compassion to help them is said to be gathering disciples sishyasamgraha \n vedantic learning is called day as it is illuminating ignorance avidya is said to be night\n negligence in learning is said to be sleep during day divasvapnah \n excepting talk pertaining to the self and at the time of receiving alms bestowal of blessings and inquiries concerning the self any other talk is said to be useless talk vrithajalpah \n food from one house pride envy adorning with cosmetics and flowers chewing betel roll oil bath sport desire for enjoyment medicine to prolong life and retard old age rashayana \n boasting abusive language pronouncement of benediction astrological prediction buying and selling ritual debate on ritual transgression of the guru and scripture conciliating fighting vehicle cot white garment release of semen sleep by day time vessel for alms alms bowl gold gum myrrh weapon seed for cultivation or mystical letter forming the essential part of the mantra of a deity injuring severity copulation what is discarded by the yoga of renunciation vows such as the duties of house holder \n branch of the veda of his early days all families of the father and mother and wealth all these are prohibited to the ascetic\n if he resorts to them he falls from the state of renunciation \n a wise man yough very old shall not trust in women yough very old\n even in very old patched garments old cloth will stick when stitched \n immovable property mobile things servants seed for cultivation gold gum myrrh and weapon these six an ascetic shall not take up as yough they were urine and faeces\n an ascetic shall not take with him even a little provision for a journey except when in danger in hard times he may receive ripe corn when cooked food is not available\n a mendicant monk who is not sick and a young monk shall not stay in any house of a householder he shall neither accept nor give anything to another at any time\n with a sense of humility the ascetic shall strive for the welfare of beings begging cooked or uncooked food for another he falls from asceticism \n an ascetic keen on feeding others who accepts clothes etc\n and woollen garments or others as well as good clothes undoubtedly falls from virtue \n resorting to the ship of non duality he will gain liberation while living\n for restraint in speech he shall observe silence for control over the body he shall fast for control over the mind breath control pranayama is prescribed\n a being is bound by worldly action he gets liberated by spiritual knowledge\n hence far seeing ascetics do not perform worldly action\n scattered are torn garments on roads alms can be had everywhere the earth is a wide bed how then are ascetics put to

mendicant monk\n who is entitled to renunciation what are the characteristics of a mendicant monk who is a paramahamsa monk how is his mendicancy pray expound to me all this\n the lord adinarayana then replied the person entitled to renunciation is the wise one who has undergone the difficult course of learning the sacred lores from a good preceptor has understood all the exertion necessary for happiness in this world and the next has understood the need to discard as vomit the three primary desires the three primary inclinations regard for the body etc\n mine ness and egoit ism has completed studentship in celibacy which is the means to reach the path of liberation and has become a householder\n from the stage of a householder he shall become a forest dweller vanaprastha and

disciple or fellow lodger and then renounce the world \n some law givers prescribe the sacrifice called prajapatya of which the god brahma is the presiding deity prior to a twice born embracing renunciation \n but yough thus prescribed he may not do so\n he shall only perform the sacrifice agneyi whose presiding deity is agni the god of fire \n for agni is the vital breath prana \n thereby he does i\n strengthens the vital breath\n then he shall perform the traidhataviya sacrifice whose presiding deity is the god indra \n by this sacrifice the three vital fluids namely the sattva semen rajas blood and tamas the dark one become strong like fire \n having performed the sacrifice in the prescribed manner he shall smell the holy fire reciting the following mantra oh fire this vital breath is your source as you are born at the proper time of the year you put on effulgence\n knowing him the atman your ultimate source may you merge with the prana your source \n may you increase our

mantra says\n having procured the holy fire from the house of a well versed vedic scholar he shall smell the holy fire in the manner described previously\n if he is afflicted by illness or does not get the holy fire he shall offer the oblation in the waters\n for water is presided over by all the gods\n reciting i offer the oblation to all gods svaha he shall tender the oblation and picking up a small portion of the offered oblation which is mixed with ghee he shall eat this as it is beneficial\n in the case of the kshatriyas and others not entitled to renunciation the rule is that they may seek liberation in the path of the brave by courting death in battle field or fast unto death as a discipline or enter into water to rise no more or enter fire or undertake the great journey in which they collapse by exhaustion \n if he were afflicted by illness he may renounce mentally or by speech reciting mantras \n this is the path of their renunciation \n a healyour person if desiring to

own form again recite mentally or in speech the pranava and the vyahriit is separately and utter three times three the farewell words i have renounced i have renounced i have renounced in gentle middling and sharp tones deeply engage in meditation on the pranava and raise his hand saying freedom from fear to all from me svaha \n he shall then start for the north thinking over the meaning of

and then the texts freedom from fear to all beings every thing emanates from me you are my friend and you guard me\n you are the source of strength\n you are the vajra weapon of indra which killed the demon vritra\n be a blessing to me\n prevent that which is a sin \n reciting this mantra preceded by the pranava he shall take up the emblematic bamboo staff and water pot and wear the waist band loincloth and a discoloured i\n ochre coloured garment then approach a good guru bow to him and receive from the mouth of the guru the great scriptural text that thou art preceded by the pranava\n

favourite desire in the atman become free of mine ness and get established in the self give up passion anger greed delusion intoxication rivalry false pride pride egoit ism intolerance arrogance desires hatred gloating impetuosity mine ness etc\n possessed of wisdom and dispassion he shall turn away from wealth and women and possessing a pure mind he shall ponder over the truths of all the upanishads guard bestowing particular care his celibacy non possession universe injuring attitude and truthfulness conquer his senses and be free from affection externally and internally secure alms for sustaining the body like a harmless cow from members of the four castes excepting those who are accursed and fallen such a person is considered woryour of realizing brahman\n he shall view with

brahman in the form of pranava in investigating on the nature of the self\n he who thus gives up his body by resorting to renunciation is the paramahamsa mendicant monk\n the god brahma asked narayana lord what is brahma pranava the lord narayana replied the brahma pranava consists of sixteen parts and it is cognized in quadruples in the four states waking etc\n in the waking state there are the

has discarded all worldly activities how is he solely devoted to absorption in brahman how is he a brahmana thus the god brahma asked narayana \n lord vishnu then replied oh child he who has knowledge of the non dual atman has the real sacred thread i\n that knowledge itself is the sacred thread \n his deep absorption in meditation is itself the tuft\n this activity is itself the possession of the sanctifying ring of holy grass pavitra \n he does all actions he is the brahmana he is deeply absorbed in brahman he is the illumined being deva he is the sage he pracit ises penance he is the noblest

a great man maha purusha has his mind resting in me\n i too remain in him alone\n he is the ever sait isfied\n he is free from the effects of cold and heat happiness and misery honour and dishonour\n he puts up with insult and anger\n he is devoid of the six human infirmities hunger and thirst sorrow and delusion old age and death and is free from the six properties of the body birth existence change growth decay and death \n he is wiyout the intervention of i\n he is not circumscribed by the state of elderliness or otherwise\n excepting the self he sees nothing else\n clothed by the points of the compass bowing to none not uttering svaha as he worships no gods not uttering svadha to propitiate the manes wiyout the need to send back gods as they have not been invoked free from blame and praise not resorting to mantras and rituals not meditating on other gods than the supreme god refraining from aims and their absence with all activities ceased firmly established in consciousness consisting of existence knowledge and bliss being conscious of the one supreme bliss he ever meditates on the brahma pranava to the effect that he is brahman alone and thus fulfils himself such a one

sovereignty over the empire of emancipation\n you have done well nidagha listen to the eternal science by the knowledge of which alone will you be liberated life\n lodged in om that envelopes the root of phenomena brahman supporting the syllable aim eternal bliss independent hrim renowned with streaming stresses sauh the ruler of the world srim mahalakshmi at once desire klim fulfilment and humanity is the divine annapurna\n i begged of her using the celebrated and quintessential incantation of syllables cultivated by hosts of female ascetics namely aim hrim sauh srim klim aum namo bhagavatyannapurne mamabhilashitam annam dehi svaha\n salutation o divine annapurna vouchsafe the food i desire thus have i been instructed by my father\n from then on have i established myself in this discipline persisting in the activities of my station in life and have given myself up to the daily practice of this incantation\n when many days passed thus there appeared in front of me annapurna wide eyed her lotus face beaming with a smile\n seeing her i prostrated flat on the ground and then stood up with folded hands\n well child you have done well ask of me a boon delay not\n oh nidagha best of sages thus hidden by the wide eyed deity i spoke o daughter of the mountain may the truth of the self dawn on my mind \n saying be it so she vanished then and there\n then through the perception of the world s variety the idea mati arose in me\n delusion appears five fold it will be presently set forth\n due to the first delusion jiva and god appear to have different forms\n due to the second the attribute of agency dwelling in the self appears to be real\n the third consists in deeming the jiva associated with the three bodies as having attachment\n the fourth takes the world cause god to be mutable\n the fifth delusion ascribes reality to the world as distinguished from its cause\n then also in the mind flashes the cessation of the five fold delusion\n from that moment spontaneously my mind was assimilated to brahman\n o nidagha thus may you too secure knowledge of reality\n with humility and respect nidagha spoke to ribhu impart to me having faith in you the peerless science of brahman\n gratified ribhu said so be it \n i shall impart to you the knowledge of reality o sinless one\n be a mighty agent ardent enjoyer and a great renouncer\n having this investigated your own real nature be happy\n i am brahman ever manifest pure first endless there is no room for the slightest dallying with aught else thus think having become blemishless achieve nirvana permanent peace having purified and quietened all movements of the mind\n know that none of the things seen here is there it is all like the city in the sky and water in the desert \n on the other hand what is nowhere seen at all is not given as an object beyond the range of the sixth sense mind o sage assimilate yourself to that\n grasp i am that which is the indestructible infinite spirit the self of everything integral replete abundant and partless\n due to the absolute contemplation of absence or nihil when the mind dwindles there results the state of the being in general satta samanya of that whose essence is unqualified consciousness\n surely devoid of all objective tinge when consciousness chit subsides there supervenes the exceedingly transparent being in general that resembles non being\n for the liberated self both embodied and disembodied surely there occurs this ultimate perception known as the state beyond the fourth\n o sinless one this occurs in the case of the knower both when he has risen from concentration samadhi and when he is established in it being born of awareness this does not happen for the ignorant alone\n all waverings between states of reasoning etc\n having vanished long since his face steeped in the lovely light of brahmic bliss the sage attains the blessed state through right knowledge alone\n the inner cool calm repose of him who perceives this multitude of gunas as non self is said to be concentration\n the steady mind is empty of latent impulses the same is the state of contemplation\n the same also is aloneness\n besides it is nothing but perpetual quiescence\n the mind with attenuated latent impulses is said to be bound for the highest state\n next the mind wiyout such impulses attains the status of the non doer\n on the other hand the mind s imagination of being the doer is replete with latent impulses it causes all sufferings therefore attenuated latent impulses\n when the imagination of unity with all objects is mentally discarded due to its constant introverted state all things are resolved into empty space\n as crowds in a market yough active are as good as non existent to the observer when he is not related to them so too to the knower is a village like unto a forest\n being inwardly withdrawn the knower either asleep awake walking or reading beholds a city country side or village as if it were no other than a forest i\n once the inner cool is won the world is cool\n to those scorched by the inner thirst the world is afire\n for all unliberated beings what is within is projected externally\n but the lover of the inner self yough operating through the organs of action is unaffected by joy and sorrow he is said to be concentrated\n he who as a matter of course and not through fear beholds all beings as one s own self and others possessions as clods of earth alone sees aright\n let death come now or at the end of cycles he remains unblemished as gold fallen in mire\n consider in your mind who am i how is all this brought about how do death and birth happen thus considering will you earn the great benefit of investigation \n your mind will shed its discursive form and quietly win repose once through investigation you comprehend your real nature\n o brahmin your mind cured of its feverishness no more sinks in empirical activities as an elephant does not in the hollow made by a cow s hoof\n but a petty mind o brahmin does sink in any petty affair just as a battered mosquito does in the water collected in the hollow made by a cow s hoof\n o best of ascetics to the extent all objects are readily renounced the supreme self the transcendent light alone remains\n so long as all objects are not renounced the self is not won\n what remains after the renunciation of the entire objective manifold is said to be the self\n therefore in order to realize the self renounce everything\n having cast off all objects assimilate yourself to that which remains\n whatever object is beheld in the world around is but the vibration of consciousness it is nothing permanent\n o brahmin by the term samadhi concentration the wise denote transcendent understanding that is concentrated eternally appeased and is cognisant of things as they are\n the term concentration denotes the stable mountain like status of the self that is unagitated unegoistic and unrelated to dualities\n o brahmin it denotes the perfected flow of the mind that is sure choiceless and goalless\n the best of the knowers of the vedas the great ones win that fourth and stable perception that is fashioned solely through a part of the light of the spirit\n it is lodged in the heart of all things and not altogether unlike dreamless slumber when the mind and the ego subside\n after liquidating the mind with the mind that state that supremely divine bliss body is automatically won\n thence follows the obliteration of all cravings for objects then dawns the auspicious and superbly splendid light and then in the case of the very best due to the sway of even mindness takes place the ineffable transformation into the self s substance\n directly experienced indeed as the god of gods and self of all entities moving and stationary is this total and infinite reality of the self dwelling in the fast evolving mind that is quietened externally\n the unattached steady and controlled mind is not in evidence in the worldings the attached mind yough subjected to long drawn austerities is as it were altogether bound\n the man free from inner clingings whose mind dwells on the blissful brahman may or may not act externally never can he be either agent or experiencer\n nidagha what is attachment like what kind of it leads to human bondage and what kind of it is said to liberate how is this attachment cured ribhu imagination ignoring wholly the distinction between the body and the embodied self the exclusive faith in the body is the attachment that is said to bind\n all this is self what shall i seek here and what avoid know this to be the position of nonattachment that the jivanmukta fosters\n i am not none other than me is neither this nor the non other exists\n this attitude is said to be non attachment always maintaining i am brahman \n he does not approve of inactivity neither does he cling to activities\n he the renouncer is the superbly equable in outlook he is said to be the non attached\n one who mentally and not in the concrete act alone renounces fruits etc\n of all his activities that adept is said to be non attached\n imaginations and the manifold activities issuing therefrom are cured here by non indulgence in imagination thus promote well being\n the mind that clings not to acts youghts and things to wanderings and reckonings of time but reposes in consciousness alone finding no delight anywhere even when turned toward some objects revels in the self\n let him perform or not all this empirical activity doing or non doing his true occupation is selfdelight\n or giving up even that objective element as stabilised consciousness the tranquillised jiva abides in the self like a radiant gem\n the quiescent state of the attenuated mind free from all objective reference is said to be the deep sleep in wakefulness\n this state of slumber o nidagha fully developed through practice is styled the fourth by the best knowers of truth\n having attained the indestructible status in this fourth stage one reaches a non blissful poise as it were its nature being invariably delightful\n thence lifted above all relativities like non bliss and great bliss the time less yogin reaching the state beyond the fourth is said to be liberated\n with all bonds of birth loosened and all tamasic conceits dissolved the great sage abides as the blissful being of the supreme self like a salt crystal in water\n that which is the trans empirical and experiential reality present in the contrasted perceptions of the material and the conscious is the essence brahman is said to be that\n bondage is encompassed by the object on release from this liberation is said to supervene\n resting in that unvexed experience discriminated in the link between the substance and perception abide you thus one attains the peace of deep sleep\n that develops into the fourth station your gaze on that\n the self is neither gross nor subtle neither manifest nor hidden neither spiritual nor material neither non being nor being\n that non dual indestructible one which has become the object the ground of mind and all senseorgans is neither i nor another neither one nor many\n that real joy experienced in the relation between the object and perception is the transcendental state therefore it is as it were nothing in itself \n liberation is not on the top of the sky not in the nether world not on the earth\n the dwindling of mind in which all desires dry up is held to be liberation\n with the yought within let me have liberation the mind springs up this worldly bondage is firm in the mind agitated with yought\n the mere non cleansing of the mind reduces it to a state of prodigious transmigration its cleansing alone on the other hand is said to be liberation\n what is bondage and what is liberation in respect of the self that transcends all things or that pervades all forms think freely\n loving the spirit lifted above all hopes full holy in mind having won the incomparable state of repose he seeks nothing here\n he is called the jivanmukta liberated in life who lives unattached in the pure being that sustains all the indubitable spirit that is the self\n he craves not for what is yet to be he does not bank on the present he remembers not the past yet he does all work\n ever unattached to those who cling to him devoted to the devotees he is harsh as it were to the harsh\n a child amidst children adult amidst adults bold amidst the bold a youth amidst the youthful lamenting amidst those who lament steadfast blissful polished of holy speech wise simple and sweet never given to self pity through discipline when the throb of vital breaths ceases the mind is wholly dissolved the impersonal bliss nirvana remains whence all discursive speech turns back\n with the obliteration of all of one s mental constructions that brahmic status abides\n here is the supreme self whose essence is the light of consciousness wiyout beginning or end the wise hold this luminous certitude to be the right knowledge\n the plenitude due to the knowledge all the world is self alone is the right measure of selfrealization everywhere in the world\n all is self alone what are the empirical states being and non being where have they fled where are those notions of bondage and liberation what stands out is brahman alone\n all is the one supreme sky\n what is liberation what is bondage this is the great brahman established mightily with extended form duality has vanished far from it be you yourself the self alone\n when the form of a stock stone and cloth is seen aright there is not even a shadow of difference bent on imagination of differences where are you this imperishable and tranquil essence present at the beginning and end of things and yourself always be that\n with mental distinctions of duality and non duality and delusions of old age and death the self alone shines in its phases atmabhih just as the sea in its phases of waves\n what enjoyment of the desired fruits can disturb him who dwells steadfast ever wedded in yought to the pure self that fells the tree of dangers to the status of bliss supreme mental enjoyments are the foes of one who has yought extensively they move him not in the least just as gentle breezes move not a hill at all\n plurality exists in diverse imaginings not really within just as there is nothing but water in a lake a man filled with this one certitude is said to be liberated he who has perceived the real\n nidagha what is the nature of liberation wiyout the body who is the great sage in possession of it resorting to which yoga has he achieved that supreme status ribhu in the region of sumeru the celebrated sage mandavya resorting to truth imparted by kaundinya became liberated in life\n having attained the status of jivanmukti that foremost knower of brahman that great sage made up his mind once upon a time to withdraw all his sense organs from their respective objects \n he sat in the lotus posture with eyes half closed slowly avoiding contacts with objects external and internal\n then he with his sinless mind reflected on the degree of steadiness of his mind clearly yough withdrawn this mind of mine is extremely restless \n it wanders from a cloth to a pot and thence to a big cart\n the mind wanders among objects as a monkey does from tree to tree\n the five openings eyes and so forth known as the sense organs of cognition i am watching carefully with my mind\n o you sense organs slowly give up your mood of agitation\n here i am the divine spiritual self the witness of all\n with that all knowing self i have comprehended the nature of eyes etc\n i am completely secure and at peace\n luckily i am fearless\n incessantly i rest in my self the fourth my vital breaths its extensions have all in due order subsided within\n i am as a fire with its multitudinous flames when the fuel has been consumed it blazed forth but now is extinguished the blazing fire has indeed been extinguished\n having been purified utterly i remain equable enjoying all alike as it were\n i am awake yough in deep sleep yough in deep sleep i am awake\n resorting to the fourth i remain within the body with a stable status having abandoned together with the long thread of sound reaching upto om objects in all the three worlds fashioned by imagination\n as a bird for flying in the sky leaves the net in which it was enmeshed the great sage sheds his identification with the sense organs then he sheds his awareness of limbs which has become illusory\n he has won the knowledge of a new born infant as if the air should give up its power to vibrate he has terminated the proneness of consciousness to attach itself to objects\n then attaining the unqualified state of consciousness the state of pure being resorting as it were to the state of dreamless slumber he has stayed immovable like a mountain\n winning the stability of dreamless sleep he has attained the fourth yough gone beyond bliss he is still blissful he has become both being and non being\n then he becomes that which is beyond even the range of words which is the nihil of the nihilist and brahman of the knowers of brahman which is the pure blemishless cognition of the knowers of cognition the purusha of the sankhyas and ishvara of the yogins the shiva of the shivagamas the time of those who affirm time alone as the basic principle the final doctrine of all shastras and what conforms to every heart which is the all the all pervading reality the truth\n he has become that the unuttered the moveless the illuminator even of lights the principle whose sole proof is one s experience of it he has remained as that\n that which is unborn deathless beginningless and the first immaculate state whole and impartite he has remained as that a state subtler than that of the sky\n in a moment he has become the hallowed god\n has the jivanmukta characteristics like the power to fly in space etc\n if so great sage it is not present in the perfected man described above \n o brahmin a non knower of the self still in bondage achieves the powers to fly in space etc\n by virtue of specific substances incantations practices and potencies of time\n this is not the concern of the self knower\n one having contentment in one s self never hankers after the phenomena of nescience\n whatever objects are present in the world are held to be of the stuff of nescience\n how can the great yogin who has dispelled nescience plunge into them whichever confounded person or man of little understanding desires the group of yogic powers achieves them one by one through set practices instrumental to them\n substances incantations actions applied at the right time yield yogic powers all right\n none of them lifts man to the status of god\n only influenced by some desire does man work for miraculous powers\n the perfect man seeking nothing can have no desire whatsoever\n when all desires dry up o sage the self is won\n how can the mindless sage desire miraculous powers the man liberated in life would feel no surprise were the sun to radiate cool light the moon scorching rays or the fire to blaze downwards\n the whole world is superimposed on the supreme reality the ground as the snake is on the rope\n no curiosity is aroused as regards these superimposed wonders\n those indeed who have known what is to be known and shed all attachments whose intellect is great the knots of whose hearts have been cut are free yough living in the body\n dead is his mind who is unmoved in joy and sorrow and whom nothing jerks out of equality even as breaths stir not a mighty mountain\n dead is the mind of one who is undisturbed by danger resourcelessness energy hilarity dullness or great rejoicing\n the destruction of mind is twofold determinate and indeterminate\n in the state of liberation in life it is determinate in that of disembodied liberation it is indeterminate\n the presence of mind makes for sorrow its destruction promotes joy\n attenuate the existent mind and bring about its destruction\n the nature of mind know is folly o sinless one when that perishes one s real essence mindlessness is won \n the mind of one liberated in life having qualities like friendliness etc\n is rich in noble impulses it is never reborn\n this destruction of the jivanmukta s mind is determinate nidagha with disembodied liberation comes indeterminate destruction\n one liberated in disembodiment is he who realizes the partless self his mind the abode of all excellent qualities as it was is dissolved\n in that supremely holy blemishless status of disembodied liberation marked by mindlessness in that state of indeterminate destruction of the mind just nothing remains neither qualities nor their absence neither glory nor its absence nothing whatsoever of the world neither sunrise nor sunset neither sensations of joy or anger neither light nor darkness neither twilight day nor night neither being non being nor centrality marks the status of disembodied liberation \n the spacious status of those who are liberated in disembodiment who have gone beyond intellect and the pomp of worldly life is like the sky the abode of the winds\n the great jivanmuktas whose bodies are the subtle ether become disembodied there in the state of disembodied liberation all their sufferings are cured they are immaterial totally quiescent immobilized in bliss beyond rajas and tamas\n in that state dissolve the remnants of their mind\n o great sage nidagha rid your mind of all latent tendencies concentrate your mind forcefully and go beyond all mental constructions\n that eternally self shining light illuminating the world is alone the witness of this world the self of all the pure one\n as massed intelligence it is the ground of all beings\n that non dual brahman characterised by truth knowledge and bliss is the object of knowledge\n the sage fulfils his duty with the realization i am the one brahman brahman is the ground of all non dual supreme eternal of the essence of being intelligence and bliss beyond the range of word and mind\n there shine not the forms of the moon and the sun the winds blow not and none of the gods are there \n this divinity alone shines forth as being pure by itself free from rajas\n the knot of the heart is split all doubts are cut asunder\n all his actions dwindle when he who is both here and beyond is seen\n in this body are the birds called the jiva and the lord dwelling together\n of them the jiva eats the fruit of action not the great lord\n alone as the witness wiyout participation the great lord shines by himself\n through maya is set up the difference between them\n spirit is other than its form as it does not dwindle the spirit is non different from all objects \n as the unity of the spirit is established through reasoning and means of right knowledge once that unity is comprehensively known one no more sorrows nor is one deluded\n having the certain knowledge i am the ground of the whole world solid truth and knowledge the sage may dispel all sorrow\n those whose flaws have all been attenuated realize in their own bodies the witness of all whose essence is self luminous being not those others who are encompassed by maya\n knowing him alone let the intelligent brahmana build up wisdom let him not dwell on a multitude of words that only makes for verbal weariness\n having mastered the knowledge of brahman let him live in childlikeness alone\n having mastered both brahman knowledge and childlikeness the sage possesses the self\n know the elemental body as the seed of the creeper of samsara the transmigratory life with its immense sprouts good and evil having their potencies latent in the body \n of this body the seed is the mind conforming to cravings it is a sheath of active and quiescent moods a casket holding the gem of pain\n the tree of the mind has two seeds one is the vibration of the vital breath the other obstinate imagination\n when the vital breath aroused by nervous contacts vibrates at once the mind is transformed into a mass of sensations\n that all pervading awareness is aroused by the vibration of the vital breath\n it is better to suppress the awareness of objects less harmful is the vibration of the vital breath etc\n for mental peace the yogins suppress vital breaths through breath control meditation and practices dictated by reasoning\n know the supreme cause yielding the fruit of mental peace namely the joyful self abidance of cognition that is known as breath control\n latent impression is said to consist in the seizing of an object by the force of entrenched imagination despite all considerations of cause and effect\n rejecting everything and imagining nothing either to be chosen or rejected the mind remains in itself now is the mind unborn\n being continuously free from latent impressions when the mind ceases to ponder there arises mindlessness that yields supreme tranquillity\n when no aspect of objects in the world is imagined how can the mind be born in the empty sky of the heart the conception of a thing s absence is based on its non being mindlessness is posited with reference to the object as such\n the mind abiding coolly in itself after the inner rejection of all objects yough in modifications is still held to have the form of non being\n they indeed are deemed liberated in life whose latent unenjoyed impressions are like the fried seeds incapable of sprouting any more\n their minds have acquired the form of sattva they have gone beyond the farther shore of knowledge they are said to be mindless\n with the fall of their bodies they become sky like\n due to rejection of objects both the vibrations of vital breaths and latent impressions swiftly perish as does a tree whose root is cut off\n in this state of cognition whatever appears either as experienced before or as altogether new must be meticulously wiped out by every one whose knowledge is sound\n the vast transmigratory life is due to the failure to obliterate them on the contrary liberation is held to be just their obliteration\n be immaterial spiritual rejecting all pleasures and cognitions\n knowledge depends on the states of objects one having no knowledge is non cognitive yough he performs a hundred actions he is held to be non inert\n he is said to be liberated in life the clear sphere of whose emotions is not in the least affected by objects his knowledge is spiritual\n due to the absence of latent impressions in the mind when nothing is imagined it remains steady with cognitions similar to those of children and the dumb\n now the sage is no longer affected for he resorts to the vast intelligent non knowing in the objective mode \n through the concentration of modelessness rejecting all latent impressions he becomes one with it in the infinite even that is dissolved\n though standing walking touching smelling the intelligent sage devoid of all clingings gets rid of fluctuating pleasures and the cognitions of the particulars he is at peace\n a shoreless ocean of excellences he crosses the sea of sufferings because he resorts to this vision even in the midst of vexed activities\n devoid of all particular the stainless pure being is one vast essence that is held to be the abode of immutable existence\n rejecting distinctions like the being of time the being of instants the being of entities be solely devoted to pure being\n contemplating but one unqualified universal being be omnipresent full supremely blissful filling up all space\n the pristine inconceivable status wiyout beginning and end that remains at the fringe of universal being is causeless\n it remains beyond the possibility of doubts\n a man who reaches that returns to pains no more\n it is the cause of all beings itself has no cause\n it is the quintessence of all essences nothing is more quintessential that it\n in that vast mirror of intelligence all these perceptions of objects are reflected as the trees on the bank are reflected in the lake\n that is the pure unobscured truth of the self when that is known the mind is tranquillised\n having through knowledge won its essence you become truly free from the fear of samsara\n by the application of the remedies mentioned by me for the causes of suffering that supreme status is attained\n o knower of truth if by manly endeavour you forcefully eschew latent impressions and establish yourself all alone in that indestructible status even for a moment at the very summit of universal being well at this very moment you achieve it all right or if you sedulously cultivate the status of universal being that status you will attain with somewhat greater effort\n nidagha if you stay meditating on the principle of cognition through still greater effort you will win that exalted status\n or sir if you strive to shed latent impressions know that till the mind is dissolved the latent impressions too are not attenuated\n as long as the latent impressions are not attenuated the mind is not tranquillised as long as the knowledge of truth is not won whence can come mental tranquillity as long as the mind is not tranquil truth cannot be known so long as the knowledge of truth is not won whence can mental tranquillity come knowledge of truth mind s destruction attenuation of latent impressions these mutually cause one another they are indeed hard to accomplish\n therefore flinging far from you the desire for enjoyment cultivate this triad\n high souled one sought for long and simultaneously the attenuation of latent impressions knowledge of truth and the destruction of the mind are held to prove effective\n by means of these three cultivated aright the tough knots of the heart are shattered wiyout residue as are their threads when the lotus stalks are crushed\n truth knowers know that breath control corresponds to the eschewal of latent impressions therefore also pracit ise this latter too by breath control\n by eschewing latent impressions the mind ceases to be also by obstructing the vibrations of the vital breath it does so do the one or the other as you choose\n by the steady practice of breath control the exercise of reasoning taught by the teacher the practice of yogic postures and the regulation of diet the vibration of breath is obstructed\n through behaviour wiyout attachment avoidance of contemplation of birth and empirical life and the perception of the decline of the body latent impressions cease to operate\n the vibration of the vital breath is indeed the same as mind s vibration\n the intelligent man should strive hard to conquer vibrations of the vital breath\n wiyout sound reasoning it is impossible to conquer the mind\n resorting to pure cognition and rejecting attachment be steady\n o great souled one abide solely in the heart contemplating wiyout conceptions the pristine single matchless and indubitable status of cognition wiyout objects but perform action having achieved the status of inactivity in the blaze of tranquil glory\n the man who through ratiocination in however small a measure has slain his mind has achieved the object of his life\n he is said to be dead whose mind is not given over to investigation when he walks or stands when he is awake or sleep\n know the spirit in itself to be of the nature of the light of right knowledge\n it is fearless neither subjugated nor depressed\n the knower digests whatever food he eats whether it is impure unwholesome defiled through contact with poison well cooked or stale as yough it were sweet i\n the wise know liberation to be the renunciation of all attachment non birth results from it\n give up attachment to objects be liberated in life o sinless one attachment is held to be the impure impressions causing reactions like joy and indignation when the objects sought after are present or absent\n pure is the impression latent in the bodies of the liberated in life which does not lead to rebirth and is untainted by elation or depression\n o nidagha pains do not depress you joys do not elate you abandoning servitude to desires be unattached\n undetermined by space and time beyond the purview of is and is not there is but brahman the pure indestructible spirit quiescent and one there is nothing else \n thus thinking with a body at once present and absent be liberated the silent man uniform with quiescent mind delighting in the self\n there is neither mind stuff nor mind neither nescience nor jiva\n manifest is the one brahman alone like the sea wiyout beginning or end\n the illusory perception of mind etc\n continues as long as the i sense is bound up with the body objects are mistaken for the self and the sense of possession expressed as this is mine persists\n sage illusory perceptions of mind etc\n vanish for one who through introversion internally burns up in the fire of the spirit the dry grass that is this three fold world\n i am the self that is the spirit i am impartite\n i have neither cause not effect\n remember your vast infinite form through memory do not be finitized\n by means of the mantra incantation of the spiritual science contemplated within the deadly disease of craving dwindles as does mist in autumn\n the sages hold that the best form of renunciation namely that of latent impressions by virtue of knowledge is the status of aloneness as it is pure universal being\n where latent impressions remain in solution there is deep sleep it does not make for perfection\n where the impressions are seedless there is the fourth that yields perfection\n even a very small residue of latent impressions of fire debt disease and adversaries of attachment enmity and poison affects one adversely\n with the seeds of latent impressions consumed and conformed to universal being with or wiyout a body one no more partakes of sufferings\n the decision this is not brahman is the sum total of nescience whose extinction consists in the opposite decision this is brahman \n brahman is spirit brahman is the world\n brahman is the congregation of beings brahman is myself brahman is the adversary of the spirit brahman is the allies and friends of the spirit\n once it is realized that brahman is all man is brahman indeed one experiences the omnipresent spirit that is peace\n when the mind the guide of unregenerate senses ceases to operate in regard to the alien the immaculate all pervading awareness that remains the brahman intelligence am i\n resort to that intelligent self having discarded all speculations all curiosity all vehemence of feelings\n thus intelligent beings with full knowledge equanimous with minds rid of all attachment neither applaud nor condemn either life or death\n o brahmin the vital breath has the ceaseless power of vibration it always moves\n in this body with its ins and outs this up going vital breath is placed above the down breath too is similar only it is stationed below\n that best breath control that operates in the expert whether awake or asleep listen to an account of that for better being\n puraka is the contact of the body with the up breaths that move forwards from the nostrils through the space of twelve finger breadths\n apana the down breath is the moon that keeps the body in well being o well disciplined sage the up breath is the sun or the fire which internally warms the body\n resort to the spiritual identity of the down and up breaths that dwells near the point where the up breath dwindles and the down breath rises\n resort to that spiritual impartite principle when the down breath has set and for a moment the up breath has not yet arisen\n resort to that spiritual impartite principle at the tip of the nose where the breaths revolve before the down breath sets while the up breath has done so\n these three worlds are only an appearance neither existent nor non existent the consequent renunciation of all concern with an other the wise maintain is right knowledge\n noble brahmin even this appearance is distorted by the mirror of the mind\n therefore giving up that too be rid of all appearances\n uprooting this fearful demon of the mind detrimental to the essence of steadiness remain what you are be steadfast\n the spirit that is beyond cause and effect and is likened to the boundless sky is incapable of confrontation by any real object it remains at the end of all mental processes\n the sait isfaction felt at the moment of desire is caused by that very desire\n this sait isfaction lasts only till discontent sets in therefore reject desire\n reduce desire to desirelessness let conceptions cease let mind grow into mindlessness in the process of your life wiyout attachment\n acting through sense organs free from the force of latent impulses like the sky you would not alter yough there be a yousand disturbances\n due to the activity and the inactivity of the mind does empirical life start and subside\n through the suppression of latent impulses and the vital breath reduce the mind to inactivity\n due to the activity and inactivity of the vital breaths does empirical life start and subside\n through drill and application reduce it to inactivity\n due to the active and passive phases of ignorance do activities get started and cease\n dissolve it ignorance forcefully by winning a teacher and the instructions of the shastras\n by a mere quiver of the non objective knowledge or by the suppression of vital breaths is mind reduced to mindlessness that is the supreme status\n through the perception of brahman infallibly directed to it bliss behold that real bliss occasioned by the visioning of the knowable as brahman \n that indeed is the non factitious bliss which the mind does not reach it is free from decline and growth it neither rises nor sets\n the mind of the knower is not called mind mind indeed is the truth of spirit\n therefore in the fourth state it transcends that state\n having renounced all mental constructions equable and with a quiescent mind be a sage wedded to the yoga of renunciation possessing both knowledge and freedom\n the supreme brahman is that which conforms to no act of mentation\n it is what remains when mental activities completely die down and all masses of latent impulses have been liquidated\n by securing right knowledge and by unremitting concentration those who become enlightened in the wisdom of the upanishads are the sankhyas and the others are the yogins\n those are the yogins versed in yoga who after the quiescence of the breaths through ascetic practices achieve the status above sufferings beginningless and endless\n what is required to be won by all is the uncaused and still status the contemplation of the one changeless real the control of breaths the dwindling of the mind\n when one of them is perfected it helps perfect the others also \n the vital breaths and mind of living beings are all concomitant\n like the container and the content they perish when only one is present\n through self destruction they produce that best of products namely liberation\n if remaining steady you reject all this by understanding then on the cessation of the i sense you yourself are the supreme status\n there is but one great spirit which is called the being it is flawless even pure free from the isense\n it shines forth but once the pure the ever risen the same\n it is described by many names as brahman the supreme self etc\n o nidagha knowing for creation i am that having done what had to be accomplished i never think of the past or the future\n i cling wholly to the vision that is present here and now \n this have i won today i shall achieve this beautiful thing \n i laud not neither do i condemn\n nothing other than the self is anywhere\n the gaining of the good does not gladden me evil betiding me does not sadden me\n sage the waverings of my mind have been totally stilled it is rod of all sorrow\n it is cured of all wantings\n therefore i am hale and untrammelled\n this is a friend that is a foe this is mind that is a stranger this sort of knowledge does not occur to me o brahmin no affection touches me\n rid of all latent impressions the mind is liberated from old age and death\n mind with latent impressions inherent in it is knowledge\n what is to be known is the mind rid of all latent impressions\n when the mind is rejected this duality on all sides is dissolved but remains the tranquil supreme one pure and untrammelled\n the endless unborn unmanifest unageing tranquil unlapsing non dual beginningless and endless which nevertheless is the first apprehension\n one devoid of beginning and end wholly spirit pure pervasive subtler far than the sky you art that brahman indubitably\n undetermined by space time etc\n superlatively pure ever arisen omnipresent this one end is all in all be you that pure spirit\n all is this tranquil one devoid of beginning middle and end\n all is unborn both being and nonbeing so thinking be happy\n i am not bound nor liberated\n i am indeed the untrammelled brahman\n i am free from duality\n i am being intelligence bliss\n keeping far away the entire multitude of objects be you ever devoted to the self your mind all cooled\n this is fine this is not such feeling is the seed of your extended sorrow\n when that is burned in the fire of impartiality where is the occasion for sorrow first augment wisdom by means of familiarity with the shastras and by seeking the company of the holy\n the true real and ultimate brahman superlatively pure eternal wiyout beginning and end is the cure for all forms of transmigratory life\n so also is it neither coarse nor spaced neither tangible nor visible it is tasteless and scentless unknowable and peerless\n well disciplined sage for achieving liberation one should meditate on the bodiless self that is brahman being consciousness and bliss wiyout end as i am that \n concentration is the origination of knowledge in regard to the unity of the supreme and the jiva\n the self verily is eternal omnipresent immutable and flawless\n being but one through maya it splits up not in its essence\n therefore the non dual alone is no manifold no empirical life is there \n just as space is called pot space and great space so due to delusion is the self called jiva and ishvara in two ways\n when the all pervading spirit shines always wiyout a break in the mind of the yogin then one becomes one s self\n verily when one beholds all beings in one s own self and one s self in all beings one becomes brahman\n in the state of concentration atoned with the supreme one beholds no beings one then is the alone\n the first plane generating the desire for liberation is marked by the practice of discipline and detachment due to intimacy with the shastras and the company of the holy\n the second is marked by investigation the third by contemplation with all its accessories the fourth is the solvent as it consists in the dissolution of latent impressions\n the fifth is the rapturous it is purely cognitive\n this is the station of the liberated in life who is as it were half awake and half asleep\n the sixth plane is non cognitive\n it is the station similar to deep sleep having the nature of pure and massive bliss\n the seventh plane is marked by equability utter purity tenderness it is indeed unqualified liberation the quiescent fourth state\n the transcendent state beyond the fourth nirvana in its essence is the transcendent and developed seventh plane it does not come within the purview of mortals\n the first three constitute but the wakeful life the fourth is called the dream state where the world is regrettably dream like\n the fifth conforming to massive bliss is styled deep sleep\n in contrast the sixth which is noncognitive is named the fourth state\n the most excellent seventh plane is the state beyond the fourth beyond the range of mind and words and identified with the self luminous being\n if due to the withdrawal of the cognitive organs into one s self no object is perceived\n one is liberated indeed indubitably by that mighty sameness of vision \n i die not neither do i live being preponderantly non existent i am existent neither\n i am nothing but spirit so thinking the intelligent jivanmukta sorrows not\n stainless am i unageing and unattached with latent impressions all tranquillised\n i am impartite the veritable spirit sky so thinking he sorrows not\n rid of the i sense pure awake unageing immortal peaceful am i all appearances have been quietened for me so thinking he sorrows not\n i am one with him who dwells at the tips of grass in the sky in the sun in man the mountain and the gods so thinking he sorrows not\n discarding all mental constructions about objects rising well above them dwell on the yought i the free am the supreme brahman that remains \n beyond the purview of words rid of the predicament of hankering after objects unagitated even by the flavour of climatic bliss he delights in the self by himself\n renouncing all actions ever content independent neither by virtue sin nor aught else is he stained\n just as a mirror is not stained by reflections so is the b knower inwardly unstained by actions fruits\n freely moving amidst the masses he knows neither pains nor pleasures when his body is tortured or honoured as if these are directed to one s reflections\n beyond praise and change recognising neither worship nor its object at once conforming and indifferent to all codes of etiquette let him give up his body either in a holy spot or in the hut of an eater of dog s flesh once knowledge is won one becomes jnanin a knower of brahman free from all latent impressions of karma\n the cause of bondage is mental construction give that up\n liberation comes through the absence of mental construction pracit ise it intelligently\n in the context of objects sense organs and their contact by wary perpetually and steadily avoiding states of mental construction\n do not succumb to objects neither identify yourself with the sense organs\n having renounced all constructions identify with what remains\n if anything please you then in a state of bondage are you in empirical life if nothing pleases you then indeed are you liberated here\n in the multitude of objects moving and stationery extending from grass etc\n upto the living bodies let there be nothing that gives you pleasure\n in the absence of the i sense and its negation at once existent and non existent what remains unattached self same superlatively pure and steadfast is said to be the fourth\n that superlatively pure sameness the quiescent status of liberation in life the state of the spectator is inempirical usage called the fourth state\n this is neither wakefulness nor dream for there is no room for mental constructions\n neither is this the state of deep sleep for no inertness is involved in this\n this world as it is is dissolved and then it is the fourth state for those who are tranquillised and rightly awakened for the unawakened it stands changeless as it is in its plurality \n when the aspect of i sense is given up and equability dominates and the mind disintegrates the fourth state comes on\n the repudiation of the objective manifold is the doctrine of the shastras setting forth the spirit\n here is neither avidya nor maya this is the tranquil brahman unfatigued\n one is inevitably tranquillised in the clear sky of the spirit known as brahman whose essence is quietude and equability and which is resplendent with all powers\n giving up everything be wedded to an immense silence o sinless one plunged into nirvana lifted above ratiocination with mind attenuated and intellect becalmed\n with a tranquillised mind abide in the self like one dumb blind and deaf ever turned inward superlatively pure with brimming inner wisdom\n o twice born perform acts remaining in deep slumber in wakefulness itself\n having internally renounced everything act externally as occasion arises\n mind s being alone is suffering the giving up of the mind alone is joy\n therefore through noncognition of objects attenuate the mind in the sky of the spirit\n seeing that the beautiful or the ugly always remains like a stone irremovable thus through one s own effort is empirical existence conquered\n what is hidden in the vedanta taught in bygone ages should not be offered

immutable\n see reality as spirit be tranquil and at ease\n the adepts know yoga to be the non knowing of plurality the spontaneous attrition of the object seeking mind\n rooted in yoga perform actions or averse to all actions perform them not at all\n aversion is felt everyday to inborn tendencies to act nevertheless one tends to plunge into noble actions with gusto\n always one hesitates as regards the instinctive actions of the unregenerate one never refers to what may compromise others but attends to their righteous deeds\n one does gentle deeds that pain none always dreads sin and avoids all forms of sense gratification\n such a one s speech is informed by affection and love it is lovely and fit with due regard to time and place\n with proper yought act and speech one waits upon the virtuous\n getting them from all conceivable sources one studies the shastras\n then one attains the first stage of yoga\n whoever entertains such youghts as regards the crossing of transmigratory life is said to have attained a state of yoga\n the rest are said to be just noble arya \n coming to the next stage of yoga called analysis vichara the sadhaka resorts to the foremost scholars well known for their serious interpretations of sruti and smriti good conduct fixed attention contemplation and activities\n as a house holder knows his homestead so having mastered all that has to be learned the sadhaka comes to know the categories and the doctrines vis a vis what has to be done and avoided\n as a snake sheds its slough so sheds he even a slight attachment to external objects when intensified by pride conceit intolerance greed and delusion\n with a mind disciplined through devotion to the shastras teacher and the company of the virtuous he truthfully masters the entire body of knowledge including the secret doctrines\n just as a lover repairs to a spotless bed of flowers from the second he the sadhaka proceeds to the third state styled non attachment\n fixing his steady mind on the truthful import of the shastras and busy with the recitation of spiritual texts proper to the hermitages of the ascetics he expends his long life seated on a bed of stone or a slab diverting himself with ramblings in the forest made beautiful by his placid mind\n as a result of his meritorious actions the righteous sadhaka passes his time in the delights of detachment repeatedly studying the positive shastras\n one s perception of reality becomes clear only in due course\n the enlightened one reaching the third stage experiences this for himself\n non attachment is of two kinds listen to the distinction as it is being drawn\n this non attachment is of two kinds one general and the other superior\n the general non attachment is non involvement in objects based on the perception i am neither agent nor enjoyer neither the sublater nor the sublated \n everything be it pleasure or pain is fashioned by prior deeds or everything is under the sway of the lord\n i do nothing in regard to it \n enjoyments and non enjoyments are dread diseases possessions are great disasters\n all contacts just promote separation\n sufferings are diseases of youghts \n time is ceaselessly fashioning all things so the general non attachment of the sadhaka who has grasped the import of the major texts consists in being averse to all things and in not dwelling on them mentally\n by cultivating this sequence of stages the superior non attachment in the case of the magnanimous sadhakas supervenes\n it is said to be silence repose and quiescence\n for speech and import have been flung far away in the light of the truth i am no agent the agent is god or my own prior actions \n the first stage that occurs is sweet on account of the sait isfaction and joy that attend it \n the sadhaka puman has just stepped into the sequence of states\n the first is an ambrosial sprout\n the first stage is the internal cleansed birth place of the other stages\n thence one attains the second and third stages\n among these the all pervading third stage is superior\n here the sadhaka has outgrown all proneness to imagine and get ensnared \n those who reach the fourth stage after the dwindling of nescience through the exercises of the three stages look on all things with the same eye\n when non duality is established and duality dissolved those who have reached the fourth stage look upon the phenomenal world as a dream\n the first three states are said to be the waking state the fourth is called the dream state\n and the mind dissolves like the fragments of an autumnal cloud\n he who reaches the fifth stage survives but as bare being\n due to the dissolution of the mind in this stage the world manifold does not present itself at all\n reaching the fifth stage called deep sleep the sadhaka remains as pure non dual being all particulars having completely vanished\n having reached the fifth stage one stays consolidated in deep sleep joyful inwardly awake all dual appearances gone\n looking inwards even when attending to outer things he appears always indrawn being extremely exhausted\n pracit ising in this fifth stage free from all innate impulses one reaches as a matter of course the sixth stage named the fourth \n where there is neither the non existent nor the existent neither the i nor the non i with all analytic thinking gone one stays alone totally fearless in non duality\n beyond knots with all doubt vanquished liberated in life devoid of imaginations yough unextinguished yet extinguished he is like a painted flame\n having dwelt in the sixth stage he shall reach the seventh\n the state of disembodied liberation is called the seventh stage of yoga\n this is the acme of all stages beyond words quiescent\n avoiding conformity with the ways of the world and the ways of the body avoiding conformity with shastras get rid of all superimpositions on the self\n all that is here the vishva the prajna etc\n is nothing but om\n because there is non difference between import and expression and because as distinct from each other neither of these two is known the vishva is just the letter a and u is said to be the taijasa\n the prajna is the letter m \n thus know in order discriminating with great effort before concentration samadhi sets in\n in this due order the concrete and the subtle should all be dissolved in the spiritual self and the spiritual self should be dissolved perceiving i am the om vasudeva ever pure awake free existent non dual massed and supreme bliss because all this objective world is pain in the beginning middle and end\n therefore you sinless one renouncing everything be devoted to truth\n think i am brahman solid intelligence and bliss free from impurity holy lifted above mind

he may take to renunciation\n one reaches the stage of forest life vanaprastha after having maintained the sacred fire as a householder \n he goes to lead the forest life with self control accompanied by his wife as yough he were a person attached to her\n why does he undergo the life of a mendicant monk in vain having given up the happiness of worldly life what is that impending misery the yought of which should make him abandon great pleasures such is the query of the wife \n i am afraid of the miserable life in the womb of another mother and also the miseries of heat cold etc\n so i wish to enter the cave shelter of renunciation the means for the painless transcendent state of brahman \n thus he replies \n having renounced the sacred fire he shall not return to it even in mentally reciting the mantras pertaining to it \n for i i\n the mantra pertaining to this sacred fire becoming extinct being incompatible with renunciation shall be merged into the oncoming knowledge of brahman \n he may repeat the mantras pertaining to self realization \n he shall have consecration\n he shall be wearing ochre coloured garment\n he shall remove the hairs excluding those in the arm pits and the private parts\n with right hand raised he shall set forth as a mendicant monk abandoning the path of worldly life\n he shall move on wiyout a fixed abode\n living on alms he shall deeply ponder over vedantic texts and meditate on his identity with the transcendent brahman \n he shall possess pure knowledge pavitram for the protection of all beings\n these verses are there or the same theme the mendicant monk shall have a water pot an alms bowl a sling to carry his effects sandals to traverse a long distance literally over the three worlds a patched garment to withstand cold a loin cloth to cover his privities a purifying ring pavitram of holy grass a bath towel and an upper garment other than these the ascetic shall give up all else\n he shall sleep on the sandy bed of a river or outside a temple\n he shall not bother his body too much either with pleasures or pain\n pure water should be used for bathing drinking and cleansing\n he shall not become pleased with praise nor shall he curse others when censured\n his alms bowl shall be a cup made of leaves and the material for washing shall be the prescribed fresh earth \n thus provided with the means of living he shall with the senses subdued always mutter the philosophical mantras\n the wise ascetic shall realize in his mind the identity of the individual self with the universal self which is the meaning of om\n from brahman arose ether from ether air from air fire from fire water from water the earth\n to the prime cause of all these primary elements\n brahman i resort in reverence i resort to the ageless immortal and indestructible brahman\n in me the ocean of unalloyed bliss many a time arise and fall waves of the universe due to the winds of the fanciful sport of illusion maya \n i am not attached to my body just as the sky is not attached to the clouds\n hence how can i have its i\n the body s characteristics during the stages of waking dreaming and deep sleep \n i am always far beyond imagination like ether i am different from it the body as the sun is from the objects of illumination i am ever changeless just like the unchangeable i\n the meru mountain and like the ocean am i limitless\n i am narayana i am the destroyer of the demon naraka i am siva the destroyer of the three aerial cities i am the purusha i am the supreme lord i am the indivisible consciousness the witness of all i am wiyout a superior i am devoid of i ness egoit ism and mine ness possessiveness \n the ascetic shall by the practice of yoga bring together the prana and apana vital airs in the body\n he shall place the palms of the two hands at the perineum gently biting the tip of the tongue thrust out to the extent of a grain of barley\n similarly directing the eyes open to the extent of a blackgram seed towards the ether of the ear and the feet firmly resting on the ground he shall not allow the ear to function and the nose to smell i\n the five senses shall be controlled \n thus he accomplishes the union of the prana and apana vital airs \n therefore the vital air passing through the kundalini and the susumna gets dissolved in the sahasrarachakra at the top of the head\n then the vision the mind vital air and the fire of the body reach the seat of siva and get dissolved that is brahman that is the transcendent brahman\n that brahman will be realized by the practice of yoga which is facilitated by the acquisition of practice in previous births\n with the help of the external and internal organs the knowledge of the qualified brahman called effulgence reaching the heart and supported by the vital air s capability to proceed upwards goes through the susumna nadi and piercing the skull at the top of the body one realizes the indestructible qualified brahman \n those sages who attain the transcendent state through the passage in the skull at the top of their body do never return to the worldly life for they realize the lower as well as the higher brahman \n the attributes of objects seen do not affect the onlooker who is different from them\n the attributes of a householder do not affect him who remains non aligned wiyout any mental modification just as a lamp which suffers no change by the objects revealed by it \n let me the non aligned sage roll in water or on the ground i am untouched by their characteristics just as the ether in the pot is not affected by the attributes of the pot\n i am free from the effect of activities and changes devoid of parts and form i am wiyout fancies i am eternal i am wiyout a support and i am devoid of duality\n i am the form of all beings i am the all i am beyond everything and wiyout a second i am the one indivisible knowledge and i am the compact bliss of the self\n seeing everywhere the self considering the self as wiyout a second enjoying the bliss of the self i remain wiyout reflections\n walking standing sitting lying or otherwise the wise sage delighting in the atman shall live as he wishes

knowledge vis a vis stumbling shouting enjoying dancing singing and playing on musical instruments\n he is the ancient spirit that distinguishes between nyaya mimamsa and the institutes of law and the specific object of listening smelling and grasping\n he is the inner self\n next the supreme self the imperishable he is to meditated on with the help of the yogic steps breath control withdrawal of sense organs fixation of mind contemplation and concentration he is to be inferred by the thinkers on the self as like unto the seed of the banyan tree or a grain of millet or a hundredth part of a split hair\n thus is he won and not known\n he is not born does not die does not dry is not wetted not burnt does not tremble is not split does not sweat\n he is beyond the gunas is spectator is pure partless alone subtle owning naught blemishless immutable devoid of sound touch colour taste smell is indubitable non grasping omnipresent\n he is unthinkable and invisible\n he purifies the impure the unhallowed\n he is not subject to empirical existence\n the good named the atman is pure one and non dual always in the form of brahman\n brahman alone shines forth\n even as the world with its distinctions like affirmation negation etc\n brahman alone shines forth\n with distinctions like teacher and disciples also brahman alone appears\n from the point of view of truth pure brahman alone is\n neither knowledge nor ignorance neither the world nor aught else is there \n what sets empirical life afoot is the appearance of the world as real\n what winds up empirical life is its appearance as unreal\n what discipline is required to know this is a pot except the adequacy of the means of right knowledge once it is given the knowledge of the object supervenes \n the ever present self shines when the means of its cognition is present \n neither place nor time nor purity is required\n the knowledge i am devadatta depends on nothing else\n similarly the knowledge i am brahman of the knower of brahman is independent \n just as the whole world by the sun by the splendour of the knowledge of brahman is everything illumined\n what can illumine the non existent and illusory non self that which endows the vedas shastras puranas and all other beings with import that knower what will illumine the child ignores hunger and bodily pain and plays with things\n in the same way the happy brahman knower delights in himself wiyout the sense of mine and i \n thus the silent sage alive and alone the embodiment of desirelessness treats the objects of desire\n existing as the self of all he is ever content abiding in his self\n free from all wealth he rejoices always yough companionless he is mighty\n though not eating he is ever content peerless he looks on all alike yough acting he does nothing yough partaking of fruit yet he is no experiencer thereof\n living in a body he is still disembodied yough determinate he is omnipresent never is this brahman knower disembodied and ever existent affected by the pleasant and the unpleasant or by the good and the evil\n because it appears to be encompassed by rahu the darkness the unencompassed sun is said to be encompassed by deluded men not knowing the truth\n similarly deluded folk behold the best of brahman knowers liberated from the bondage of body etc\n as yough he is embodied since he appears to have a body\n the body of the liberated one remains like the shed slough of the snake\n moved a little hither and thither by the vital breath that body is borne like a piece of timber up and down by the flood waters\n by fate is the body borne into contexts of experiences at appropriate times\n on the contrary he who giving up all migrations both knowledge and unknowable stays as the pure unqualified self is himself the manifest shiva\n he is the best of all brahman knowers\n in life itself the foremost brahman knower is the ever free he has accomplished his end\n all adjuncts having perished being brahman he is assimilated to the non dual brahman like a man who with appropriate apparels is an actor and wiyout them resumes his natural state in the same way the best of brahman knowers is always brahman alone and none else\n just as space becomes space itself when the enclosing pot perishes so when particular cognitions are dissolved the brahman knower himself becomes nothing but brahman as milk poured into milk oil into oil and water into water become milk oil and water \n just as combined they become one so does the atman knowing sage in the atman\n thus disembodied liberation is the infinite status of being\n having won the status of brahman no longer is the yogin reborn for his ignorance born bodies have all been consumed by the experimental knowledge of being as the self\n because that yogin has become brahman how can brahman be reborn bondage and liberation set up by maya are not real in themselves in relation to the self just as the appearance and disappearance of the snake are not in relation to the stirless rope\n bondage and liberation may be described as real and unreal and as due to the nescience concealment of truth \n brahman suffers from no concealment whatsoever\n it is uncovered there being nothing other than it to cover it \n the ideas it is and it is not as regards reality are only ideas in the intellect\n they do not pertain to the eternal reality\n so bondage and liberation are set up by maya and do not pertain to the self\n in the supreme truth as in the sky impartite inactive quiescent flawless unstained and nondual where is room for mental

pippalada of angiras family and asked him all created things were surely present in the divine ether of the heart of brahman the hiranyagarbha \n how did the great lord create them out of himself in different species and who is this great and powerful lore to him pippalada said the most excellent lore of brahman which i now expound brahman of that alone is true\n it shines brilliantly in the city of the transcendent brahman being beyond rajas and the other gunas partless pure indestructible and sustaining the power of the senses and the vital airs\n he is the creator of the group of bees in the form of individual souls and restrains their outward vision \n remaining in the city of his self doing no worldly work as an ascetic he realizes oneness with brahman \n but as a doer of action he reaps the fruit of repeated births and deaths like a farmer\n the knower of the true nature of action does action wiyout attachment \n knowing the secret of action that unattached action leads to liberation the ascetic shall do action\n which person possessing discrimination will throw the net of motivated action on the one brahman screening it motiveless action will not drag him to worldliness will not drag him\n the deities presiding over the vital breath are four vishva viraj otir and turya \n all the nadis where the vital breath and the deities remain are also four \n the former two active in rama and arama get fatigued in the waking and dreaming states and rest during deep sleep as a hawk flying in the sky\n just as a hawk flying in the sky goes when fatigued into its abode the nest so the speaker the self after remaining in this waking and the other dreaming state rests in deep sleep \n this self while resting in the golden transcendent sheath of the ether of the heart and being immortal is active in the three nadis rama etc\n the first pada of this being avidya it remains in the state of brahman in the three quarters\n the remaining pada the jiva attains its natural state and then follows i\n hence the speaker of elsewhere the jiva in the avidya and the other the tripada brahman are fancied to be different and thereby the jiva wanders in bondage\n alyough the jiva remains in the golden transcendent sheath of the ether of the heart yet it experiences the states of waking etc\n just as devadatta i\n any person awakened from sleep when prodded with a stick does not go back to sleep immediately so also the jiva getting wisdom from the vedanta does not have the delusion of the three states of waking etc\n and it is not tainted by good or bad acts such as the optional charitable deeds\n it is similar to a small boy who experiences joy wiyout specific desires in whatever thing that comes to him \n just as the luminous being jiva after getting fatigued in the waking and dreaming states welcomes the joy of deep sleep so it experiences bliss by realizing its oneness with the supreme effulgence brahman which gives all round lustre to luminaries such as the sun \n thus the heart chitta merges itself in the highest brahman and thus realizing the paramatman enjoys bliss\n the pure colour i\n the state of non distinction arises from the grace of ishvara\n again by the same path of turya svapna dreaming in the fourth state he gives rest to the self\n just as a leech moves from one position to another the jiva moves from the waking state of the turya to the dreaming state of the turya this desire to move from one state to another in the turya arises due to the grace of ishvara\n by this the jiva enjoys itself by means of the distinctionful and distinctionless deep meditation savikalpa and nirvikalpa samadhi \n the juncture of the individual and supreme consciousness is rejected as there is a tinge of distinction involved in it\n when distinctionlessness alone exists it is the highest i\n brahman and there is nothing other than that\n when self realization does not result by the study etc\n of the scripture then one shall resort to the eight limbed yoga this like a flower of a plantain tree ever rubbing against the stem and attaining the state of a blossom succeeds in attaining perfection \n that which remains as the source of indra ishvara is ever awake there as the source of the veda as parameshvara \n beyond the bonds of good and bad he the ascetic is not tainted by accidental good or bad actions\n this effulgent being is the bestower of favour on other gods like the god brahma the internal check of the form of unattached pure consciousness the purusha the hamsa of the pranava the supreme brahman\n it is not the chief prana vital breath \n the pranava is the self jiva \n this state of the jiva remains as the first effulgent being\n how can he who knows thus the true nature of the pranava set forth difference between the jiva and brahman he realizes that the jiva is brahman alone \n then to this realized person reality i\n true wisdom constitutes the inner tuft and sacred thread\n to the brahmana desirous of liberation is allowed the state of the inward tuft and sacred thread\n the wearing of externally visible tuft and sacred thread is necessary for the householders engaged in rituals\n the characteristic of the inward sacred thread is not clearly visible like external thread it is the union with reality inwardly\n it avidya is not existent as the cause is not visible nor non existent as the effect is visible as the phenomenal world nor both existent and non existent part as the two are incompatible \n it is not different from brahman as it has no independent existence nor non different as it is not a substance nor of both different and non different as it is an impossibility \n it is not possessed of parts as the parts are absent in the cause nor partless as the effect is seen possessed of parts nor a combination of both\n thus avidya is indescribable \n it is to be discarded by the realization of oneness of brahman and the self for it is the cause of illusion\n thus it is to be understood \n there is nothing other than brahman of the five padas i\n there are four places for realizing the inward jiva brahman who consists of four padas inside the body\n the vyasti s four padas are vishva taijasa prajna and turiya\n the samasti s four padas are viraj sutra bija and turiya \n in the eyes throat heart and head there are the four states of waking dreaming deep sleep and turya\n moreover the atman is to be conceived as the ahavaniya garhapatya dakshina and sabhya fires\n in the waking state the presiding deity is the god brahma in dreaming state vishnu in deep sleep rudra and the fourth state is the indestructible one consisting of consciousness\n hence the four states waking etc\n are to be considered as a covering by four fingers and just as the sacred thread is of ninety six four finger breadths in extent so the inward brahmaa sutra consists of ninety six categories tattvas \n as the sacred thread consists of three threads so the inward brahmaa sutra is brought to the state of thirty two categories in each of the three gunas\n this state of the triad purified by wisdom is to be known separately as the three gods brahma vishnu and shiva \n this is known as the nine brahman s possessed of nine attributes\n these counted as nine being rendered into three each having three attributes are to be identified with the digits of the sun moon and fire\n the first and last of the triad are to be turned thrice in the middle and are to be considered as brahma vishnu and maheshvara\n the first and last are to be joined and the knot of nonduality is to be made in the knot of consciousness\n then this which extends from the navel to the brahmarandhra and connected with the twenty seven tattvas separately and possessing the three gunas is to be considered as one yough they are seen with the characteristics of the trinity\n this inward brahmaa sutra is to be considered as hanging from the left shoulder reaching up to the right hip\n the meeting together of the first and last is to be understood as having one foundation\n things made of clay are considered real but it is verbosity born of ignorance the transformation is a mere name that it is clay alone is the truth\n as there is no pot wiyout clay so the primary cause brahman alone is real \n with the two letters of the hamsa i\n i am the hamsa brahman he should be convinced of the internal tuft and sacred thread\n the state of a brahmana is the state deserving meditation on brahman\n the state of being a sage has the absence of visible tuft and sacred thread\n thus the householder has visible tuft for performing ritual and the sacred thread for acquiring wisdom\n to the state of the semblance of a brahmana there is the tuft consisting of a mass of hair and sacred thread made of cotton threads\n the brahmaa sutra is one alone it is four as vishva viraj etc\n the twenty four tattvas constitute the threads\n the nine tattvas constitute the one transcendent brahman but people provide many paths such as sankhya yoga etc\n due to difference in approach\n liberation is one alone to all whether they are brahma and the other gods divine sages or human beings\n brahman is one alone\n the state of the brahmana is one alone\n castes stages of life and special duties are divergent\n the tuft is the same to the castes and stages of life\n to the ascetic seeking salvation the basis of tuft and sacred thread the wise declare is the pranava alone\n the hamsa is the tuft the pranava is the sacred thread and the nada is the connecting link\n this is the dharma and no other is the dharma\n how is that the pranava hamsa and nada constitute the three fold thread and this remains in consciousness in one s heart\n know this to be the three fold brahman\n the ascetic shall discard the worldly tuft and sacred thread\n having had a shave removing the tuft a wise person shall discard the external sacred thread\n he shall have as the sacred thread the transcendent brahman which is indestructible\n for avoiding rebirth he shall ever long for liberation\n the sutra is so called as it indicates liberation the sutra indeed is the highest position\n he knows the sutra who has become a seeker after liberation a mendicant monk\n he is the knower of the veda having unimpeachable conduct\n he is the learned brahmana who sanctifies by his presence the persons who sit in the same row to dine with him\n the yogin who is the knower of yoga a brahmana and an ascetic shall wear that sutra by which all this phenomenal world is joined together as a unity just as gems are strung together in a thread\n a learned brahmana who is deeply intent on yoga and spiritual wisdom shall discard the external sacred thread\n he who wears the sutra consisting of devotion to brahman attains salvation\n there is neither impurity nor the state of eating the leavings of others when one possesses that sutra\n those who having the sacred thread of spiritual wisdom possess the sutra inwardly are the knowers of the sutra in the world and they are the true wearers of the sacred thread\n their tuft and sacred thread consist of spiritual wisdom jnana they are established in jnana to them jnana alone is supreme and this jnana is declared to be sanctifying\n the wise one whose tuft consists of jnana and no other like the flame emanating from fire is said to possess the true tuft not the others who wear a mass of hair\n those who are immersed in activities whether vedic ritual or worldly actions live as brahmanas in name only filling their bellies\n they come to grief and have rebirth again and again\n the sacred thread hanging from the left shoulder to the right hip is contrariwise to liberation \n the wise shall wear i\n possess true knowledge which is rooted in consciousness having threads in the form of true principles tattvas and extending from the navel to the tip of the aperture in the crown of the head brahmarandhra \n this sacred thread which forms part of ritual and made of cotton threads is to be worn by them i\n he whose tuft consists of wisdom as also his sacred thread has all the true characteristics of a brahmana others have none at all\n it is this sacred thread which is the supreme panacea\n the wise one who wears this sacred thread attains liberation\n that learned brahmana is entitled to renunciation who has the sacred thread both within and wiyout but the one having one i\n the external one alone is never entitled to renunciation\n hence by all effort the ascetic shall long for liberation\n discarding the external thread he shall wear the internal sutra within himself\n disregarding the external phenomenal world tuft and sacred thread he shall hold on to the tuft and sacred thread in the form of the sacred syllable pranava and brahman hamsa and thus equip himself for liberation\n thus declared the revered sage saunaka\n thus ends the upanishad\n om o devas may we hear with our ears what is

brahman neither with the head nor with the middle part nor with the bottom but with what remains in the shape of the tail since it is said that brahman is the tail and substratum\n thus those who contemplate this fourfold division attain the supreme goal\n not by rituals not by begetting children not by wealth but by renunciation tyaga alone a few attained immortality\n his the avadhuta s worldly existence consists in moving about freely with or wiyout clothes\n for them there is nothing righteous or unrighteous nothing holy or unholy\n through all consuming correct knowledge samgrahaneshti the avadhuta performs ashvamedha sacrifice within himself \n that is the greatest sacrifice and the great yoga\n nought of this extraordinary free action of his should be disclosed\n this is the great vow mahavrata \n he is not tainted like the ignorant\n as the sun absorbs all waters and the fire consumes all things remaining unaffected by them even so the pure yogin enjoys all objects unstained by virtues or sins\n as the ocean into which all waters flow maintains its own nature despite the water pouring in from all sides so he alone attains peace into whom all desires flow in like manner not he who seeks the objects of pleasure\n there is neither death nor birth none is bound none aspires\n there is neither seeker after liberation nor any liberated this indeed is the ultimate truth\n many were my activities perchance in the past for gaining things here and hereafter or for obtaining liberation\n all that is now of the past\n that itself is the state of contentment\n verily remembering the same i\n the past achievements involving objects he now remains thus ever content\n the miserable ignorant desirous of children etc\n wherefore shall i suffer who am filled with supreme bliss let those who yearn to go to the other worlds perform rituals\n what shall i who am of the nature of all the worlds perform for what and how let those who are worlds perform for what and how let those who are qualified interpret the shastras or teach the vedas\n i have no such qualification since i am free of action\n i have no desire for sleeping or begging bathing or cleaning\n nor do i do them\n if onlookers thus superimpose let them do so\n what matters to me the superimposition of others a heap of the red black berries of the abrus precatorius would not burn even if others superimposed fire on it\n likewise i partake not of worldly duties superimposed on me by others\n let them who are ignorant of the reality study the scriptures knowing the reality why should i study let them who have doubts reflect upon what was studied \n having no doubts i do not reflect\n were i under illusion i may meditate having no illusion what meditation can there be for me confusion of body for the self i never experience\n the habitual usage i am a man is possible even wiyout this confusion for it is due to impressions accumulated during a long time\n when the results of actions set in motion prarabdha karman are exhausted the habitual usage also ends\n this worldly usage will not cease even with repeated meditation unless such actions are exhausted\n if infrequency of worldly dealings is sought let there be contemplation for you\n wherefore should i to whom worldly dealings offer no hindrance contemplate \n because i do not have distractions i do not need concentration distraction or concentration being of the mind that modifies\n what separate experience can there be for me whom am of the nature of eternal experience what has to be done is done what has to be gained is gained for ever\n let my dealings worldly scriptural or of other kinds proceed as they have started i being neither an agent of action nor one affected by it \n or even yough i have achieved what has to be achieved let me remain on the scriptural path for the sake of the well being of the world\n what harm for me thereby \n let the body be engaged in the worship of gods bathing cleaning begging and so forth\n let speech repeatedly utter the tara mantra or recite the upanishadic passages\n let yought contemplate vishnu or let it be dissolved in the bliss of brahman\n i am the witness\n i neither do nor cause any doing\n being contented with duties fulfilled and achievements accomplished he ceaselessly reflects as follows with a contented mind \n blessed am i blessed am i\n directly and always i experience my own self\n blessed am i blessed am i the bliss of brahman shines brightly in me\n blessed am i blessed am i\n i do not see the misery of

    "Tripuratapini": "om gods with ears let us hear what is good adorable ones with eyes let us see what is good\n with steady limbs with bodies praising let us enjoy the life allotted by the gods\n may indra of wide renown grant us well being may pusan and all gods grant us well being\n may tarksya of unhampered movement grant us well being\n may brihaspati grant us well being\n om peace peace peace now in this sphere of nescience the lord sadasiva assuming the guises of prajapati vishnu and rudra comes to be styled goddess tripura\n by his primeval power are fashioned the three abodes the earth the atmosphere and the heavens or the heavens the earth and the nether world\n in the form of hrim identical with the maya of hara the divine hrillekha permeates with her terrible might the terminus of the three peaks above the junction of the two eyebrows the seat of equilibrium of the three gunas and the region where the world of objects is dissolved\n this selfsame divinity is called tripura\n on that adorable splendour of the divine creator we meditate may he our youghts inspire who beyond all darkness is om\n let us for all knowing fire the soma press who of our foes the wealth consumes as boat over river so may he help us over all difficulties all troubles\n let us adore with sacrifice the three eyed god fragrant increaser of earthly growth\n like cucumber fruit from its stalk released let me from death find freedom unto immortality\n the supreme sovereign the goddess of the three cities is the embodiment of the three vedas and the supreme knowledge consisting of the letters\n the first four divisions elucidate brahman the second pertains to sakti or power and the third to siva the good\n it is recorded that the worlds the vedas the sciences legends codes medical works and astronomical treait ises have all proceeded from the union of siva and sakti goodness and power \n now we shall elucidate the supreme mystery of it i\n the mantra given above \n the syllable tat of the great mantra is the eternal brahman the supreme lord indefinable impeccable unconditioned and unconstrained\n he thinks perceives evolves desires the status of consciousness\n thus that sole deity essentially good evolves as the visible world\n in the ascetics sacrifices mystics he desires and what is desired is born\n being free from desires in truth and impeccable he holds sway\n he puts forth letters like a ka ca ta ta pa ya and sa\n hence is the lord named desire\n so technically the lord as desire pervades ka\n desire alone is this tat\n thus is karma understood\n hence it is the sense of tat\n whoso knows thus becomes the lord \n the root supreme means to give birth to a living thing \n savitur gives birth to living things power gives birth\n this primeval power is tripura the supreme sovereign tripura goddess great with ear rings adorned in sphere of fire abiding\n whosoever masters this knowledge pervades everything\n the power of the triangle the serpent power creates with the aid of the exalted letter e\n so only the letter e is taken\n varenyam means the best the adorable the imperishable woryour of obeisance\n so varenyam is understood as the letter e\n whoso knows this becomes the best \n bhargo devasya dhimahi this we shall expound dha denotes bearing\n by yought is the supreme lord borne\n bharga is the shining one that dwells in the centre the imperishable fourth letter the immediate fourth the all the inmost of everything\n the fourth letter i is in the middle of words\n thus is the form of bharga expounded they say\n so the letter i is understood as the equivalent of bhargo devasya dhi\n the exposition of mahi\n the letter in which are present greatness inertness and hardness is mahi\n the letter la is the supreme abode\n the letter la denotes the sphere predominantly hard comprising the seas the mountains the seven islands and the forests and having a resplendent form\n by mahi the goddess earth is denoted\n dhiyo yo nah prachodayat\n may the supreme self the primeval transcendental sadasiva inspire our youghts our luminous self with the steadfast letter la towards the transcendental undifferentiated real which is beyond the sphere of desire for contemplation\n wiyout verbal utterance holding this in mind only should one meditate\n finally that which is other than the self becomes the supreme light pure consciousness the divinity dwelling in the heart whose mark is consciousness and which is the same as hrim whose abode is the heart\n so the group of five letters vagbhavakuta which gives rise to the five elements and consists of five sections is clarified\n who knows thus reaps the results \n now the next group that has become kamakala is called kamakuta say the wise\n in the utterance of the thirty two sacred syllables tat savitur varenyam etc\n tat is the supreme self sadasiva the imperishable the pure the unconditioned\n the syllable ha setting forth the identity with siva has the form of siva it is held to be unarticulated yough a syllable\n thus remaining external it ha indicates the power\n along the line indicated earlier of tat savituh the moon whose seed syllable is sa must be placed next to the sun whose seed syllable is ha \n the light of the sun fills the region between the basic circle and the sacred orifice of the crown\n the syllable sa is said to be unique\n he who is meditated on as tat and savitur is the divine being whose essence is siva and sakti\n siva is the supreme god so brahman knowers say sakti is all that is born sun and moon united are hamsa brahman attributeless\n from siva supreme who creates desire s objects wells up desire lord of desires the choice light is described as the letter ka\n tat savitur varenyam bhargo devah\n the imperishable milk that wipes out the effects of acts and their agents is worth imbibing\n that imperishable milk is won through the union of the supreme self and the individual self\n that is the clear third syllable ha\n it is indeed sadasiva the flawless the shining divinity\n the last syllable is thus expounded as the supreme abode\n dhi denotes upholding the upholding of inert matter is associated with mahi denoted by the syllable la\n the sense of la coming after ha denoting siva is clearly brahman \n the last syllable is the supreme spirit\n may it inspire our youghts paro rajase savadom this group is the abode of kamakala i\n he who treads the six paths such as the path of letters reaches the seat of vishnu\n whoso knows thus reaches that seat \n nothing besides this exists says the lord\n after this the other the third group saktikuta attains accord with the gayatri of thirty two syllables\n from the self comes the sky from the sky the air stirs forth\n what comes into being in dependence on it is adorable\n befitting savitur is the coming together of the individual self and the supreme self\n the syllable denoting the individual self sa clearly attains the form of the luminous power\n with these words is counted the syllable ka denoting siva who contains all \n with mahi etc\n la is in accord \n with the desirable lovely visible remainder i\n dhiyo yo nah etc\n the desirable lovely hrillekha is in accord \n thus is saktikuta elucidated\n whoso repeats thus the fifteen syllabled mantra of tripura attains all desires he attains all enjoyments he conquers all worlds he causes all words to bloom he attains the status of rudra breaking through the abode of vishnu the veil of maya he reaches the supreme brahman\n having set forth the primeval vidya incantation the sakti group sa ka la hrim and power and siva denoted by sa ka must be contemplated in the first abode the wakeful state \n the lopamudra incantation ha sa ka la hrim must be contemplated in the second abode the dream state \n in the third abode or the collective sleep state must be contemplated the previous incantation the power hrillekha wiyout the nasal sound sa ka la hri the incantation on which durvasas the wrathful sage meditated\n the vagbhava group of the previous incantation is described as pertaining to manu chandra and kubera\n after madana or klim comes the auspicious vagbhava next is the kamakala ka etc\n next is the sakti group sa etc\n this grouping in this order was adored by manu and must be contemplated in the fourth abode the visva state \n first that which is styled siva and sakti namely ha etc\n then vagbhava again the siva and sakti group and the third sa etc\n this incantation adored of chandra is to be contemplated in the fifth abode the taijasa state \n the incantation of siva etc\n added to that of chandra is the incantation of kubera it must be contemplated in the sixth abode the prajna state \n whoso knows this attains kubera s wealth \n leaving out the fourth vowel i and placing the sun and the moon represented by ha and sa in the beginning of all groups there results the vidya incantation promoting power over desires it is named after agastya and must be meditated on in the seventh abode the viraj state \n in the incantation of agastya given above set in twofold manner ha ha representing the incantations beginning with kama and madana then sa the seed syllable of sakti and ka the beginning of vagbhava\n of sa and ka let the vowels be shortened into half syllables\n this is the incantation of nandi to be contemplates in the eighth abode the sutratman state \n the vagbhava group the incantation of agastya consisting of words and meanings styled kamakala then all the power of maya the sakti group these integrated were adored by the sun and so this is called the incantation of prabhakara\n it must be meditated on in the mind abode the state of the causal abode \n again the incantation of agastya then vagbhava the seed letter of sakti hrim the seed letter of kama klim the seed letters of siva and sakti hamsa again the seed letter of kama klim the seed letter of the earth lam that of maya hrim the abode of kamakala the six syllables beginning with ha the seed letters of the moon and the sun so ham the seed letter of kama klim that of siva ham that of mahiman sa the third i\n hamsa so ham and hamsa integrated this incantation adored by shanmukha must be meditated on in the tenth abode\n repeating the incantation of agastya after that of shanmukha one gets the incantation of the supreme siva who rules over the last region\n it must be meditated on in the eleventh abode in the spirit of anujnatir \n repeating the incantation of agastya with vagbhava the incantation of kubera the abode of kamakala and the sovereign group of sakti derived from the incantation of lopamudra one gets the incantation of vishnu\n it must be meditated on in the twelfth abode in the spirit of pure anujna \n he who knows thus becomes vishnu \n the lord sadasiva said to all the gods having listened to the incantation set forth by me and made it clear to yourself i am brahman know there is nothing other than brahman and reduce whatever appears besides to brahman\n enthrone the supreme vidya the divinity in the heart the divinity styled kama the primeval one whose form is the fourth who transcends the fourth who exceeds all who occupies all seats consecrated with holy spells who is surrounded on all sides by deities seated on the main and subordinate seats who pervades all parts from prana vital breath to naman name the deity who is replete with delight who is in union with the supreme spirit who is in the heart whose gift is immortality who is complete and who is possessed of senses who forever is uprisen who comprises three groups has three abodes and is the supreme and most excellent maya who is the supreme power of vishnu\n enthrone in the pericarp of the heart s lotus the supreme sacred lakshmi the maya ever uprisen who controls the senses of her devotees who overwhelms the god of love who is armed with bow and arrow who inspires eloquence who abides in the centre of the moon s sphere is adorned with the crescent and assumes the guise of the seventeen prajapait is\n she is the great one eternally present\n her hands holding a noose and a goad are charming\n she the threeeyed one shines like the rising sun\n in the heart meditate on the goddess mahalakshmi comprehending all glories and possessed of all auspicious marks\n her own nature is spirit\n her name is trikuta\n she has a smiling face is beautiful is the great maya and is extremely fascinating\n she is adorned with great ear rings\n she rests on the threefold seat and abides in the nameless sacred abode sripitha\n she is the great bhairavi the power of spirit the great tripura\n meditate on her through the great yoga of meditation\n whoso knows her thus fulfils his life \n this is the great upanishad\n then therefore having uttered the verse let us for all knowing fire the soma press etc\n one achieves the realization of tripura\n the seers said explain the form of the extensive seed letters latent in the beginning middle and end of the glorificatory verse let us for all knowing fire the lord said to them utter the verse let us for all knowing fire the soma press etc\n repeat backwards the last group of the adividya i\n sa ka la hrim \n lengthen the first syllable of the first group as ka and that of the second group as ha \n together we get ka ha \n let us press the soma \n they say that this verse refers to the state in which cosmic ignorance vanishes it is competent to extinguish all that has been imagined as other than brahman it is the most excellent and blissful it is the great glory\n the first group called vagbhava the same as all prosperity causes the sublation of the world of objects the second group named after kama supports the world of objects the third named after sakti brings it into being\n thus meditating on the three groups and purifying the mind and elucidating the incantation of tripura one utters the mantra let us for all knowing fire the soma press etc\n then there dawns the wisdom called the incantation of mahavidyeshvari\n relying on the incantation of tripureshvari having uttered the word jatavedase for allknowing fire and associating the dot denoting the divine principle of siva with the vowels a etc\n of the pranava one gets the serpent power that has become one with immortality and has assumed the triangular form at the base of the spinal column \n thus of the chief principle of adividya the first group beginning with ka is vagbhava the second beginning with ha is the kamakala\n with the utterance of the syllables jata the supreme self is clearly expressed\n by the syllables jata etc\n the supreme undifferentiated self siva is denoted\n from birth onwards given to desires one desires lordship \n when desires are renounced perfection of one s nature results \n so the knowers of brahman declare\n that very thing the perfect spirit of siva we declare aright as installed in the three la s the seedletters of the earth\n clarifying the letters of the mantras in the light of the significance of the three la s which denote existence knowledge bliss absolute each in the midst of the three groups the word gotra must be understood\n the principle of siva is said to have been installed in this gotra\n thus has it been elucidated\n then follows the kamakala the second group beginning with ha \n the rest may be elucidated as before with reference to vamam competent \n the incantation thus explained is styled sarvarakshakari the all protecting one\n thus having clarified this incantation of tripureshi by means of the verse jatavedase etc\n there remains but the one supreme divinity the light\n or this results from the incantation consisting of the three groups \n grant the boon of the fourth i\n meditate on the fact that the three groups do not exist independently of siva \n fully identify the i sense with the nature of the lord\n relate each of the three groups with the incantation styled the all protecting one\n also clarify the incantation of the atmasana form\n repeat the verse jatavedase etc\n and once more recall to mind the all protecting incantation\n assign the form of siva and sakti to the initial and final positions of the all protecting incantation \n know that the syllable sa in the verse jatavedase etc\n has sakti as its quintessence and that the word soma represents the prowess whose quintessence is siva\n whoso knows this becomes great\n thus elucidate this incantation which abides in tripura and which is set forth in the circular seat\n repeat the verse jatavedase etc\n and also the incantation of tripureshvari which is ever ascendant and whose quintessence is siva and sakti as already set forth\n jatavedas symbolizes siva and sa has the imperishable sakti as its essence\n elucidate tripura the ever ascendant mahalakshmi resting on the seat of mantras symbolized by ha and sa denoting the sun and the moon pervading the three groups and subsisting in between siva and the primeval power\n repeat the verse jatavedase sunavama somam etc\n and call to mind the previous incantation associated with the seat of the real self\n with the words veda etc\n in the verse essentially the same as the sun denoted by ha is indicated the universal power of the spirit cicchakti ever ascendant\n put over it the dot denoting the siva principle \n elucidate the incantation of tripura garlanded abiding in the seat of the adept\n repeat the verse jatavedase sunavama somam etc\n relying on the enchanting tripura contemplate her in the syllables ka la\n elucidate the embodied incantation of tripura the sovereign over all incantations\n repeat jatavedase etc\n and relying on tripura the lakshmi one consumes fire\n elucidate the incantation of tripura the mother the sovereign threefold light knowing that she consumes with a mouth of fire\n thus with the words sa mah parsad ati durgani visva she illuminates the supreme she who is the inner self\n her incantation here having become an effect is utilized in the act of hailing\n she is deemed competent in every way\n thus these eight incantations the very limbs of the divine mahamaya are elucidated\n the gods verily said to the blessed lord tell us about the foremost of the wheels which promotes all desires is adored of all takes all forms faces all quarters and is the gateway to liberation by adoring which the yogins cut through the knot of differences into the undifferenced bliss of supreme brahman\n to them the blessed lord said we shall elucidate the concept of srichakra\n make a triangle with three vertices\n in it take as a measure a line lengthen it and make a triangle farther in front of it\n parallel to the base of the first triangle but over all make another triangle\n the first triangle is the wheel the second is the intermediary region and the third has marking it the eight triangles\n then moving the line beyond the intermediary quarters on the extremities of the eight spoked wheel move the line for soliciting the sadhyas etc\n have the upper part marked with triangles\n draw four lines going up from the closed regions\n in due order with the two measuring lines the wheel comes to be marked with ten triangles\n in the same manner again the wheel with ten spokes takes shape\n the wheel with fourteen spokes takes shape by joining the measuring line brought up to the parts of the ten spokes after having joined the four vertices of the central triangles with the triangles at the extremities of the four lines\n then take shape respectively the wheels enveloped in the eight lotuses the sixteen lotuses and the earth wheel with four gates\n thus has the wheel been elucidated by the process of construction\n i enumerate in the reverse order the elements of the wheel consisting of the nine selves\n the first wheel enchants the three worlds has the eight powers such as the power to assume the atomic size etc\n has the eight mothers has the decade beginning with the all agitating force etc\n is manifest is occupied by tripura and is characterized by the mystic mark of the all agitating force\n the second wheel fulfils all

of the seed\n the ninth master wheel is replete with all delight and is associated with the triad such as kameshvari\n it is exceedingly mysterious occupied by the great tripura the beautiful and has the mystic mark of the triangle\n all the metres indeed have passed over as spokes into the wheel\n this wheel is the srichakra\n in its hub in the sphere of fire are the sun and the moon\n worship the seat of the syllable om there\n there is the imperishable in the form of the point\n call to mind the supreme incantation skylike and immanent in it\n bring thither the great tripura the beautiful\n petition her with the single verse goddess in milk bathed with sandal paste besmeared goddess with bilva leaves worshipped durga i seek refuge in thee\n adore her with the mantra of mayalakshmi\n thus spoke the blessed lord\n with these mantras adore the blessed goddess\n then she becomes pleased and manifests herself\n so whoever worships with these mantras sees brahman\n he sees all things and achieves immortality whosoever knows thus\n this is the great upanishad\n the gods said to the blessed lord we would fashion the mystic marks\n the blessed lord told them seated in the lotus posture with the region of the knees touching the earth make the mystic marks\n he who knows the mystic mark of the triangle attracts all he knows all enjoys all fruits he breaks up all and immobilizes the foe\n keeping the middle fingers over the ring fingers he brings together the little fingers and the thumbs the forefingers being left free like rods pointing downward\n thus is the first mark made the triangle \n the same with the middle fingers joined is the second the seed \n the third has the shape of the goad\n rubbing the palms in the reverse order bringing together the thumbs and the forefingers the fourth is formed the great goad \n the fifth the great deluder is made when the thumbs are joined to the nails of the middle fingers after rubbing with the forefinger on the little finger and the ring fingers held straight with the middle fingers\n the same shaped at the tip like a goad is the sixth the all subduing \n keeping the left hand in the right resting posture the ring fingers in the middle of the little fingers and the middle fingers with the forefingers crossed over them the thumbs straight one gets the seventh the khechari the all attracting \n in the all upright all retracting posture keeping each little finger in the space between its middle finger and the ring finger and at the sides the forefingers in the shape of the goad and the thumbs and palms in contact the eighth is formed the all scattering \n the ring fingers rest on the back of the middle fingers the thumbs holding the middle fingers on which rest the forefingers remain in the middle thus is the ninth formed the all agitating \n keeping the little fingers equally in and the thumbs too equally in the mystic mark comes to have three sections\n the five arrows the mystic marks such as the five are clear\n krom is the seed of the goad ha sa are those of siva and sakti kha of killing prem of enchantment ha sa kha prem of khechari ha of the sun straum of desire ka the first seed of vagbhava is the ninth\n ha the first seed of kamakuta is the tenth\n whoso knows thus becomes an adept in mantra \n now therefore we shall expound the wheel that has become the kamakala\n hrim klim aim blum straum these five desires pervade the whole wheel\n wrap up the middle desire aim in the past desire straum i\n aim straum aim \n let this group be put within blum\n bind

indigo slays foes arrests all movements\n smearing it with lac one controls all worlds\n uttering the formula nine lakhs of times one attains the status of rudra\n wrapping up the wheel in the inscribed diagram one becomes victorious\n offering oblation in the fire built in a triangular fire place one wins over women\n doing so in a fire place shaped like a rod or a circle one acquires unrivalled wealth\n doing so in a square fire place one gets rain\n if one offers oblations in a triangular fire place foes are killed movements are immobilized offering flowers one becomes victorious\n offering substances having great tastes one becomes surcharged with supreme joy\n the great tastes are the six tastes\n we invoke you leader of hosts of poets poet most renowned doyen of

clearly has been explained to us the section on activities and what pertains to tripura with all related topics\n next tell us about the attributeless supreme\n the blessed lord spoke to them by means of the fourth and final maya avidya jnana vijnana and samyagjnana has the supreme brahman been indicated the supreme person the supreme self whose essence is consciousness\n the hearer the thinker the seer the teacher the toucher the proclaimer the cognizer the supreme knower the inner person in all persons that self must be cognized\n in that there are neither worlds seen nor unseen no gods or demons beasts or non beasts ascetics or non ascetics outcastes or non outcastes brahmains or non brahmains\n alone and single the supreme brahman all quiet shines forth\n gods seers manes prevail not there\n the awakened knower the allknower is brahman\n in this context there are the following verses hence the seeker after liberation must from object his mind withdraw for liberation is indeed mind s detachment from objects\n two kinds of minds there are pure and impure impure the mind desire ridden the pure of desires freed\n mind alone is cause of man s bondage and release bondage is clinging to objects the mind withdrawn therefrom promotes release\n shorn of attachment to objects and restricted to the heart mind thus ceases to be mind such is the state supreme\n control the mind until it quiescence reaches in the heart\n this is knowledge and meditation the rest is naught but words\n brahman is not thinkable alone nor unthinkable think not yet only think thus surely become brahman the same to all\n yogin dissolves himself with self in being through meditation high meditation on non self is deemed no meditation at all\n that brahman has no parts is beyond concepts wiyout blemish\n knowing i am that by slow degrees one brahman does become\n knowing it as beyond concepts endless wiyout cause or parallel immeasurable and beginningless the man of wisdom is released\n there is no restriction no origin none in bondage none who strives none seeks liberation aye none liberated this is truth\n in wakeful state in dreams in sleep know that the self is only one for one who passes beyond these states rebirth there is none\n one real self alone exists in diverse beings as one or many is it seen like moon in water s sheen\n as when a pot is moved the sky pot bound moves not so is the living self unmoved like sky when only pot has moved\n when repeated in different forms like pot from pot distinct he knows not in these divisions and yet at all times knows\n as long as illusions of words encompass one difference lasts when darkness is scattered it is unity one sees\n the lower brahman is the word the eternal when that wears off remains its knower shall for peace of mind on the eternal meditate\n two brahman s are to be pondered on the word and brahman supreme in the word well versed one attains brahman supreme\n the acute mind after study of texts on knowledge and wisdom intent must forsake all as one who seeks grain forsakes the husk perforce\n milk has but a single colour though drawn from diverse cows as milk is knowledge known its sources are like cows\n focussing the eye of knowledge evoke the yought i am brahman the great supreme abode wiyout parts or movement the quiescent one\n whoso knows thus the one supreme form of brahman the fourth abiding in all beings dwells in the imperishable supreme abode\n i seek refuge for the sake of life in this fourth power of knowledge the cause of the manifestation of brahman\n in the order of akasa etc\n akasa is the supreme source of all these elements\n all these beings verily are born of akasa and they merge in akasa\n because of it they live once they are born\n so know akasa to be the seed\n that very thing know as the seat of akasa of air of fire of water of precious stones\n whoso knows this attains immortality\n therefore whoever knows this fourth wisdom or vidya pertaining to the glory of kamaraja the self in liberation with its elevenfold form as the imperishable brahman attains the fourth state whoever knows this\n this is the great upanishad\n om gods with ears let us hear what is

functions dependent upon a base like jati dravya kriya guna \n because of the absence of any such base words recoil from brahman \n for how can the word function in respect of the absolute bliss devoid of any base this subtle mind which makes all things its object turns back from that from which retreat also the senses hearing touch sight etc\n as well as the organs of actions they are not capable of reaching the supreme\n realizing that brahman which is bliss wiyout a second devoid of attributes the solidarity of truth and consciousness as one s own self one fears nought\n he who knows thus from the teaching of his guru who becomes master of himself never suffers from the impact of good or bad actions\n the whole world which appeared formerly as the inflictor and the inflicted now shines as one s own self owing to the knowledge arising from the vedantic teaching\n the pure brahman god the individual self the knower the means of knowledge the object of knowledge and the result thus for empirical purposes is the sevenfold distinction made\n the consciousness devoid of the condition of maya cosmic nescience is termed pure brahman \n when related to the cosmic nescience it is god\n under the influence of the individual nescience avidya it is the individual self\n when related to the internal organ it is called the knower\n in relationship with the modifications of the internal organ it is called the means of knowledge\n the consciousness which is not known is termed object and the consciousness which is known is called result \n the intelligent man should meditate upon his own self as devoid of all conditioning\n he who knows this in reality becomes brahman itself\n now i speak of the true essence of the teaching of all vedanta dying oneself becoming oneself

worshipping whom can i please the devas in whole hearing these words sri veda vyasa replied thus rudra is the embodiment of all devas\n all devas are merely different manifestations of sri rudra himself\n on the right side of rudra there is the sun then the four headed brahma and then three agnis fires \n on the left side there exist sri umadevi and also vishnu and soma moon \n uma herself is the form of vishnu\n vishnu himself is the form of the moon\n therefore those who worship lord vishnu worship siva himself\n and those who worship siva worship lord vishnu in reality\n those who envy and hate sri rudra are actually hating sri vishnu\n those who decry lord siva decry vishnu himself\n rudra is the generator of the seed\n vishnu is the embryo of the seed\n siva himself is brahma and

and immobile creation of this universe is filled up with uma and rudra\n the vyakta is sri uma and the avyakta is lord siva\n the combination of uma and sankara is vishnu\n hence everybody should

vishnu\n the action is brahma\n the cause is siva\n for the benefit of the worlds\n rudra has taken these three forms\n vishnu is the world\n therefore do kirtan of his name rudra rudra \n by singing

or by the mind\n after knowing this there is nothing more to be known because everything is the form of that and there is nothing separate from that\n there are two vidyas to be known\n they are para and apara\n apara vidya is the embodiment of the four vedas and their six angas\n they do not deal with the nature of the atman\n but the para vidya is called the moksha sastra\n it deals with that supreme philosophy of the absolute truth ununderstandable impersonal nirguna nirakara wiyout ears wiyout eyes wiyout hands wiyout feet eternal omnipresent imperishable and knowable by the intelligent daring sages\n from that lord siva who performs a terrible penance in the form of supreme jnana marga this whole world is created which is the food of the mortals\n this world is maya\n it seems to appear just like a dream\n it is superimposed on the lord just like a rope on a serpent\n this is the eternal truth\n there is no creation in reality\n knowing this one is liberated at once\n only through jnana you can get rid of this samsara\n only through jnana you can understand this existence and never through karma\n understand this through the guidance of a brahmanishtha srotriya guru\n the guru will give the disciple all the necessary knowledge of brahman the absolute\n by cutting off the bondage of ajnana or avidya one should take refuge in lord sadasiva\n this is the real wisdom to be understood by an aspirant seeking after truth\n the pranava is the bow\n the atman is the arrow\n the para brahman is the target\n just like the arrow the atman will become one with brahman\n but all these three the bow the arrow and the target are not different from that sadasiva\n there do not shine the bodies of the sun moon or the stars\n there does not blow the wind there do not exist many devatas\n he the one lord only exists\n he only the purity of purities shines for ever and ever\n there are two birds in this body the jiva and the paramatman\n the jiva eats the fruit of his karmas but the paramatman is untouched by anything\n the paramatman is only the sakshi\n he does not do anything\n he only assumes the form of the jiva through his maya just as the akasa inside a pot seems to be different from the akasa outside and assumes the form of the pot\n in reality all is siva advaita the one absolute\n there is no difference of whatever kind\n when all is understood to be one omkara the absolute there is no sorrow there is no maya\n then the attainment of the advaita paramananda is very easy\n think that you are the basis of all this universe you are the one kevala sat chit ghana\n all people cannot understand this truth\n those devoid of maya can know this secret\n after knowing this the atman does not move towards any place at any time\n it becomes one with the absolute just like ghatakasa with paramakasa\n just as akasa does not move anywhere similarly this atman does not have any movement\n it becomes one with om\n one who knows this great secret truth is the real muni\n he becomes the para brahman itself\n he attains permanent peace\n om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the rudra hridayopanishad belonging to the krishna yajur veda",
    "Yoga-kundali": "om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me chapter i \n chitta has two causes vasanas and prana vayu\n if one of them is controlled then both are controlled\n of these two a person should control prana vayu always through moderate food postures and thirdly sakti chala\n i shall explain the nature of these\n listen to it o gautama\n one should take a sweet and nutritious food leaving a fourth of his stomach unfilled in order to please shiva the patron of yogins \n this is called moderate food\n posture herein required is of two kinds padma and vajra\n placing the two heels over the two opposite thighs respectively is the padma posture which is the destroyer of all sins\n placing one heel below the mulakanda and the other over it and sitting with the neck body and head erect is the vajra posture\n the sakti mentioned above is only kundalini\n a wise man should take it up from its place viz\n the navel upwards to the middle of the eyebrows\n this is called sakti chala\n in pracit ising it two things are necessary sarasvati chalana and the restraint of prana breath \n then through practice kundalini which is spiral becomes straightened\n of these two i shall explain to you first sarasvati chalana\n it is said by the wise of old that sarasvati is no other than arundhati\n it is only by rousing her up that kundalini is roused\n when prana breath is passing through one s ida left nostril he should assume firmly padma posture and should lengthen inwards digits the akasa of digits\n then the wise man should bind the sarasvati nadi by means of this lengthened breath and holding firmly together both his ribs near the navel by means of the forefingers and thumbs of both hands one hand on each side should stir up kundalini with all his might from right to left often and often for a period of two muhurtas minutes he should be stirring it up fearlessly\n then he should draw up a little when kundalini enters susumna\n by this means kundalini enters the mouth of susumna\n prana also having left that place enters of itself the susumna along with kundalini \n by compressing the neck one should also expand the navel\n then by shaking sarasvati prana goes above to the chest\n through the contraction of the neck prana goes above from the chest\n sarasvati who has sound in her womb should be shaken or thrown into vibration each day\n therefore by merely shaking it one is cured of diseases\n gulma a splenetic disease jalodara dropsy pliha a splenetic disease and all other diseases arising within the belly are undoubtedly destroyed by shaking this sakti\n i shall now briefly describe to you pranayama\n prana is the vayu that moves in the body and its restraint within is known as kumbhaka\n it is of two kinds sahita and kevala\n one should pracit ise sahita till he gets kevala\n there are four bhedas lit\n piercings or divisions viz\n surya ujjayi sitali and bhastri\n the kumbhaka associated with these four is called sahita kumbhaka\n being seated in the padma posture upon a pure and pleasant seat which gives ease and is neither too high nor too low and in a place which is pure lovely and free from pebbles etc\n and which for the length of a bow is free from cold fire and water one should shake or throw into vibration sarasvati \n slowly inhaling the breath from outside as long as he desires through the right nostril he should exhale it through the left nostril\n he should exhale it after purifying his skull by forcing the breath up \n this destroys the four kinds of evils caused by vayu as also by intestinal worms\n this should be done often and it is this which is spoken of as surya bheda\n closing the mouth and drawing up slowly the breath as before with the nose through both the nadis or nostrils and retaining it in the space between the heart and the neck one should exhale it through the left nostril\n this destroys the heat caused in the head as well as the phlegm in the throat\n it removes all diseases purifies his body and increases the gastric fire within\n it removes also the evils arising in the nadis jalodara waterbelly or dropsy and dhatus\n this kumbhaka is called ujjayi and may be pracit ised even when walking or standing\n drawing up the breath as before through the tongue with the hissing sound of sa and retaining it as before the wise man should slowly exhale it through both the nostrils\n this is called sitali kumbhaka and destroys diseases such as gulma pitha consumption bile fever thirst and poison\n seated in the padma posture with belly and neck erect the wise man should close the mouth and exhale with care through the nostrils\n then he should inhale a little with speed up to the heart so that the breath may fill the space with noise between the neck and skull\n then he should exhale in the same way and inhale often and often\n just as the bellows of a smith are moved viz\n stuffed with air within and then the air is let out so he should move the air within his body\n if the body gets tired then he should inhale through the right nostril\n if his belly is full of vayu then he should press well his nostrils with all his fingers except his forefinger and performing kumbhaka as before should exhale through the left nostril\n this frees one from diseases of fire in or inflammation of the throat increases the gastric fire within enables one to know the kundalini produces purity removing sins gives happiness and pleasure and destroys phlegm which is the bolt or obstacle to the door at the mouth of brahma nadi viz\n it pierces also the three granthis or knots differentiated through the three gunas\n this kumbhaka is known as bhastri and should especially be performed\n through these four ways when kumbhaka is near or is about to be performed the sinless yogin should pracit ise the three bandhas\n the first is called mulabandha\n the second is called uddiyana and the third is jalandhara\n their nature will be thus described\n apana breath which has a downward tendency is forced up by one bending down\n this process is called mulabandha\n when apana is raised up and reaches the sphere of agni fire then the flame of agni grows long being blown about by vayu\n then agni and apana come to or commingle with prana in a heated state\n through this agni which is very fiery there arises in the body the flaming or the fire which rouses the sleeping kundalini through its heat\n then this kundalini makes a hissing noise becomes erect like a serpent beaten with stick and enters the hole of brahmanadi susumna \n therefore yogins should daily pracit ise mulabandha often\n uddiyana should be performed at the end of kumbhaka and at the beginning of expiration\n because prana uddiyate viz\n goes up the susumna in this bandha therefore is called uddiyana by the yogins\n being seated in the vajra posture and holding firmly the two toes by the two hands he should press at the kanda and at the place near the two ankles\n then he should gradually upbear the tana thread or nadi which is on the western side first to udara the upper part of the abdomen above the navel then to the heart and then to the neck\n when prana reaches the sandhi junction of navel slowly it removes the impurities or diseases in the navel\n therefore this should be frequently pracit ised\n the bandha called jalandhara should be pracit ised at the end of kumbhaka\n this jalandhara is of the form of the contraction of the neck and is an impediment to the passage of vayu upwards \n when the neck is contracted at once by bending downwards so that the chin may touch the breast prana goes through brahmanadi on the western tana in the middle\n assuming the seat as mentioned before one should stir up sarasvati and control prana\n on the first day kumbhaka should be done four times on the second day it should be done ten times and then five times separately \n on the third day twenty times will do and afterwards kumbhaka should be performed with the three bandhas and with an increase of five times each day\n diseases are generated in one s body through the following causes viz\n sleeping in daytime late vigils over night excess of sexual intercourse moving in crowd the checking of the discharge of urine and faeces the evil of unwholesome food and laborious mental operation with prana\n if a yogin is afraid of such diseases when attacked by them he says my diseases have arisen from my practice of yoga \n then he will discontinue this practice\n this is said to be the first obstacle to yoga\n the second obstacle is doubt the third is carelessness the fourth laziness the fifth sleep \n the sixth the not leaving of objects of sense the seventh erroneous perception the eighth sensual objects the ninth want of faith \n and the tenth the failure to attain the truth of yoga\n a wise man should abandon these ten obstacles after great deliberation\n the practice of pranayama should be performed daily with the mind firmly fixed on truth\n then chitta is absorbed in susumna and prana therefore never moves\n when the impurities of chitta are thus removed and prana is absorbed in susumna he becomes a true yogin\n apana which has a downward tendency should be raised up with effort by the contraction of the anus and this is spoken of as mulabandha\n apana thus raised up mixes with agni and then they go up quickly to the seat of prana\n then prana and apana uniting with one another go to kundalini which is coiled up and asleep\n kundalini being heated by agni and stirred up by vayu extends her body in the mouth of susumna pierces the brahmagranthi formed of rajas and flashes at once like lightning at the mouth of susumna\n then it goes up at once through vishnugranthi to the heart\n then it goes up through rudragranthi and above it to the middle of the eyebrows having pierced this place it goes up to the mandala sphere of the moon\n it dries up the moisture produced by the moon in the anahata chakra having sixteen petals\n when the blood is agitated through the speed of prana it becomes bile from its contact with the sun after which it goes to the sphere of the moon where it becomes of the nature of the flow of pure phlegm\n how does it blood which is very cold become hot when it flows there \n since at the same time the intense white form of moon is speedily heated\n then being agitated it goes up\n through taking in this chitta which was moving amidst sensual objects externally is restrained there\n the novice enjoying this high state attains peace and becomes devoted to atman\n kundalini assumes the eight forms of prakriti matter and attains shiva by encircling him and dissolves itself in shiva\n thus rajas sukla seminal fluid which rises up goes to shiva along with marut vayu prana and apana which are always produced become equal\n pranas flow in all things great and small describable or indescribable as fire in gold\n then this body which is adhibhautika composed of elements becomes adhidaivata relating to a tutelar deity and is thus purified\n then it attains the stage of ativahika\n then the body being freed from the inert state becomes stainless and of the nature of chit\n in it the ativahika becomes the chief of all being of the nature of that\n like the conception of the snake in a rope so the idea of the release from life and samsara is the delusion of time\n whatever appears is unreal\n whatever is absorbed is unreal\n like the illusory conception of silver in the mother of pearl so is the idea of man and woman\n the microcosm and the macrocosm are one and the same so also the linga and sutratman svabhava substance and form and the self resplendent light and chidatma\n the sakti named kundalini which is like a thread in the lotus and is resplendent is biting with the upper end of its hood namely mouth at the root of the lotus the mulakanda\n taking hold of its tail with its mouth it is in contact with the hole of brahmarandhra of susumna \n if a person seated in the padma posture and having accustomed himself to the contraction of his anus makes his vayu go upward with the mind intent on kumbhaka then agni comes to svadhisthana flaming owing to the blowing of vayu\n from the blowing of vayu and agni the chief kundalini pierces open the brahmagranthi and then vishnugranthi\n then it pierces rudragranthi after that all the six lotuses or plexuses \n then sakti is happy with shiva in sahasrara kamala lotuses seat or pineal gland \n this should be known as the highest avastha state and it alone is the giver of final beatitude\n thus ends the first chapter\n chapter ii \n i shall hereafter describe the science called khechari which is such that one who knows it is freed from old age and death in this world\n one who is subject to the pains of death disease and old age should o sage on knowing this science make his mind firm and pracit ise khechari\n one should regard that person as his guru on earth who knows khechari the destroyer of old age and death both from knowing the meaning of books and practice and should perform it with all his heart\n the science of khechari is not easily attainable as also its practice\n its practice and melana are not accomplished simultaneously\n those that are bent upon practice alone do not get melana\n only some get the practice o brahmana after several births but melana is not obtained even after a hundred births\n having undergone the practice after several births some solitary yogin gets the melana in some future birth as the result of his practice\n when a yogin gets this melana from the mouth of his guru then he obtains the siddhis mentioned in the several books\n when a man gets this melana through books and the significance then he attains the state of shiva freed from all rebirth\n even gurus may not be able to know this wiyout books\n therefore this science is very difficult to master\n an ascetic should wander over the earth so long as he fails to get this science and when this science is obtained then he has got the siddhi in his hand viz\n mastered the psychical powers \n therefore one should regard as achyuta vishnu the person who imparts the melana as also him who gives out the science\n he should regard as shiva him who teaches the practice\n having got this science from me you should not reveal it to others\n therefore one who knows this should protect it with all his efforts viz\n should never give it out except to persons who deserve it \n o brahmana one should go to the place where lives the guru who is able to teach the divine yoga and there learn from him the science khechari and being then taught well by him should at first pracit ise it carefully\n by means of this science a person will attain the siddhi of khechari\n joining with khechari sakti viz\n kundalini sakti by means of the science of khechari which contains the bija seed of letter of khechari one becomes the lord of khecharas devas and lives always amongst them\n khechari bija seed letter is spoken of as agni encircled with water and as the abode of khecharas devas \n through this yoga siddhi is mastered\n the ninth bija letter of somamsa soma or moon part should also be pronounced in the reverse order\n then a letter composed of three amsas of the form of moon has been described and after that the eight letter should be pronounced in the reverse order \n then consider it as the supreme and its beginning as the fifth and this is said to the kuta horns of the several bhinnas or parts of the moon\n this which tends to the accomplishment of all yogas should be learnt through the initiation of a guru\n he who recites this twelve times every day will not get even in sleep that maya illusion which is born in his body and which is the source of all vicious deeds\n he who recites this five lakhs of times with very great care to him the science of khechari will reveal itself\n all obstacles vanish and the devas are pleased\n the destruction of valipalita viz\n wrinkle and greyness of hair will take place wiyout doubt\n having acquired this great science one should pracit ise it afterwards\n if not o brahmana he will suffer wiyout getting any siddhi in the path of khechari\n if one does not get this nectar like science in this practice he should get it in the beginning of melana and recite it always else one who is wiyout it never gets siddhi\n as soon as he gets this science he should pracit ise it and then the sage will soon get the siddhi\n having drawn out the tongue from the root of the palate a knower of atman should clear the impurity of the tongue for seven days according to the advice of his guru\n he should take a sharp knife which is oiled and cleaned and which resembles the leaf of the plant snuhi euphorbia antiquorum and should cut for the space of a hair the fraenum lingui \n having powdered saindhava rock salt and payoura sea salt he should apply it to the place\n on the seventh day he should again cut for the space of a hair\n thus for the space of six months he should continue it always gradually with great care\n in six months siro bandha bandha at the head which is at the root of the tongue is destroyed\n then the yogin who knows timely action should encircle with siro vastra lit\n the cloth of the head the vak ishvari the deity presiding over speech and should draw it up\n again by daily drawing it up for six months it comes o sage as far as the middle of the eyebrows and obliquely up to the opening of the ears \n having gradually pracit ised it goes to the root of the chin\n then in three years it goes up easily to the end of the hair of the head \n it goes up obliquely to sakha and downwards to the well of the throat\n in another three years it occupies brahmarandhra and stops there wiyout doubt\n crosswise it goes up to the top of the head and downwards to the well of the throat\n gradually it opens the great adamantine door in the head\n the rare science of khechari bija has been explained before\n one should perform the six angas parts of this mantra by pronouncing it in six different intonations\n one should do this in order to attain all the siddhis \n and this karanyasam should be done gradually and not all at a time since the body of one who does it all at once will soon decay\n therefore it should be pracit ised o best of sages little by little\n when the tongue goes to the brahmarandhra through the outer path then one should place the tongue after moving the bolt of brahma which cannot be mastered by the devas\n on doing this for three years with the point of finger he should make the tongue enter within then it enters brahmadvara or hole \n on entering the brahmadvara one should pracit ise mathana churning well\n some intelligent men attain siddhi even wiyout mathana\n one who is versed in khechari mantra accomplishes it wiyout mathana\n by doing the japa and mathana one reaps the fruits soon\n by connecting a wire made of gold silver or iron with the nostrils by means of a thread soaked in milk one should restrain his breath in his heart and seated in a convenient posture with his eyes concentrated between his eyebrows he should perform mathana slowly\n in six months the state of mathana becomes natural like sleep in children\n and it is not advisable to do mathana always\n it should be done once only in every month\n a yogin should not revolve his tongue in the path\n after doing this for twelve years siddhi is surely obtained\n then he sees the whole universe in his body as not being different from atman\n this path of the urdhva kundalini higher kundalini o chief of kings conquers the macrocosm\n thus ends the second chapter\n chapter iii \n melana mantra hrim bham sam pam pham sam ksham\n the lotus born brahma said o shankara among new moon the first day of the lunar fortnight and full moon which is spoken of as its mantra s sign \n in the first day of lunar fortnight and during new moon and full moon days it should be made firm and there is no other way or time \n a man longs for an object through passion and is infatuated with passion for objects\n one should always leave these two and seek the niranjana stainless \n he should abandon everything else which he thinks is favourable to himself\n keeping the manas in the midst of sakti and sakti in the midst of manas one should look into manas by means of manas\n then he leaves even the highest stage\n manas alone is the bindu the cause of creation and preservation\n it is only through manas that bindu is produced like the curd from milk\n the organs of manas is not that which is situated in the middle of bandhana\n bandhana is there where sakti is between the sun and moon\n having known susumna and its bheda piercing and making the vayu go in the middle one should stand in the seat of bindu and close the nostrils\n having known vayu the above mentioned bindu and the sattva prakriti as well as the six chakras one should enter the sukha mandala viz\n the sahasrara or pineal gland the sphere of happiness \n there are six chakras\n muladhara is in the anus svadhisthana is near the genital organ manipuraka is in the navel anahata is in the heart visuddhi is at the root of the neck and ajna is in the head between the two eyebrows \n having known these six mandalas spheres one should enter the sukha mandala pineal gland drawing up the vayu and should send it vayu upwards\n he who pracit ises thus the control of vayu becomes one with brahmanda the macrocosm \n he should pracit ise or master vayu bindu chitta and chakra\n yogins attain the nectar of equality through samadhi alone\n just as the fire latent in sacrificial wood does not appear wiyout churning so the lamp of wisdom does not arise wiyout the abhyasa yoga or practice of yoga \n the fire placed in a vessel does not give light outside\n when the vessel is broken its light appears wiyout\n one s body is spoken of as the vessel and the seat of that is the fire or light within and when it the body is broken through the words of a guru the light of brahma jnana becomes resplendent\n with the guru as the helmsman one crosses the subtle body and the ocean of samsara through the affinities of practice\n that vak power of speech which sprouts in para gives forth two leaves in pashyanti buds forth in madhyama and blossoms in vaikhari that vak which has before been described reaches the stage of the absorption of sound reversing the above order viz\n beginning with vaikhari etc\n whoever thinks that he who is the great lord of that vak who is the undifferentiated and who is the illuminator of that vak is self whoever thinks over thus is never affected by words high or low or good or bad \n the three aspects of consciousness vishva taijasa and prajna in man the three virat hiranyagarbha and ishvara in the universe the egg of the universe the egg of man and the seven worlds all these in turn are absorbed in pratyagatman through the absorption of their respective upadhis vehicles \n the egg being heated by the fire of jnana is absorbed with its karana cause into paramatman universal self \n then it becomes one with para brahman\n it is then neither steadiness nor depth neither light nor darkness neither describable nor distinguishable\n sat be ness alone remains\n one should think of atman as being within the body like a light in a vessel\n atman is of the dimensions of a thumb is a light wiyout smoke and wiyout form is shining within the body and is undifferentiated and immutable\n the vijnana atman that dwells in this body is deluded by maya during the states of waking dreaming and dreamless sleep but after many births owing to the effect of good karma it wishes to attain its own state\n who am i how has this stain of mundane existence accrued to me what becomes in the dreamless sleep of me who am engaged in business in the waking and dreaming states just as a bale of cotton is burnt by fire so the chidabhasa which is the result of non wisdom is burnt by the wise youghts like the above and by its own supreme illumination\n the outer burning of body as done in the world is no burning at all\n when the worldly wisdom is destroyed pratyagatman that is in the dahara akasa or ether of the heart obtains vijnana diffusing itself everywhere and burns in an instant jnanamaya and manomaya sheaths \n after this he himself shines always within like a light within a vessel\n that muni who contemplates thus till sleep and till death is to be known as a jivanmukta\n having done what ought to be done he is a fortunate person\n and having given up even the state of a jivanmukta he attains videhamukta emancipation in a disembodied state after his body wears off\n he attains the state as if of moving in the air\n then that alone remains which is soundless touchless formless and deathless which is the rasa essence eternal and odourless which has neither beginning nor end which is greater than the great and which is permanent stainless and decayless\n thus ends the third chapter\n hari om tat sat om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the yogakundalini upanishad belonging to the krishna yajur veda",
    "Bhasma": "om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me i am that absolute brahman only which after being understood in its true aspect as one with this atman entirely burns into ashes bhasma the ignorance illusion or maya of considering this universe to be existing real and separate from one s own self through the destructive fire of supreme knowledge once bhusunda a descendant of jabali went to the kailas peak and prostrated before lord mahadeva siva who is the form of omkara and who is beyond the trinity of brahma vishnu and rudra\n bhusunda worshipped siva with great devotion again and again through fruits flowers and leaves\n then he questioned lord siva lord kindly impart to me the essential knowledge of all the vedas embodying the process and technique of using the bhasma sacred ash because it is the only means for attaining liberation\n what is the bhasma made of where should it be applied what are the mantras to be recited who are the persons fitted for this what are the rules regarding it kindly instruct me born from depressed class\n the kind lord paramesvara said at first the devotee after understanding the influence of the celestials at the prescribed time should fetch some sacred and pure cow dung early in the morning keep it in the leaf of a palasa tree and then dry it with the vedic mantra tryambakam etc\n then he should burn that dry cow dung placed in a convenient place with any fire that is available according to the rules laid down in the grihya sutras of his sect and then pour ahuit is of seasamum and paddy together with ghee with the mantra somaya svaha \n the number of ahuit is should be or if possible times this\n the instruments for pouring ghee should be made of leaf in that case man does not commit any sin\n then at the end the devotee should offer the oblation of sveshtakruta at the time of purna ahuti with the mantra tryambakam etc\n with the same mantra bali an offering should be placed in the eight directions of the fire \n that bhasma should be sprinkled with water by the gayatri mantra\n then that sacred ash should be placed in a gold silver copper or earthen vessel and sprinkled again with the rudra mantras\n it should then be kept in a clean and decent place\n then the devotee should honour the brahmins with a grand feast\n then only he will become purified\n then he should take the bhasma from the vessel with the pancha brahma mantras manastoka sadyo jatam etc\n and with the idea that fire is bhasma air is bhasma water is bhasma earth is bhasma ether is bhasma gods are bhasma rishis are bhasma all this universe and existence are bhasma i prostrate to this sacred and purifying bhasma which destroys all my sins\n thus the devotee should keep a little bhasma with the clean palm of his left hand saying vamadevaya this is to vamadeva sprinkling with the mantra tryambakam etc\n and cleaning it with the mantra suddham suddhena etc\n then he should filter it nicely\n then he should apply it from head to foot with the five brahma mantras\n with the first finger middle finger and ring finger he should apply the same to the middle of the head saying to the head and o bhasma thou hast come from agni he should apply bhasma at the top of the head with the mantra murdhanam\n on the forehead with tryambakam etc\n on the neck with nilagrivaya etc\n on the right side of the neck with tryayusham etc\n on the cheeks with kalaya etc\n on the eyes with trilochanaya etc\n on the ears with srinavama etc\n on the mouth with prabravama etc\n on the heart chest with atmane etc\n on the navel with nabhih etc\n on the right shoulder with bhavaya etc\n on the right elbow with rudraya etc\n on the right wrist with sarvaya etc\n on the back of the right palm with pasupataye etc\n on the left shoulder with ugraya etc\n on the left elbow with agre vadhaya etc\n on the left wrist with dure vadhaya etc\n on the back of the left palm with namo hartre etc\n and over the shoulder blades with sankaraya etc\n the devotee should then prostrate to siva with the mantra somaya etc\n he should wash the hands and drink that ash water with the mantra apah punantu etc\n the water should never be spilt down from any cause\n thus this practice of bhasmadharana should be done in the morning noon and evening\n if he does not do this he will become fallen\n this very thing is the prescribed dharma of all brahmins\n wiyout having bhasmadharana in this fashion he should never take any food water or anything else\n accidentally if this practice is forgotten that day gayatri should not be repeated\n no yajna should be done on that day no tarpana should be offered to gods rishis or pitrus\n this is the eternal dharma that destroys all sins and gives the final state of moksha\n this is the daily rite of brahmins brahmacharins grihasthas vanaprasthas and sannyasins\n if this is overlooked even once he should stand in water upto the neck repeating gayatri times and fast the whole day\n if a sannyasin does not wear bhasma even a single day he should fast during the whole day and do pranava japa for being purified once again\n otherwise the lord will throw these sannyasins to dogs and wolves\n in case this kind of bhasma is not available any other bhasma that may be at hand should be used with the prescribed mantras\n this kind of practice shall destroy any kind of sin that may be committed by man\n then again bhusunda asked siva what are the daily rites to be performed by a brahmin by neglecting which he will commit a sin who is to be then meditated upon who is to be remembered how to meditate where to practice this please tell me in detail\n the lord answered all in a nutshell first of all the devotee should get up early in the morning before sunrise and after finishing the purificatory actions should take his bath\n he should clean the body with the rudra suktas\n then he should wear a clean cloth\n after this he should meditate on the sun god and apply bhasma to all the prescribed parts of the body\n he should then wear white rudraksha as prescribed\n some prescribe the following way of wearing rudraksha beads over the head should be worn forty rudraksha beads\n one or three beads on the chest\n twelve beads over each of the two ears\n thirt two beads around the neck\n sixteen beads around each of the upper arms\n twelve beads around each of the wrists\n six beads around each of the thumbs\n then the devotee should observe sandhya with the kusa grass in his hand\n he should do japa of either siva shadakshara or siva ashtakshara\n om namah sivaya and om namo mahadevaya are the two mantras\n this is the highest truth and the greatest instruction\n i myself am that great lord siva god of all gods the supreme controller of all the universes\n i am that impersonal brahman i am omkara i am the creator preserver and destroyer of all\n through my terror only all are working properly\n i am this world and the five elements\n i am the highest truth that exists the brahman of the upanishads\n this is the greatest vidya\n i am the only giver of moksha\n hence all people come to me for final help\n that is why i absorb into my being those creatures who leave their pranas at banares which is standing at the top of my trisula trident \n therefore everyone should perform penance at banares only\n banares should not be neglected under any circumstance\n everybody should try to live at banares as far as possible\n no place is better than banares\n even at banares the most celebrated is the temple of siva where in the east there is the place of wealth in the south the place of vichara in the west the place of vairagya and in the north the place of jnana\n there in the middle i the eternal spirit should be worshipped\n that linga at banares is not illumined by the sun moon or the stars\n that self luminous linga called visvesvara has its root in pathala\n i should be worshipped by one who wears the sacred bhasma and rudrakshas in the prescribed manner\n i shall deliver him from all sins and sorrows\n by performing my abhisheka he attains my sayujya state\n nothing exists other than myself\n i initiate all with the taraka mantra\n those who want mukti should live at banares\n i will take care of them\n i am the lord of brahma vishnu and rudra\n the most corrupt man or woman will attain moksha if he or she dies at banares\n other sinners will be fried in burning pits of live coals after death\n therefore everybody should try to live at banares which is my pranalinga itself\n om o devas may we hear with our ears what is auspicious may we see with our eyes what is auspicious o ye woryour of worship may we enjoy the term of life allotted by the devas praising them with our body and limbs steady may the glorious indra bless us may the all knowing sun bless us may garuda the thunderbolt for evil bless us may brihaspati grant us well being om let there be peace in me let

    "Rudraksha": "om let my limbs and speech prana eyes ears vitality and all the senses grow in strength\n all existence is the brahman of the upanishads\n may i never deny brahman nor brahman deny me\n let there be no denial at all let there be no denial at least from me\n may the virtues that are proclaimed in the upanishads be in me who am devoted to the atman may they reside in me\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me hail om i praise the effulgent state of absolute peace belonging to sri maharudra which is to be known through the rudraksha jabala upanishad\n bhusunda questioned lord kalagnirudra what is the beginning of rudraksha beads what is the benefit of wearing them on the body lord kalagnirudra answered him thus i closed my eyes for the sake of destroying the tripura asuras\n from my eyes thus closed drops of water fell on the earth\n these drops of tears turned into rudrakshas\n by the mere utterance of the name of rudraksha one acquires the benefit of giving ten cows in charity\n by seeing and touching it one attains double that benefit\n i am unable to praise it any more\n i closed my eyes one yousand celestial years\n then from my eyelids drops of water dropped down and attained the state of immobility for blessing the devoted persons\n this rudraksha destroys the devotees sins that are committed both night and day by wearing it\n by mere vision of the rudraksha the benefit will be say a lac\n but by wearing them it will be a crore\n why it will be equal to hundred crores\n but it will be a yousand lacs of crores and hundred lacs of crores times powerful when one does japa with rudraksha and wears it at all times\n among rudrakshas one as big as amalaka myrobalan is considered to be the best\n one as big as the badari fruit indian berry is considered to be of the middle sort\n but that as big as chana bengal gram is considered to be the worst of all\n this is my idea about the size of rudraksha beads\n the four kinds of people brahmins kshatriyas vaisyas and sudras are born as merely a worthless burden on the earth\n the real brahmin is the white rudraksha\n the red is a kshatriya\n the yellow is a vaisya\n and the black is a sudra\n therefore a brahmin should wear white rudrakshas a kshatriya the red a vaisya the yellow and a sudra the black\n one should use those rudraksha beads which are nice handsome strong big auspicious and thorny\n one should avoid those eaten by worms broken wiyout thorns and having sores\n the self holed rudraksha is of the best variety\n but that which is holed by man s attempt is considered to be worse\n those best rudrakshas should be strung in white thread\n a worshipper of siva should wear rudraksha all over the body\n he should wear one bead on the crest three hundred round the head thirty six round the neck sixteen round each arm twelve round the chest and five hundred round the waist\n he should wear a yajnopavita consisting of one hundred and eight beads of rudrakshas\n he should wear two three five or seven malas of rudraksha round the neck\n a siva bhakta should wear rudrakshas round his crown ear ring chain round the ear armlet at all times and specially round the stomach irrespective of the fact whether he is sleeping drinking etc\n if the devotee wears three hundred beads it is the worst if he wears five hundred it will be medium but one yousand will be the best of all\n the devotee when wearing rudrakshas on the head should repeat his ishta mantra and when wearing them round the neck should repeat the tat purusha mantra and when wearing round the throat should repeat the aghora mantra\n the same mantra aghora should be recited when wearing round the chest also\n he should wear them round the arms with the aghora bija mantra\n then again bhusunda asked lord kalagnirudra what are the different forms and effects of rudraksha beads please tell me about the secret of these blessed ones including their various faces which is the means of getting rid of all evil\n lord kalagnirudra said the bead with one face is of the form of the supreme truth\n a disciplined one controlling his senses mingles himself with the one eternal truth after wearing these rudrakshas\n the bead with two faces is of the form of ardhanarisvara and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of ardhanarisvara siva united with sakti \n the bead with three faces is of the form of the three fires and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of agni\n the bead with four faces is of the form of the fourfaced brahma and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of brahma\n the bead with five faces is of the form of panchabrahmaan the five faced siva and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of panchabrahmaan and drives away the sin of homicide\n the bead with six faces is of the form of the sixfaced kartikeya or ganesha and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of wealth and health clear intellect and wisdom and purification\n the bead with seven faces is of the form of the seven matras mother goddesses and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of wealth and health right perception and purity of mind\n the bead with eight faces is of the form of the eight fold nature five elements mind ego and matter or the eight vasus and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of these devatas and becomes truthful\n the bead with nine faces is of the form of the nava sakit is and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of the nine powers\n the bead with ten faces is of the form of the ten yamas means used by yogins and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of achieving peace of the mind\n the bead with eleven faces is of the form of the eleven rudras and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of increase well being and wealth\n the bead with twelve faces is of the form of mahavishnu or the twelve adityas and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of moksha\n the bead with thirteen faces is of the form of the kama cupid or the god of love and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of cupid in gratifying all desires\n the bead with fourteen faces is of the form of rudra being generated out of his eyes and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of destruction of all diseases\n one who wears rudrakshas should not use intoxicants meat garlic onions carrots and all such prohibited things\n by wearing rudrakshas during eclipses vishusankranti the end of mina and beginning of mesha masa new moon full moon and other such auspicious days one is freed of all sins\n the base of the rudraksha bead is brahma its navel is vishnu its face is rudra and its hole consists of all gods\n one day sanatkumara asked kalagnirudra o lord tell me the rules for wearing rudrakshas \n at that time nidagha jadabharata dattatreya katyayana bharadvaja kapila vasishtha pippalada etc\n then lord kalagnirudra asked them why they all had come in a group\n they all answered that they came to hear the method of wearing rudrakshas\n kalagnirudra said those that are born out of rudra s akshis eyes are called rudrakshas\n when these beads are even once touched by hand one attains the glory of giving in charity two yousand cows at a time\n when they are worn in ears he gets the effect of giving out eleven yousand cows in charity\n he also attains the state of the eleven rudras\n when the beads are worn on the head one has the benefit of giving a crore of cows in charity\n of all these places i am unable to tell you the benefit when worn in the ears\n whoever studies this rudraksha jabala upanishad be he a boy or a youth becomes great\n he becomes the guru of all and the teacher of all mantras\n havan and archana should be done with these mantras of the upanishad \n that brahmin who recites this upanishad in the evening destroys the sins committed during day time who recites at noon destroys the sins of six births who recites in the morning and evening destroys the sins of many births\n he attains the same benefit of doing six yousand lacs of gayatri japa\n he becomes purified from all sins of killing a brahmin drinking toddy stealing gold approaching guru s wife having intercourse with her speaking with corrupted person etc\n he gets the benefits of all pilgrimages and river baths\n he attains siva sayujya\n he does not come back to rebirth \n om let my limbs and speech prana eyes ears vitality and all the senses grow in strength\n all existence is the brahman of the upanishads\n may i never deny brahman nor brahman

world\n sankrithi is a great devotee and a sage and is an expert in yoga and also a disciple of dattatreya\n he approached his teacher god dattatreya with humility and with folded hands when his teacher was alone and requested him oh god please tell me about the science of yoga which has eight branches and five different sthanas places by knowing which i will attain salvation\n dattatreya told him hey sankrithi i shall tell you about yoga which has eight branches\n the eight branches are yama niyama aasana pranayama prayourahara dharana dhyana and samadhi\n yama which is the first is the practice of non violence truth non possession of properties of others celibacy mercy honesty patience stability food discipline and cleanliness\n niyama is the ten aspects of penance joy orthodoxy charity worship of god hearing of philosophy fear for bad actions clear intellect chanting and austerities\n the nine important asanas sitting positions are swasthika swastika gomukha cows face padma lotus veera valorous simha lion badra safe muktha free mayura peacock and sukha pleasant \n oh sage that position whatever it may be but which makes you comfortable and gives you courage to undertake yoga is called sukhasana\n people who do not have strength to take up other positions can use that\n victory in the seating position is like victory over the three worlds\n once the asana is fixed one should practice pranayama\n either in the top of the mountain or by the shore of the river or under a bilwa tree in the forest after choosing a clean place which is acceptable to the mind and after establishing a place to do tapas asram sit in the asana which is most familiar facing either east or north\n then sit with the body neck and head in a straight line cover the face and concentrate the vision with best possible attention on the nectar flowing from the fourth state of the moon like dot at the end of the nose\n draw the air inside using the lungs store it in the stomach meditate on the flame of fire inside the body and then shift meditation to the root of fire with its sound and dot\n then the intelligent one will exhale and draw the prana using pingala nadi which is tawny and is on the right side of sushumna nadi and meditate on the agni bheeja\n again he has to exhale and inhale again in the middle using the ida nadi which is pleasant and is on the left side of sushumna \n one should have to live in a secret place practicing this exercise six times for days or weeks at dawn noon and dusk\n this would help him to clean up the nadis\n slowly symbols will start showing up\n body will become light the fire in the stomach will burn well and the voice would become clearer\n these are the symbols of siddhi getting mastery \n till you see this you have to practice\n now i will tell you about prayourahara\n to use force and divert the sensory organs which normally travel according to their nature is prayourahara\n those who know brahma say that seeing whatever we see as the form of brahman is prayourahara\n prayourahara also is doing clean or unclean acts as those belonging to brhaman\n further doing daily religious activities after dedicating them to god and similarly doing the activities which we desire is also prayourahara\n apart from this inhaling air oxygen and stopping it in different places is also prayourahara\n the wise man would sit in swasthikasana draw his breath till it fills up from head to toe and hold it in two feet mooladhara stomach middle of the heart bottom of the neck jaw middle of the eyelids forehead and at the top of the skull\n then he should leave out the belief that the body is oneself and make that yought as nirvikalpa and merge it with paramatma\n the experts in vedanta say that this is true prayourahara\n there is nothing that cannot be attained by those who practice like this\n now i will tell you about the five types of dharana holding steady a stage in meditation here we try to hold on what we are mediating upon wiyout wavering \n in the sky which is in the middle of the body dharana of the sky outside should be made\n similarly in the breath dharana of air outside should be made\n in the fire in the stomach dharana of the fire outside should be made\n in the fluid aspects of the body dharana of the water outside should be made\n in the earyour aspects of the body dharana of the earth outside should be made\n sage also it is necessary to chant the pancha bhootha mantras viz\n ham yam ram vam and lam\n it is said that this very great dharana destroys all sins\n in the body up to the knee is the aspect of the earth from there till hip it is the aspect of water up to the heart is the aspect of fire up to middle of eyelids is the aspect of air and then up to the middle of the skull is the aspect of the sky\n in the aspect of earth brahma has to be placed in the aspect of water vishnu should be placed in the aspect of fire rudra should be placed in the aspect of air iswara should be placed and in the aspect of sky the sadashiva should be placed\n hey great sage i will also tell you another dharana\n in the jeevatma that lord shiva who rules over everything and is the personification of wisdom should be placed\n to get rid of all sins the wise man should suppress the gods like brahma in the causative self and place the avyakta that which is not clear which is formless and which is the root cause inside the entire soul with the chanting of pranava\n he should control the sensory organs by mind and should merge them with the soul\n i will now tell you about dhyana meditation which destroys sorrow\n dhyana should be done of that maheswara who is the medicine for problems arising out of birth who is the discipline and fundamental basis of the world who is of the form of para brahma who has the masculine power upwards who is of the form of the world who is virupaksha and who is the head of all yogis as i am he \n then continue to do dhyana of him who is beyond the reach of meditation who is the personification of sachidananda brahman and who is soul in person as i am he for attaining salvation\n in the mind of that great purusha who practices like this the science of vedanta would automatically appear\n there is no doubt about it\n now i will tell you about samadhi deep meditative state which destroys the ills of birth and death\n samadhi is that state in which there is knowledge that jeevatma and paramatma are one\n atma soul is filled all over for ever and does not have motion or stain\n though it is one due to the effects of illusion it appears as different objects\n really there is no difference between these so called objects\n when one sees all objects within himself and him as a part of all objects he attains brahman\n when one drowns himself in samadhi and does not see different objects as different then he attains the single aim of salvation\n when he sees only the true soul and the entire world appears as an illusion to him and he is cured of all sorrow\n thus advised by lord dattatreya the sage sankrithi fully lost all his fear and attained that blissfull state deep in himself\n om let my limbs and speech prana eyes ears vitality and all the senses grow in strength\n all existence is the brahman of the upanishads\n may i never deny brahman nor brahman deny me\n let there be no denial at all let there be no

of knowledge and bliss who is the rescuer from distress who is understood by vedanta who is the supreme spiritual master and who is the witness in everyone s heart\n some sages said to the demigod brahma who is the supreme personality of godhead whom does death fear by knowing whom does everything else become known who created this world\n brahma replied to them krishna is the supreme personality of godhead\n by understanding gopijanavallabha everything becomes known\n by pronouncing the word svaha the personality of godhead created the world\n they then said who is krishna who is govinda who is gopijanavallabha what is svaha \n to them brahma said krishna means he who delivers from sin govinda means he who is famous on the earth in the vedas and among the surabhi cows gopijanavallabha means he who enchants the gopis and svaha means the potency of the supreme\n all these names refer to the supreme personality of godhead\n one who meditates on this supreme personality of godhead glorifies him and worships him becomes liberated\n they said what is his form what is his glorification how does one worship him please describe this to us brahma said he appears like a cowherd boy\n his complexion is like a monsoon cloud\n he stays under a desire tree\n the following verses describe him\n meditating with all his heart on lord krishna whose eyes are handsome lotus flowers whose complexion is a monsoon cloud whose garments are lightning who has two arms who is rich in transcendental knowledge who wears a garland of forest flowers who is the supreme controller who is surrounded by gopas gopis and surabhi cows who rests under a sura druma tree who is decorated with splendid ornaments who stands in the middle of a red lotus flower and who is served by breezes that have touched the yamuna s waves a person becomes free from repeated birth and death\n this mantra should be repeatedly chanted klim krishnaya govindaya gopijanavallabhaya svaha \n by chanting these five names one attains the supreme personality of godhead whose potencies are manifested as the heavenly planets the earth sun moon and fire\n a person who even once chants the mantra klim krsnaya govindaya gopijanavallabha svaha quickly attains the association of lord krishna\n he does not attain any other result\n devotional service to lord krishna is performed when the heart no longer desires any material benefit to be obtained in this life or the next\n this is freedom from the bonds of karma\n many brahmaanas worship krishna\n many worship eternal govinda\n gopijanavallabha maintains the worlds\n powerful svaha moves the universe\n alyough originally one air becomes the five life airs in the bodies of all living entities\n in the same way for the benefit of the world lord krishna appears as these five words\n they said please describe the worship of govinda the supersoul who maintains everything\n brahma said the lord s altar should be a golden lotus with eight petals\n within that lotus should be placed two triangles and the mantra klim krsnaya namah the kama gayatri klim krsnaya govindaya gopijanavallabhaya svaha and the ananga gayatri kamadevaya sarva jana priyaya sarva janasammohanaya jvala jvala prajvala prajvala sarva janasya hrdayam me vasam kuru kuru svaha should be written there\n then anga should be offered with the sula

devotees headed by indranidhi\n he who at sunrise noon and sunset makes various offerings to the deity obtains everything\n in this matter there are the following verses lord krishna is the worshipable all pervading supreme controller and alyough he is one he manifests in many forms\n they who are intelligent worship him as he stands on his altar\n they and not others attain eternal happiness\n the brahmaanas who worship as he stands on his altar the one greatest among the eternals and greatest among conscious persons the one who fulfils the desires of the many they and not others attain perfection\n to they who always diligently worship lord visnu s transcendental form the lord in his original form as a cowherd boy shows his lotus feet\n it was krishna who in the beginning instructed brahma in vedic knowledge and who disseminated vedic knowledge in the past\n they who desire liberation surrender to him the supreme personality of godhead who grants transcendental knowledge to his devotees\n to they who chant the five word mantra with om and govinda om krsnaya govindaya gopijanavallabha svaha the lord reveals his own form\n therefore to attain transcendental peace they who desire liberation should regularly chant this mantra\n from this five word mantra have come all other govinda mantras in human society including the ten syllable govinda mantra chanted by indra s followers and by they who desire opulences\n they asked please tell us the nature of this mantra\n brahma said i continually glorified the lord and meditated upon him for millions of years and at last i was able to understand the transcendental form of the lord as sri krishna in the dress of a cowherd boy\n with devotion in my heart i bowed down before him\n he gave me the eighteen syllable mantra to be used for the activity of creation and then he disappeared\n when i desired to create the universe he again appeared before me showing me in these syllables the universe that was to be\n from the letter k i created water from the letter l earth from the letter i fire from the letter m the moon and from the entire word klim the sun\n from the word krsnaya i created ether from govindaya air from gopijanavallabha knowledge and the surabhi cows and from svaha men women and everything else\n by worshipping him shiva became free from illusion and by chanting this mantra in a solitary place he attained the lord\n the demigods gaze at visnu s abode which is like a splendid sun in the sky\n therefore one should regularly chant this mantra\n one should regularly chant this mantra\n some have said that from the first word of this mantra earth was created from the second word water from the third fire from the fourth air and from the fifth ether\n to attain liberation one should chant this five word vaishnava mantra which reveals lord krishna\n about this are the following verses one should chant this mantra of which from the first word the element earth came from the second word water from the third fire from the fourth air and from the fifth ether\n by chanting this mantra shiva entered lord visnu s eternal spiritual abode\n that spiritual world completely pure uncontaminated free from suffering free from greed and all other vices and identical with this five word mantra is manifested from lord vasudeva\n it is not separate from him\n with eloquent prayers i and the maruts please lord govinda whose form is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss who stays under a desire tree in vrndavana and who is this five word

bliss o lord who rescues the devotees from distress o madhava please rescue me\n brahma said as i worship him so should you\n chanting this five word mantra and meditating on lord krishna you will transcend the world of birth and death\n one who chants this five word mantra easily attains his transcendental abode\n alyough fixed in his abode the personality of godhead is swifter than the mind and can overcome all others running\n even the powerful demigods cannot approach him\n therefore krishna is the supreme personality of godhead\n one should meditate upon him glorify him serve him and worship him\n chapter two once after they had passed the entire night with him the passionate girls of vraja spoke to the cowherd boy krishna who is the supreme personality of godhead and he also spoke to them\n the gopis said to what brahmaana should charity be given \n krishna said durvasa\n the gopis said how will we cross the yamuna s waters and approach him from whom great blessings will come \n krishna said say the words krishna the brahmaacari and the yamuna will give you a path\n by remembering me a shallow person becomes deep\n by remembering me an impure person becomes pure\n by remembering me an impious person becomes pious\n by remembering me one full of material desires becomes desireless\n by remembering me a fool becomes learned\n after hearing these words they meditated on durvasa and with these words crossed the yamuna\n they went to the very sacred asrama and bowed down before durvasa muni the best of sages\n they gave to the brahmaana delicious foods made with milk and ghee\n pleased he bathed ate blessed them and gave them permission to go\n they said how will we cross the yamuna \n he said meditate on me as a sage that eats only durva grass and the yamuna will give you a path\n gandharvi srimati radharani the best among them reflected for a moment\n she said how is krishna a brahmaacari how is this sage a person that eats only durva grass \n accepting her as their leader the other girls became silent\n durvasa muni replied sound is contained within the element of ether alyough sound and ether are different\n sound is contained within ether\n this ether does not know\n how can i be a materialistic enjoyer\n touch is contained within the element of air alyough touch and air are different\n touch is contained within air\n this air does not know\n how can i be a materialistic enjoyer \n form is contained within the element of fire alyough form and fire are different\n form is contained within fire\n this fire does not know\n how can i be a materialistic enjoyer \n taste is contained within the element of water alyough taste and waste are different\n taste is contained within water\n this water does not know\n how can i be a materialistic enjoyer \n aroma is contained within the element of earth alyough aroma and earth are different\n aroma is contained within earth\n this earth does not know\n how can i be a materialistic enjoyer \n it is the mind that remains among the senses and accepts them\n when spirit is everything how does one think where does one go i am spirit how can i be a materialistic enjoyer \n your beloved krishna is the original creator of the two kinds of bodies\n on the tree of the body are two birds\n one is an expansion of the supreme personality of godhead\n he is a witness\n the other is an enjoyer\n they are an enjoyer and a non enjoyer\n the first enjoys and the second is krishna\n in him we do not find material so called knowledge and ignorance\n this ignorance and real knowledge are different\n how can krishna who is full of real knowledge become a materialistic enjoyer he who lusts after pleasure is lusty\n he who does not lust after pleasures is not lusty\n krishna who is free from birth and death who is unchanging who cannot be cut who stays by the yamuna who stays among the surabhi cows who protects the surabhi cows who stays among the cowherd boys who stays in all the vedas who is glorified by all the vedas who has entered all living entities and who controls all living entities is your husband\n gandharvi radha said why has the supreme personality of godhead taken birth among us as a cowherd boy o sage how do you know this about krishna what is his mantra what is his abode why has he taken birth in devaki s womb who is his elder brother balarama how is he worshipped why has the supreme personality of godhead who is far above the world of matter descended to this earth \n he said in the beginning only lord narayana existed\n in him the material worlds are woven as thread on a loom\n from his lotus heart the demigod brahma was born\n when brahma performed severe austerities lord narayana granted him a boon\n brahma chose a question\n lord narayana granted his request\n brahma said among your many incarnations which is the best the one that makes humans and demigods happy the one that remembering him they become liberated from repeated birth and death why is this incarnation the best \n as on the summit of mount meru are seven cities that fulfil all desires so on the earth are seven cities that fulfil desires and grant liberation\n among them the city of gopala puri is directly the spiritual world\n in this city the desires of the demigods and all other creatures are all fulfilled and everyone attains liberation\n protected by my cakra this city if mathura or gopala puri stands in this world as a lotus stands in a lake\n gopala puri contains these forests \n the great forest of brhadvana \n madhuvana the former residence of the madhu demon \n talavana full of palm trees \n kumudavana full of lotus flowers and water lilies \n khadiravana full of khadira trees \n bhadravana the favourite spot of lord balarama \n bhandiravana the great forest of banyan trees \n srivana the abode of the goddess of fortune \n lohavana the former residence of the demon loha and \n vrndavana ruled by the goddess vrnda devi\n in these forests the demigods human beings gandharvas nagas and kinnaras sing and dance\n the twelve adityas eleven rudras eight vasus seven sages brahma narada five vinayakas viresvara rudresvara ambikesvara ganesvara nilakanthesvara visvesvara gopalesvara bhadresvara and other lingas reside there\n these forests are divided into two groups \n krishnavana or krishna s forests and \nbhadravana or balarama s forests\n among these twelve forests some are sacred and others are most sacred\n there the demigods stay\n there the perfect beings attained perfection\n in this place are a deity of rama a deity of pradyumna a deity of aniruddha and a deity of krishna\n in this way there are twelve deities in the forests of mathura\n the rudras worship the first deity brahma worships the second brahma s sons worship the third the maruts worship the fourth the vinayakas worship the fifth the vasus worship the sixth the sages worship the seventh the gandharvas worship the eighth the apsaras worship the ninth the tenth deity is now invisible the eleventh deity has gone to his own planet and the twelfth deity is now on the earth\n they who worship this deity surpass death and attain liberation\n they cross beyond the three fold miseries of birth old age and death\n there are these verses lord krishna accompanied by his three potencies and by balarama aniruddha pradyumna and rukmini stays in delightful mathura puri which is worshipped by brahma and the other demigods and protected by the conch cakra club and sarnga bow\n these four names are identical with the name om\n one should think i am spiritual beyond material passion\n one should think i am lord gopaka s\n in this way one attains liberation\n he realizes his spiritual nature\n he becomes a knower of spirit\n because since the beginning of creation he lovingly protects alati the conditioned souls gopa he is known as gopala\n i am a spirit\n i am a part and parcel of krishna\n my spiritual form is eternally full of bliss\n the supreme personality of godhead is therefore known as gopala\n with all one s heart one should think i am gopala s\n lord gopala is unmanifest limitless and eternal\n lord narayana continued o brahma decorated with a forest flower garland and holding a conch disk mace and lotus i will reside eternally in mathura\n o brahma he who with all his heart meditates on me whose form is the resting place of all forms whose form is supremely powerful and splendid whose form is wonderful and who has no material form goes to my abode\n of this there is no doubt\n o brahma a resident of this earth planet who remains in the district of mathura and worships me as i appear in the form of the deity becomes very dear to me\n you should always worship me as krishna in mathura\n four kinds of men worship me\n following the devotional process prescribed for the age intelligent devotees in this world worship lord gopala who is accompanied by his elder brother balarama and queen rukmini\n i am unborn eternal gopala\n i am eternal pradyumna\n he who is intelligent worships me\n free from all impure desires the residents of krishnavana and bhadravana worship me following the regulations of bhakti i myself have spoken\n even they who formerly rejected the principles of religion and were swallowed up by the age of kali may become devoted to me and also reside in mathura\n anyone who becomes my sincere devotee becomes very dear to me\n as dear as you and your sons are as dear as shiva and hid associates as dear as the goddess of fortune laksmi\n brahma said how has the one supreme personality of godhead become four deities how has the single sacred syllable om become many \n the lord said to him before the material world was manifest only the supreme personality of godhead who is one wiyout a second existed\n from him came the impersonal brahman\n from that came the syllable om\n from om came the mahat tattva\n from the mahat tattva came false ego\n from false ego came the five tanmatras\n from them came the elements\n om is covered by these things\n i am the sacred syllable\n i am ageless deathless nectarean the fearless supreme great\n the eternal supreme personality of godhead manifested himself as the all pervading universal form\n in the same way the lord who is one wiyout a second by his transcendental potency expanded himself into four\n the sacred syllable om consists of three letters a u and m\n balarama the son of rohini is the letter a\n splendid pradyumna is the letter u\n intelligent

    "Yajnavalkya": "om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me \n now king janaka of the videhas respectfully approached the sage yajnavalkya and said revered sir expound to me renunciation \n yajnavalkya said having completed the stage of a celibate student one may become a house holder\n from the stage of the house holder he may become a forest dweller vanaprastha and then renounce\n or else he may become a mendicant monk from the stage of a celibate student or a house holder or a forest dweller\n there is also the provision that a person may renounce worldly life that very day on which distaste for it dawns on him whether he is not observing vows before the stage of renunciation or observes them whether he has undergone the prescribed ablution on completing the disciplined studentship or not whether he is one who has discontinued maintaining ritual fire at the death of his wife utsannagni or one who does not maintain the ritual fire anagnika \n some law givers prescribe the sacrifice called prajapatya of which god brahma is the presiding deity prior to a twice born embracing renunciation \n but yough thus prescribed he may not do so\n he shall only perform the sacrifice agneyi whose presiding deity is agni the god of fire \n for agni is the vital breath prana \n thereby he helps strengthens the vital breath\n then he shall perform the traidhataviya sacrifice whose presiding deity is the god indra \n by this sacrifice the three vital fluids become strong like fire namely the sattva semen rajas blood and tamas the dark one \n having performed the sacrifice in the prescribed manner he shall smell the holy fire reciting the following mantra oh fire this vital breath is your source as you are born at the proper time of the year you put on effulgence\n knowing him the atman your ultimate source may you merge with the prana your source \n may you increase our wealth of transcendent knowledge \n so reciting the mantra he shall smell the fire\n this is the source of fire this vital air\n may you go unto fire your source \n thus alone the mantra says\n having procured the holy fire from the house of a well versed vedic scholar in the village he shall be directed to smell the fire as described previously\n if he does not get the ritual fire he may offer oblations in the waters\n for water is presided over by all the gods\n reciting i offer the oblation to all the gods svaha he should tender the oblations and picking up a small portion of the offered oblation which is mixed with ghee he shall eat it as this is beneficial\n before eating the offered oblation he shall recite the mantra of liberation namely om which he shall realize as the essence of the three vedas\n he shall adore brahman existence knowledge and bliss as that connoted by om \n cutting off the tuft of hair and sacred thread he shall recite thrice i have renounced \n the royal sage janaka accepted this elucidation by saying indeed so it is revered yajnavalkya \n then prompted by king janaka the sage atri asked yajnavalkya how is one wiyout the sacred thread by wearing which alone he can perform rituals a brahmana yajnavalkya replied this alone is his sacred thread the conviction that self effulgent atman i am \n he shall then ceremoniously sip water thrice with the mantra reach the sea svaha having previously discarded his tuft and sacred thread \n this is the method to be adopted by those who renounce the world \n then in the case of those entitled to renunciation the mendicant monk wearing ochre coloured garment with shaven head accepting nothing except food for bare sustenance pure injuring none in yought word and deed austerely living on alms becomes fit for realizing brahman\n this is the path of the mendicant monks\n in the case of the kshatriyas and others not entitled to renunciation they may seek liberation by the path of the brave by courting death in the battle field or fast unto death as a discipline or enter into water to rise no more or enter fire or undertake the great journey in which they collapse by exhaustion \n for those entitled to renunciation this way has been prescribed by the god brahma the ascetic who has renounced the world sannyasin following this path realizes brahman\n thus it is stated in the vedanta \n thus indeed it is revered sir yajnavalkya appreciated the royal sage janaka \n there are the well known sages called paramahamsas as in the days of yore the sages samvartaka aruni svetaketu durvasas ribhu nidagha dattatreya suka vamadeva harita and others wearing no distinguishing marks with conduct beyond the ken of worldly people and who behaved as yough bereft of their senses yough perfectly sane\n averse to others wives and desire to stay in towns and discarding all these namely the threefold staff bamboo the water vessel the earthen plate used for a meal the ceremonial purification with water the tuft and the sacred thread internally as well as externally in the waters reciting bhuh svaha the paramahamsa shall seek the atman\n possessing a form as one new born i\n unclad unaffected by pairs of opposites such as heat and cold pleasure and pain accepting nothing except alms for bare sustenance well established in the path of the truth of brahman of pure mind receiving alms into the mouth lit\n into the vessel of the belly at the prescribed time in order to sustain life becoming equanimous at gain and loss of alms drinking water from the vessel of hand or from a water vessel begging alms but to store in the belly devoid of any other vessel the watering place serving as water vessel sheltering equanimous at gain and loss of it in an abode which is free from disturbance and is solitary such as an unoccupied house a temple a clump of tall grass or hay stack an ant hill the shade of a tree a potter s hut a hut where ritual fire is kept the sandy bank of a river a mountain thicket a cave a hollow in a tree the vicinity of a water fall or a piece of clean ground wiyout residing in a fixed abode making no efforts for gainful activity and deeply intent on the uprooting of good and bad actions such a sage who finally gives up his body in the state of renunciation is indeed a paramahamsa\n thus it has been declared \n the mendicant monk who is unclad lit\n clothed by the points of the compass salutes none has no desire for wife or son and is above aim and non aim becomes the supreme god\n here there are the verses \n to one who has become an ascetic earlier and who is equal to him in characteristics obeisance ought to be paid by an ascetic and never to any one else\n even ascetics are seen who are careless whose minds are in outward phenomenal things are talebearers eager to quarrel and whose views are condemned by the veda\n if an ascetic remains in identity with the highest self effulgent brahman which is beyond name etc\n then to whom shall he the knower of the atman pay obeisance then the activity of bowing ought not to be done\n if an ascetic is convinced that the supreme god has entered into beings as the individual self then he may fully prostrate on the ground before dog outcaste cow or donkey\n what possibly is charming in a woman who is a doll made of flesh in a cage of limbs which is moved by machinery and who is a conglomerate of tendons bones and joints \n are the eyes of a woman charming when we look at them after dissection into skin flesh blood and tears why then do you get infatuated in vain \n similarly oh sage is seen of the pearl necklace which shines bright adoring women in the onrush of the ganga water down the shining slopes of the meru mountain\n in cemeteries situated in remote places the same breast of a woman is eaten in due course by dogs as if it were a small morsel of food\n having attractive tresses and putting on collyrium women difficult to touch but pleasing to the eyes are verily the flames of the fire of sin and they burn men as yough they were straw\n women pleasing and cruel are the fuel for the hell fires that inflame even at a distance and yough juicy loveable are devoid of moisture flavour \n silly women are the nets spread by the hunter called cupid to entangle the bodies of men in the form of birds\n woman is the bait stuck in the fish hook at the string of evil propensity to catch men in the form of fish that are in the pond of worldly life and that are active in the mud of the mind\n enough of women to me forever who are the strong caskets to preserve all gems of evil and are the chains of misery\n he who has a woman with him has desire for enjoyment where is the scope for enjoyment to one who is wiyout woman discarding woman is discarding worldly life one shall be happy after abandoning worldly life\n a son unborn worries the would be parents for long when obtained in the womb he gives trouble due to miscarriage or the pangs of child birth\n when the boy is born there is the worry of evil planes illness etc\n and then his propensity to evil ways\n when invested with the sacred thread he does not become learned and if he becomes wise he refuses marriage\n in youth he takes to adultery etc\n and has the curse of poverty when he has a family\n there is no end of worry due to a son and if he is rich he suddenly may die\n the good ascetic has no fickleness of hands and feet he is not unsteady in his eyes and he is not loose with his speech conquering his senses he becomes one with brahman\n when a person of discrimination sees equality and oneness between an enemy a prisoner and his own body where is the scope for anger as towards the limbs of one s own body \n if you have any anger against a wrong doer how is it you do not have anger against anger as it forcibly blocks the path to duty wealth love and liberation \n my salutation to the anger against anger which well sets ablaze its substratum and which gives one dispassion and awakens one to one s faults\n where the people are always asleep the man of self control is wide awake where they are vigilant oh wise one the prince among the yogins is in deep sleep\n be convinced that there is consciousness here that all this is consciousness alone and is pervaded by consciousness that you are consciousness and i am consciousness and all these worlds are of consciousness\n ascetics should accept this the highest position of being a paramahamsa\n oh best of sages there is nothing higher than this\n thus ends the upanishad\n om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the yajnavalkyopanishad belonging to the sukla yajur veda",
    "Varaha": "om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me chapter i the great sage ribhu performed penance for twelve deva divine years\n at the end of the time the lord appeared before him in the form of a boar\n he said rise rise and choose your boon \n the sage got up and having prostrated himself before him said o lord i will not in my dream wish of you those things that are desired by the worldly\n all the vedas shastras itihasas and all the hosts of other sciences as well as brahma and all the other devas speak of emancipation as resulting from a knowledge of your nature\n so impart to me that science of brahman which treats of your nature\n then the boar shaped bhagavan lord said \n some disputants hold that there are twenty four tattvas principles and some thirty six whilst others maintain that there are ninety six\n i shall relate them in their order\n listen with an attentive mind\n the organs of sense are five viz\n ear skin eye and others\n the organs of action are five viz\n mouth hand leg and others\n pranas vital airs are five sound and other viz\n rudimentary principles are five\n manas buddhi chitta and ahankara are four thus those that know brahman know these to be the twenty four tattvas\n besides these the wise hold the quintuplicated elements to be five viz\n earth water fire vayu and akasa \n the bodies to be three viz\n the gross the subtle and the karana or causal the states of consciousness to be three viz\n the waking the dreaming and the dreamless sleeping\n the munis know the total collection of tattvas to be thirty six coupled with jiva \n with these tattvas there are six changes viz\n existence birth growth transformation decay and destruction\n hunger thirst grief delusion old age and death are said to be the six infirmities\n skin blood flesh fat marrow and bones are said to be the six sheaths\n passion anger avarice delusion pride and malice are the six kinds of foes\n vishva taijasa and prajna are the three aspects of the jiva\n sattva rajas and tamas are the three gunas qualities \n prarabdha sanchita and agamin are the three karmas\n talking lifting walking excreting and enjoying are the five actions of the organs of action \n and there are also yought certainty egoism compassion memory functions of manas etc\n complacency sympayour and indifference \n dik the quarters vayu sun varuna ashvini devas agni indra upendra and mrityu death and then the moon the four faced brahma rudra kshetrajna and ishvara\n thus these are the ninety six tattvas\n those that worship with devotion me of the form of boar who am other than the aggregate of these tattvas and am wiyout decay are released from ajnana and its effects and become jivanmuktas\n those that know these ninety six tattvas will attain salvation in whatever order of life they may be whether they have matted hair or are of shaven head or have only their tuft of hair on\n there is no doubt of this\n thus ends the first chapter of varaha upanishad\n chapter ii \n the great ribhu again addressed the lord of lakshmi of the form of boar thus o lord please initiate me into the supreme brahma vidya or science \n then the lord who removes the miseries of his devotees being thus questioned answered thus through the right observance of the duties of one s own caste and orders of life through religious austerities and through the pleasing of the guru by serving him rightly arise to persons the four vairagya etc\n they are the discrimination of the eternal from the non eternal indifference to the enjoyments of this and the other worlds the acquisition of the six virtues sama etc\n and the longing after liberation\n these should be pracit ised\n having subdued the sensual organs and having given up the conception of mine in all objects you should place your consciousness of i in or identify yourself with me who am the witness chaitanya consciousness \n to be born as a human being is difficult more difficult it is to be born as a male being and more so is it to be born as a brahmana\n even then if the fool does not cognise through the hearing etc\n of vedanta the true nature of the sachchidananda of brahman that is all pervading and that is beyond all caste and orders of life when will he obtain moksha i alone am happiness\n there is none other\n if there is said to be another then it is not happiness\n there is no such things as love except on my account\n the love that is on account of me is not natural to me\n as i am the seat of supreme love that i am not is not\n he who is sought after by all saying i should become such is myself the all pervading\n how can non light affect atman the self shining which is no other than the light whence originates the words i am not light \n my firm conviction is whoever knows for certain that atman which is self shining and has itself no basis to rest upon is one of vijnana\n the universe jiva ishvara maya and others do not really exist except my full atman\n i have not their characteristics karma which has dharana and other attributes and is of the form of darkness and ajnana is not fit to touch or affect me who am atman the self resplendent\n that man who sees his atman which is all witness and is beyond all caste and orders of life as of the nature of brahman becomes himself brahman\n whoever sees through the evidence of vedanta this visible universe as the supreme seat which is of the form of light attains moksha at once\n when that knowledge which dispels the idea that this body alone is atman arises firmly in one s mind as was before the knowledge that this body alone is atman then that person even yough he does not desire moksha gets it\n therefore how will a person be bound by karma who always enjoys the bliss of brahman which has the characteristics of sachchidananda and which is other than ajnana persons with spiritual eyes see brahman that is the witness of the three states that has the characteristics of be ness wisdom and bliss that is the underlying meaning of the words thou tvam and i aham and that is untouched by all the stains\n as a blind man does not see the sun that is shining so an ignorant person does not see brahman \n prajnana alone is brahman\n it has truth and prajnana as its characteristics\n by thus cognising brahman well a person becomes immortal\n one who knows his own atman as brahman that is bliss and wiyout duality and gunas qualities and that is truth and absolute consciousness is not afraid of anything\n that which is consciousness alone which is all pervading which is eternal which is all full which is of the form of bliss and which is indestructible is the only true brahman\n it is the settled determination of brahma jnanis that there is naught else but that\n as the world appears dark to the blind and bright to those having good eyes so this world full of manifold miseries to the ignorant is full of happiness to the wise\n in me of the form of boar who am infinite and the bliss of absolute consciousness if there is the conception of non dualism where then is bondage and who is the one to be emancipated the real nature of all embodied objects is ever the absolute consciousness\n like the pot seen by the eyes the body and its aggregates are not viz\n do not really exist \n knowing as atman all the locomotive and fixed worlds that appear as other than atman meditate upon them as it i am \n such a person then enjoys his real nature\n there is no other to be enjoyed than one self\n if there is anything that is then brahman alone has that attribute\n one who is perfect in brahmajnana yough he always sees this established universe does not see it other than his atman\n by cognising clearly my form one is not trammelled by karma\n he is an undaunted person who by his own experience cognises as his own real nature all the universe and brahman that is wiyout the body and the organs of sense that is the all witness that is the one noumenal vijnana that is the blissful atman as contrasted with jivatma or the lower self and that is the self resplendent\n he is one that should be known as i myself \n o ribhu may you become he\n after this there will be never any experience of the world\n thereafter there will always be the experience of the wisdom of one s own true nature\n one who has this known fully atman has neither emancipation nor bondage\n whoever meditates even for one muhurta minutes through the cognition of one s own real form upon him who is dancing as the all witness is released from all bondage\n prostrations prostrations to me who am in all the elements who am the chidatma viz\n atman of the nature of wisdom that is eternal and free and who am the pratyagatman\n o devata you are i\n prostrations on account of myself and yourself who are infinite and who are chidatma myself being the supreme isha lord and yourself being shiva of a beneficent nature \n what should i do where should i go what should i reject \n nothing because the universe is filled by me as with the waters on the universal deluge\n whoever gives up fondness love of the external love of the internal and love of the body and thus gives up all associations is merged in me\n there is no doubt about it\n that paramahamsa ascetic who yough living in the world keeps aloof from human congregation as from serpent who regards a beautiful woman as a living corpse and the endless sensual objects as poison and who has abandoned all passion and is indifferent towards all objects is no other than vasudeva viz\n this is satya truth \n this is nothing but truth\n it is truth alone that is now said\n i am brahman the truth\n there is naught else but i\n the word upavasa lit\n dwelling near signifies the dwelling near or union of jivatma and paramatman and not the religious observance as accepted by the worldly of emaciating the body through fasts\n to the ignorant what is the use of the mere drying up of the body by beating about the hole of a snake can we be said to have killed the big snake within\n a man is said to attain paroksha indirect wisdom when he knows theoretically that there is brahman but he is said to attain sakshatkara direct cognition when he knows or realises that he is himself brahman\n when a yogin knows his atman to be the absolute then he becomes a jivanmukta\n to mahatmas to be always in the state i am brahman conduces to their salvation\n there are two words for bondage and moksha\n they are mine and not mine \n man is bound by mine but he is released by not mine \n he should abandon all the youghts relating to externals and so also with references to internals\n o ribhu having given up all youghts you should rest content in your atman ever\n the whole of the universe is caused through sankalpa alone\n it is only through sankalpa that the universe manifests\n having abandoned the universe which is of the form of sankalpa and having fixed your mind upon the nirvikalpa one which is changeless meditate upon my abode in your heart\n o most intelligent being pass your time in meditating upon me glorifying me in songs talking about me to one another and thus devoting yourself entirely to me as the supreme\n whatever is chit consciousness in the universe is only chinmatra\n this universe is chinmaya only\n i am chit contemplate upon the worlds also as chit\n make the desires nil\n always be wiyout any stain\n how then can the bright lamp of atmic vijnana arising through the vedas be affected by the karma arising from the ignorance of the actor and the agent having given up not atman and being in the world unaffected by it delight only in the chinmatra within ever intent on the one\n as the akasa of the pot and that of the house are both located in the all pervading akasa so the jivas and ishvara are only evolved out of me the chidakasa the one akasa of universal consciousness \n so that which did not exist before the evolution of atmas jiva and ishvara and that which is rejected at the end viz\n universal deluge is called maya by brahma jnanis through their discrimination\n should maya and its effects the universe be annihilated there is no state of ishvara there is no state of jiva\n therefore like the akasa wiyout its vehicle i am the immaculate and chit\n the creation sentient as well as non sentient from ikshana thinking to pravesha entry of those having the forms of jivas and ishvara is due to the creation or illusion of ishvara while the samsara worldly existence from the waking state to salvation is due to the creation of jiva\n so the karmas ordained in the sacrifice called trinachaka so called after nachiketas of katha upanishad to yoga are dependent upon the illusion of ishvara while the systems from lokayata atheistical system to sankhya rest on the illusion of jiva\n therefore aspirants after salvation should never make their heads enter into the field of controversy regarding jiva and ishvara\n but with an undisturbed mind tattvas of brahman should be investigated\n those who do not cognise the tattva of the secondless brahman are all deluded persons only\n whence then is salvation to them whence then is happiness to them in this universe \n what if they have the youghts of the superiority and inferiority of ishvara and jiva will sovereignty and mendicancy experienced by a person in the dreaming state affect him in his waking state \n when buddhi is absorbed in ajnana then it is termed by the wise sleep\n whence then is sleep to me who have not ajnana and its effects \n when buddhi is in full bloom then it is said to be the jagrat waking state \n as i have no changes etc\n there is no waking state to me\n the moving about of buddhi in the subtle nadis constitutes the dreaming state\n in me wiyout the act of moving about there is no dreaming\n then at the time of sushupti when all things are absorbed enveloped by tamas he then enjoys the highest bliss of his own nature in an invisible state\n if he sees everything as chit wiyout any difference he alone is an actual vijnani\n he alone is shiva\n he alone is hari\n he alone is brahma\n this mundane existence which is an ocean of sorrow is nothing but a long lived dream or an illusion of the mind or a long lived reign of the mind\n from rising from sleep till going to bed the one brahman alone should be contemplated upon\n by causing to be absorbed this universe which is but a superimposition the chitta partakes of my nature\n having annihilated all the six powerful enemies through their destruction become the non dual one like the scent elephant\n whether the body perishes now or lasts the age of moon and stars what matters it to me having chit alone as my body what matters it to the akasa in the pot whether it the pot is destroyed now or exists for a long time\n while the slough of a serpent lies cast off lifeless in its hole it the serpent does not evince any affection towards it\n likewise the wise do not identify themselves with their gross and subtle bodies\n if the delusive knowledge that the universe is real with its cause should be destroyed by the fire of atma jnana the wise man becomes bodiless through the idea it brahman is not this it is not this \n shastras the knowledge of reality of the universe perishes\n through direct perception of truth one s fitness for action in this universe ceases\n with the cessation of prarabdha the portion of the past karma which is being enjoyed in this life the destruction of the manifestation of the universe takes place\n maya is thus destroyed in a three fold manner\n if within himself no identification of jiva with brahman takes place the state of the separateness of jiva does not perish\n if the non dual one is truly discerned then all affinities for objects cease\n with the cessation of prarabdha arising from the cessation of affinities there is that of the body\n therefore it is certain that maya perishes thus entirely\n if it is said that all the universe is that brahman alone is that is of the nature of sat\n if it is said that the universe shines then it is brahman alone that shines\n the mirage of all the water in an oasis is really no other than the oasis itself\n through inquiry of one s self the three worlds above below and middle are only of the nature of chit\n in brahman which is one and alone the essence of whose nature is absolute consciousness and which is remote from the differences of jiva ishvara and guru there is no ajnana\n such being the case where then is the occasion for the universe there i am that brahman which is all full\n while the full moon of wisdom is robbed of its lustre by the rahu one of the two nodes of the moon of delusion all actions such as the rites of bathing alms giving and sacrifice performed during the time of eclipse are all fruitless\n as salt dissolved in water becomes one so if atman and manas become identified it is termed samadhi\n wiyout the grace of a good perfect guru the abandonment of sensual objects is very difficult of attainment so also the perception of divine truth and the attainment of one s true state\n then the state of being in one s own self shines of its own accord in a yogin in whom jnana sakti has dawned and who has abandoned all karmas\n the property of fluctuation is natural to mercury and mind\n if either mercury is bound or consolidated or mind is bound or controlled what then on this earth cannot be accomplished \n he who obtains murchchha cures all diseases\n the dead are brought to life again\n he who has bound his mind or mercury is able to move in the air\n therefore mercury and mind confer upon one the state of brahman\n the master of indriyas the organs is manas mind \n the master of manas is prana\n the master of prana is laya absorption yoga \n therefore laya yoga should be pracit ised\n to the yogins laya yoga is said to be wiyout actions and changes\n this laya absorption of mind which is above speech and in which one has to abandon all sankalpas and to give up completely all actions should be known through one s own experience \n as an actress yough subject or dancing in harmony to music cymbals and other musical instruments of time has her mind intent upon he protection of the pot on her head so the yogin yough intent for the time being upon the hosts of objects never leaves off the mind contemplating on brahman\n the person who desires all the wealth of yoga should after having given up all youghts pracit ise with a subdued mind concentration on nada spiritual sound alone\n thus ends the second chapter of varaha upanishad\n chapter iii \n the one principle cannot at any time become of manifold forms\n as i am the partless there is none else but myself\n whatever is seen and whatever is heard is no other than brahman\n i am that para brahman which is the eternal the immaculate the free the one the undivided bliss the non dual the truth the wisdom and the endless\n i am of the nature of bliss i am of undivided wisdom i am the supreme of the supreme i am the resplendent absolute consciousness\n as the clouds do not touch the akasa so the miseries attendant on mundane existence do not affect me\n know all to be happiness through the annihilation of sorrow and all to be of the nature of sat beness through the annihilation of asat not be ness \n it is only the nature of chit consciousness that is associated with this visible universe\n therefore my form is partless\n to an exalted yogin there is neither birth nor death nor going to other spheres nor returning to earth there is no stain or purity or knowledge but the universe shines to him as absolute consciousness\n pracit ise always silence i am viz\n that you yourself are para brahman which is truth and absolute consciousness which is undivided and non dual which is invisible which is stainless which is pure which is second less and which is beneficent\n it brahman is not subject to birth and death happiness and misery\n it is not subject to caste law family and gotra clan \n pracit ise silence i am chit which is the vivarta upadana viz\n the illusory cause of the universe\n always pracit ise silence i am viz\n you are the brahman that is the full the secondless the undivided consciousness which has neither the relationship nor the differences existing in the universe and which partakes of the essence of the non dual and the supreme sat and chit\n that which always is and that which preserves the same nature during the three periods of time unaffected by anything is my eternal form of sat\n even the state of happiness which is eternal wiyout upadhis vehicles and which is superior to all the happiness derivable from sushupti is of my bliss only\n as by the rays of the sun thick gloom is soon destroyed so darkness the cause of rebirth is destroyed by hari vishnu viz\n the sun s lustre\n through the contemplation and worship of my hari s feet every person is delivered from his ignorance\n the means of destroying deaths and births is only through the contemplation of my feet\n as a lover of wealth praises a wealyour man so if with earnestness a person praises the cause of the universe who will not be delivered from bondage \n as in the presence of the sun the world of its own accord begins to perform its actions so in my presence all the worlds are animated to action\n as to the mother of pearl the illusory conception of silver is falsely attributed so to me is falsely attributed through maya this universe which is composed of mahat etc\n i am not with those differences that are observable in the body of low caste men the body of cow etc\n the fixed one s the bodies of brahmanas and others\n as to a person even after being relieved from the misconception of the directions the same misconception of direction continues as before just so is to me the universe yough destroyed by vijnana\n therefore the universe is not\n i am neither the body nor the organs of sense and action nor pranas nor manas nor buddhi nor ahankara nor chitta nor maya nor the universe including akasa and others\n neither am i the actor the enjoyer nor he who causes the enjoyment\n i am brahman that is chit sat and ananda alone and that is janardana vishnu \n as through the fluctuation of water the sun reflected therein is moved so atman arises in this mundane existence through its mere connection with ahankara\n this mundane existence has chitta as its root\n this chitta should be cleansed by repeated effort\n how is it you have your confidence in the greatness of chitta \n alas where is all the wealth of the kings where are the brahmanas where are all the worlds all old ones are gone\n many fresh evolutions have occurred\n many crores of brahmas have passed away\n many kings have flitted away like particles of dust\n even to a jnani the love of the body may arise through the asura demoniacal nature\n if the asura nature should arise in a wise man his knowledge of truth becomes fruitless\n should rajas and others generated in us be burnt by the fire of discriminative divine wisdom how can they germinate again \n just as a very intelligent person delights in the shortcomings of another so if one finds out his own faults and corrects them who will not be relieved from bondage \n o lord of munis only he who has not atma jnana and who is not an emancipated person longs after siddhis\n he attains such siddhis through medicine or wealth mantras religious works time and skill\n in the eyes of an atma jnani these siddhis are of no importance\n one who has become an atmajnani one who has his sight solely on atman and one who is content with atman the higher self through his atman or the lower self never follows the dictates of avidya\n whatever exists in this world he knows to be of the nature of avidya\n how then will an atma jnani who has relinquished avidya be immersed in or affected by it\n though medicine mantras religious work time and skill or mystical expressions lead to the development of siddhis yet they cannot in any way help one to attain the seat of paramatman\n how then can one who is an atma jnani and who is wiyout his mind be said to long after siddhis while all the actions of his desires are controlled thus ends the third chapter of varaha upanishad\n chapter iv on another occasion nidagha asked lord ribhu to enlighten him as to the characteristics of jivanmukti\n to which ribhu replied in the affirmative and said the following in the seven bhumikas or stages of development of wisdom there are four kinds of jivanmuktas\n of these the first stage is subhechcha good desire the second is vicharana inquiry the third is tanumanasi or pertaining to the thinned mind the fourth is sattvapatti the attainment of sattva the fifth is asamsakti nonattachment the sixth is the padartha bhavana analysis of objects and the seventh is the turya fourth or final stage \n the bhumika which is of the form of pranava om is formed of or is divided into akara a ukara u makara m and ardha matra\n akara and others are of four kinds on account of the difference of sthula gross sukshma subtle bija seed or causal and sakshi witness \n their avasthas are four waking dreaming dreamless sleeping and turya fourth \n he who is in or the entity that identifies itself with the waking state in the gross amsa essence or part of akara is named vishva in the subtle essence he is termed taijasa in the bija essence he is termed prajna and in the sakshi essence he is termed turya\n he who is in the dreaming state or the entity which identifies itself with the dreaming state in the gross essence of ukara is vishva in the subtle essence he is termed taijasa in the bija essence is termed prajna and in the sakshi essence he is termed turya\n he who is in the sushupti state in the gross essence of makara is termed vishva in the subtle essence taijasa in the bija essence he is termed prajna and in the sakshi essence he is termed turya\n he who is in turya state in the gross essence of ardha matra is termed turya vishva\n in the subtle he is termed taijasa in the bija essence he is termed prajna and in the sakshi essence he is termed turya turya\n the turya essence of akara is or embraces the first second and third bhumikas or stages of the seven \n the turya essence of ukara embraces the fourth bhumika\n the turya essence of makara embraces the fifth bhumika\n the turya essence of ardha matra is the sixth stage\n beyond this is the seventh stage\n one who functions in the first three bhumikas is called mumukshu one who functions in the fourth bhumika is called a brahmavit one who functions in the fifth bhumika is called a brahmavidvara one who functions in the sixth bhumika is called a brahmavidvariya and one in the seventh bhumika is called a brahmavidvarishtha\n with reference to this there are slokas\n subhechcha is said to be the first jnana bhumi or stage of wisdom vicharana the second tanumanasi the third \n sattvapatti the fourth then come asamsakti as the fifth padartha bhavana as the sixth and turya as the seventh\n the desire that arise in one through sheer vairagya after resolving shall i be ignorant i will be seen by the shastras and the wise or i will study the books and be with the wise is termed by the wise as subhechcha\n the association with the wise and shastras and the following of the right path preceding the practice of indifference is termed vicharana\n that stage wherein the hankering after sensual objects is thinned through the first and second stages is said to be tanumanasi\n that stage wherein having become indifferent to all sensual objects through the exercise in the above three stages the purified chitta rests on atman which is of the nature of sat is called sattvapatti\n the light or manifestation of sattva guna that is firmly rooted in one wiyout any desire for the fruits of actions through the practice in the above four stages is termed asamsakti\n that stage wherein through the practice in the above five stages one having found delight in atman has no conception of the internals or externals yough before him and engages in actions only when impelled to do so by others is termed padartha bhavana the sixth stage\n the stage wherein after exceedingly long practice in the above six stages one is immovably fixed in the contemplation of atman alone wiyout the difference of the universe is the seventh stage called turya\n the three stages beginning with subhechcha are said to be attained with or amidst differences and non differences\n because the universe one sees in the waking state he thinks to be really existent\n when the mind is firmly fixed on the non dual one and the conception of duality is put down then he sees this universe as a dream through his union with the fourth stage\n as the autumnal cloud being dispersed vanishes so this universe perishes\n o nidagha be convinced that such a person has only sattva remaining\n then having ascended the fifth stage called sushuptipada dreamless sleeping seat he remains simply in the non dual state being freed from all the various differences\n having always introvision yough ever participating in external actions those that are engaged in the practice of this sixth stage are seen like one sleeping when fatigued viz\n being freed from all affinities \n lastly the seventh stage which is the ancient and which is called gudhasupti is generally attained\n then one remains in that secondless state wiyout fear and with his consciousness almost annihilated where there is neither sat nor asat neither self nor not self\n like an empty pot in the akasa there is void both within and wiyout like a filled vessel in the midst of an ocean he is full both within and wiyout\n do not become either the knower or the known\n may you become the reality which remains after all youghts are given up\n having discarded all the distinctions of the seer the sight and the seen with their affinities meditate solely upon atman which shines as the supreme light\n he is said to be a jivanmukta emancipated person in whom yough participating in the material concerns of the world the universe is not seen to exist like the invisible akasa\n he is said to be a jivanmukta the light of whose mind never sets or rises in misery or happiness and who does not seek to change what happens to him viz\n either to diminish his misery or increase his happiness \n he is said to be a jivanmukta who yough in his sushupti is awake and to whom the waking state is unknown and whose wisdom is free from the affinities of objects \n he is said to be a jivanmukta whose heart is pure like akasa yough acting as it in consonance to love hatred fear and others\n he is said to be a jivanmukta who has not the conception of his being the actor and whose buddhi is not attached to material objects whether he performs actions or not\n he is said to be a jivanmukta of whom people are not afraid who is not afraid of people and who has given up joy anger and fear\n he is said to be a jivanmukta who yough participating in all the illusory objects is cool amidst them and is a full atman being as if they belonged to others\n o muni he is said to be a jivanmukta who having eradicated all the desires of his chitta is fully content with me who am the atman of all\n he is said to be a jivanmukta who rests with an unshaken mind in that all pure abode which is chinmatra and free from all the modifications of chitta\n he is said to be a jivanmukta in whose chitta do not dawn the distinctions of the universe i he you and others that are visible and unreal\n through the path of the guru and shastras enter soon sat the brahman that is immutable great full and wiyout objects and be firmly seated there\n shiva alone is guru shiva alone is vedas shiva alone is lord shiva alone is i shiva alone is all\n there is none other than shiva\n the undaunted brahmana having known him shiva should attain wisdom\n one need not utter many words as they but injure the organ of speech\n the rishi suka is a mukta emancipated person \n the rishi vamadeva is a mukta\n there are no others who have attained emancipation than through these viz\n the two paths of these two rishis \n those brave men who follow the path of suka in this world become sadyo muktas viz\n emancipated immediately after the body wear away \n while those who always follow the path of vamadeva i\n vedanta in this world are subject again and again to rebirths and attain krama gradual emancipation through yoga sankhya and karmas associated with sattva guna \n thus there are two paths laid down by the lord of devas viz\n the suka and vamadeva paths\n the suka path is called the bird s path while the vamadeva path is called the ant s path\n those persons that have cognised the true nature of their atman through the mandatory and prohibitory injunctions of the vedas the inquiry into the true meaning of mahavakyas the sacred sentences of the vedas the samadhi of sankhya yoga or asamprajnata samadhi and that have thereby purified themselves attain the supreme seat through the suka path\n having through hatha yoga practice with the pain caused by yama postures etc\n become liable to the ever recurring obstacles caused by anima and other siddhis and having not obtained good results one is born again in a great family and pracit ises yoga through his previous karmic affinities\n then through the practice of yoga during many lives he attains salvation viz\n the supreme seat of vishnu through the vamadeva path\n thus there are two paths that lead to the attainment of brahman and that are beneficent\n the one confers instantaneous salvation and the other confers gradual salvation\n to one that sees all as the one brahman where is delusion where is sorrow \n those that are under the eyes of those whose buddhi is solely occupied with the truth of brahman that is the end of all experience are released from all heinous sins\n all beings inhabiting heaven and earth that fall under the vision of brahmavits are at once emancipated from the sins committed during many crores of births\n thus ends the fourth chapter of varaha upanishad\n chapter v then nidagha asked lord ribhu to enlighten him as to the rules to be observed in the practice of yoga\n accordingly he the lord said thus \n the body is composed of the five elements\n it is filled with five mandalas spheres \n that which is hard is prithvi earth one of them that which is liquid is apas \n that which is bright is tejas fire motion is the property of vayu that which pervades everywhere is akasa\n all these should be known by an aspirant after yoga\n through the blowing of vayu mandala in this body there are caused breaths every day and night\n if there is a diminution in the prithvi mandala there arise folds in the body if there is diminution in the essence of apas there arises gradually greyness of hair \n if there is diminution in the essence of tejas there is loss of hunger and lustre if there is diminution in the essence of vayu there is incessant tremor \n if there is diminution in the essence of akasa one dies\n the jivita viz\n prana which possesses these elements having no place to rest in the body owing to the diminution of the elements rises up like birds flying up in the air\n it is for this reason that is called udyana lit\n with reference to this there is said to be a bandha binding also meaning a posture called udyana bandha by which this flight can be arrested \n this udyana bandha is to or does away with death as a lion to an elephant\n its experience is in the body as also the bandha\n its binding in the body is hurtful\n if there is agitation of agni fire within the belly then there will be caused much of pain\n therefore this udyana bandha should not be pracit ised by one who is hungry or who has urgency to make water or void excrement\n he should take many times in small quantities proper and moderate food\n he should pracit ise mantra yoga\n laya yoga and hatha yoga through mild middling and transcendental methods or periods respectively\n laya mantra and hatha yogas have each the same eight subservients\n they are yama niyama asana pranayama pratyahara dharana dhyana and samadhi\n of these yama is of ten kinds\n they are non injury truth non coveting continence compassion straightforwardness patience courage moderate eating and purity bodily and mental \n niyama is of ten kinds\n they are tapas religious austerities contentment belief in the existence of god or vedas charity worship of ishvara or god listening to the expositions of religious doctrines modesty a good intellect japa muttering of prayers and vrata religious observances \n they are eleven postures beginning with chakra\n chakra padma kurma mayura kukkuta vira svastika bhadra simha mukta and gomukha are the postures enumerated by the knowers of yoga\n placing the left ankle on the right thigh and the right ankle on the left thigh and keeping the body erect while sitting is the posture chakra \n pranayama should be pracit ised again and again in the following order viz\n inspiration restraint of breath and expiration\n the pranayama is done through the nadis nerves \n hence it is called the nadis themselves\n the body of every sentient being is ninety six digits long\n in the middle of the body two digits above the anus and two digits below the sexual organ is the centre of the body called muladhara or sacral plexus \n nine digits above the genitals there is kanda of nadis which revolves oval shaped four digits high and four digits broad\n it is surrounded by fat flesh bone and blood\n in it is situate a nadi chakra wheel of nerves having twelve spokes\n kundali by which this body is supported is there\n it is covering by its face the brahmarandhra viz\n brahma s hole of susumna\n by the side of susumna dwell the nadis alambusa and kuhuh\n in the next two spokes are varuna and yasasvini\n on the spoke south of susumna is in regular course pingala\n on the next two spokes are pusha and payasvini\n on the spoke west of susumna is the nadi called sarasvati\n on the next two spokes are sankhini and gandhari\n to the north of susumna dwells ida in the next is hastijihva in the next is visvodara\n in these spokes of the wheel the twelve nadis carry the twelve vayus from left to right to the different parts of the body \n the nadis are like i\n woven like the warp and woof of cloth\n they are said to have different colours\n the central portion of the cloth here the collection of the nadis is called the nabhi chakra navel plexus \n jvalanti nadarupini pararandhra and susumna are called the basic supports of nada spiritual sound \n these four nadis are of ruby colour\n the central portion of brahmarandhra is again and again covered by kundali\n thus ten vayus move in these nadis\n a wise man who has understood the course of nadis and vayus should after keeping his neck and body erect with his mouth closed contemplate immovably upon turyaka atman at the tip of his nose in the centre of his heart and in the middle of bindu and should see with a tranquil mind through the mental eyes the nectar flowing from there\n having closed the anus and drawn up the vayu and caused it to rise through the repetition of pranava om he should complete with sri bija\n he should contemplate upon his atman as sri or parasakti and as being bathed by nectar\n this is kalavanchana lit\n it is said to be the most important of all\n whatever is yought of by the mind is accomplished by the mind itself\n then agni fire will flame in jala water and in the flame of agni will arise the branches and blossoms\n then the words uttered and the actions done regarding the universe are not in vain\n by checking the bindu in the path by making the fire flame up in the water and by causing the water to dry up the body is made firm\n having contracted simultaneously the anus and yoni the womb united together he should draw up apana and unite with it samana\n he should contemplate upon his atman as shiva and then as being bathed by nectar\n in the central part of each spoke the yogin should commence to concentrate bala will or strength \n he should try to go up by the union of prana and apana\n this most important yoga brightens up in the body the path of siddhis\n as dam across the water serves as an obstacle to the floods so it should ever be known by the yogins that the chhaya of the body is to jiva \n this bandha is said of all nadis\n through the grace of this bandha the devata goddess becomes visible\n this bandha of four feet serves as a check to the three paths\n this brightens up the path through which the siddhas obtained their siddhis \n if with prana is made to rise up soon udana this bandha checking all nadis goes up\n this is called samputa yoga or mula bandha\n through the pracit ising of this yoga the three bandhas are mastered\n by pracit ising day and night intermittingly or at any convenient time the vayu will come under his control\n with the control of vayu agni the gastric fire in the body will increase daily\n with the increase of agni food etc\n will be easily digested\n should food be properly digested there is increase of rasa essence of food \n with the daily increase of rasa there is the increase of dhatus spiritual substances \n with the increase of dhatus there is the increase of wisdom in the body\n thus all the sins collected together during many crores of births are burnt up\n in the centre of the anus and the genitals there is the triangular muladhara\n it illumines the seat of shiva of the form of bindu\n there is located the parasakti named kundalini\n from that seat vayu arises\n from that seat agni becomes increased\n from that seat bindu originates and nada becomes increased\n from that seat hamsa is born\n from that seat manas is born\n the six chakras beginning with muladhara are said to be the seat of sakti goddess \n from the neck to the top of the head is said to be the seat of sambhu shiva \n to the nadis the body is the support or vehicle to prana the nadis are the support to jiva prana is the dwelling place to hamsa jiva is the support \n to sakti hamsa is the seat and the locomotive and fixed universe\n being wiyout distraction and of a calm mind one should pracit ise pranayama\n even a person who is well skilled in the practice of the three bandhas should try always to cognise with a true heart that principle which should be known and is the cause of all objects and their attributes\n both expiration and inspiration should be stopped and made to rest in restraint of breath alone \n he should depend solely on brahman which is the highest aim of all visibles\n the giving out of all external objects is said to be rechaka expiration \n the taking in of the spiritual knowledge of the shastras is said to be puraka inspiration and the keeping to oneself of such knowledge is said to be kumbhaka or restraint of breath \n he is an emancipated person who pracit ises thus such a chitta\n there is no doubt about it\n through kumbhaka it the mind should be always taken up and through kumbhaka alone it should be filled up within\n it is only through kumbhaka that kumbhaka should be firmly mastered\n within it is parama shiva\n that vayu which is non motionless should be shaken again through kantha mudra throat posture \n having checked the course of vayu having become perfect in the practice of expiration and restraint of breath and having planted evenly on the ground the two hands and the two feet one should pierce the four seats through vayu through the three yogas\n he should shake mahameru with the aid of prakoit is forces at the mouth of vayu\n the two putas cavities being drawn vayu throbs quickly\n the union of moon sun and agni should be known on account of nectar\n through the motion of meru the devatas who stay in the centre of meru move\n at first in his brahma granthi there is produced soon a hole or passage \n then having pierced brahma granthi he pierces vishnu granthi then he pierces rudra granthi\n then to the yogin comes vedha piercing through his liberation from the impurities of delusion through the religious ceremonies performed in various births through the grace of gurus and devatas and through the practice of yoga\n in the mandala sphere or region of susumna situated between ida and pingala vayu should be made to rise up through the feature known as mudra bandha\n the short pronunciation of pranava frees one from sins its long pronunciation confers on one moksha\n so also its pronunciation in apyayana or pluta svara tone \n he is a knower of veda who through the above mentioned three ways of pronunciation knows the end of pranava which is beyond the power of speech like the never ceasing flow of oil or the long drawn bell sound\nthe short svara goes to bindu\n the long svara goes to brahmarandhra the pluta to dvadasanta twelfth centre \n the mantras should be uttered on account of getting mantra siddhis\n this pranava om will remove all obstacles\n it will remove all sins\n of this are four bhumikas states predicated viz\n arambha ghata parichaya and nishpatti\n arambha is that state in which one having abandoned external karmas performed by the three organs mind speech and body is always engaged in mental karma only\n it is said by the wise that the ghata state is that in which vayu having forced an opening on the western side and being full is firmly fixed there\n parichaya state is that in which vayu is firmly fixed to akasa neither associated with jiva nor not while the body is immovable\n it is said that nishpatti state is that in which there take place creation and dissolution through atman or that state in which a yogin having become a jivanmukta performs yoga wiyout effort\n whoever recites this upanishad becomes immaculate like agni\n like vayu he becomes pure\n he becomes freed from the sin of drinking alcohol\n he becomes freed from the sins of the theft of gold\n he becomes a jivanmukta\n this is what is said by the rig veda\n like the eye pervading the akasa seeing wiyout effort everything above a wise man sees always the supreme seat of vishnu\n the brahmanas who have always their spiritual eyes wide open praise and illuminate in diverse ways the spiritual seat of vishnu\n om thus is the upanishad\n thus ends the fifth chapter of varaha upanishad\n om may he protect us both together may he nourish us both together may we work conjointly with great energy may our study be vigorous and effective may we not mutually dispute or may we not hate any \n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the varaha upanishad belonging to the krishna yajur veda",
    "Satyayani": "om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me \n the mind alone is the cause of bondage and liberation of the people the mind attached to the objects of the senses leads them to bondage freed from the objects it leads them to liberation\n thus it has been declared\n if that attachment of the mind of a person to the objects of the senses is directed towards brahman who shall not be liberated from bondage \n the mind chitta alone is worldly life hence it should be purified with effort\n as the mind is so he becomes\n this is the eternal secret\n one who knows not the veda realizes not that omnipresent one brahman one who knows not brahman reaches not that supreme abode\n he who realizes that the omnipresent god vishnu the omniscient one the prop of all vasudeva is himself that sage seer of reality attains the state of wisdom while living vipratvam \n then observing in the four disciplines those brahmanas well versed in the veda and untouched by desires who ponder over the eternal supreme brahman realize brahman \n a person desiring liberation who is quiescent self subdued has renounced all sensory pleasures is forbearing well versed in the scripture is known as equanimous has discarded the primary desires for wealth wife and progeny and is free from the debts to the manes etc\n coming to realize the atman shall live observing silence in some stage of life or other as the kutichaka or paramahamsa \n then entering into the final stage of life i\n sannyasa he may possess five small things matras as is proper\n he should possess as long as he lives the five things namely a three fold staff of bamboo sacred thread garment consisting of a loin cloth sling and holy ring of sacred grass\n these fire are the things pertaining to an ascetic of the kutichaka order to all ascetics the inward possessions are five namely the a u m the bindu and the nada constituting om\n this matra namely the five constituents is heard in the pranava brahman \n till the final exit of the vital breath the ascetic shall not abandon the twofold five matras even at death the five external matras shall be buried with him\n the sign of vishnu i\n means leading to liberation is said to be twofold the external and the internal\n if one of them is discarded the ascetic is wiyout doubt fallen\n the threefold staff is an emblem leading to vishnu it is a means of attaining liberation by learned brahmanas as ascetics\n it is the extinction of all worldly characteristics thus runs the vedic teaching\n then indeed oh brahmana there are four kinds of ascetics namely kutichaka bahudaka hamsa and paramahamsa\n all these bear the signs of vishnu i\n they strive for liberation wear tuft and sacred thread are pure in mind consider their own self as brahman are intent on worship of god in the form of pure consciousness pracit ise muttering of prayers and the principal and secondary disciplines yama and niyama are of good conduct and thus become exalted\n this is declared in a vedic verse the kutichaka bahudaka hamsa and paramahamsa ascetics are different in their way of life all these possess the signs of vishnu the external and internal which are always visible and invisible respectively \n pracit ising the five devotional acts yajnas having penetration into the vedanta observing the rites appropriate to the station in life resorting to the spiritual lore abandoning the tree of worldly life but having recourse to its root cause namely brahman renouncing its flowers of rituals but enjoying its true essence sporting in vishnu i\n leading the life spiritual delighting in vishnu freed from external worship identifying themselves with vishnu they realize the omnipresent vishnu\n worship during the three junctures of the day sandhyas bathing according to capacity presenting libations of water to the manes cleansing i\n purifying oneself with water waiting upon the deities with prayers these five devotional acts the kutichaka shall perform till death\n with ten pranavas and seven mystic words vyahriit is the four footed gayatri along with its head is the prayer to be recited during the three sandhyas\n the practice of yoga consists of the constant single minded devoted service of vishnu the guru non injuring by word yought and deed is the devotional act of penance tapoyajna \n it is declared that the devotional act of studying the scripture svadhyaya yajna consists of reciting the various upanishads\n the attentive reciting of om offers the concept of the individual self in the fire of the non dual brahman\n the devotional act of possessing spiritual wisdom jnana yajna is to be known as the very best of all yajnas\n the paramahamsas have jnana true knowledge for the emblematic staff jnana for the tuft and jnana for the sacred thread\n he whose tuft consists of jnana and the sacred thread too of that jnana has all the characteristics of a brahmana thus is the injunction of the veda\n then indeed oh brahmana these mendicant monks are as they appear i\n unclad as when they were born \n they should desire to remain as a tree having gone beyond passion anger greed delusion false pride pride envy mine ness and egoit ism and having discarded honour and dishonour blame and praise and when cut down like a tree they shall not complain\n thus these wise men become immortal here in this world itself\n this has been said in the vedic verse having taken leave of his kinsmen and son with good will and not seeing them again enduring the pairs of opposites heat and cold etc\n and quiescent he shall turn eastward or northward and proceed on foot\n equipped with a water vessel and staff seeing four cubits of ground alone before him wearing sacred thread and tuft or remaining shaven headed having a family of his body alone and receiving from people alms unbegged or begged for bare sustenance having a vessel made of clay wood gourd or strung leaves as originally provided and clothed with a garment of hemp silk grass a patched one deer skin or a leafy one strung or unstrung shaving his head alone at the junction of the seasons wiyout removing hair below and in the arm pits and never the tuft he shall reside in a fixed place for four months of the rainy season during which the inward soul the omnipresent purusha vishnu is asleep in the milky ocean \n when god vishnu has risen from sleep the ascetic may reside in one place to carry out his work such as study meditation or samadhi for the other eight months or he may go about as a mendicant monk \n during the journey he may stay for short periods in a temple a hut where the ritual fire is kept the shade of a tree or a cave wiyout attachment and unnoticed by the people\n he shall be quiescent like fire when fuel is exhausted and he shall not give or cause trouble to any one anywhere\n on seeing one equal to or inferior to him he shall not shrink nor consider any one existing as different from himself \n if a person has realized that he is the atman non different from the universal self what can he wish for and to fulfil which desire need he torture his body by various kinds of austerities \n a wise man knowing this truth and thus a knower of brahman shall have this consciousness\n he shall not worry himself with many words for it is only torturing language\n having discerned the knowledge of brahman he should wish to remain with dispassion lit\n with the innocence of the child a sage has realized the atman when he has the lore of brahman and dispassion\n when all desires which cling to the heart have been shed then the man becomes immortal and he enjoys the bliss of brahman here itself \n then indeed oh brahman he who abandons this asceticism which is the highest spiritual life becomes a child murderer a murderer of a brahmana a killer of an embryo a great sinner\n he who abandons this steady life pertaining to vishnu i\n the external and internal discipline in spiritual life becomes a thief a seducer of his preceptor s wife treacherous to a friend ungrateful he is denied all auspicious worlds\n this has been declared in the vedic verse a thief a drinker of spirituous liquor a seducer of his preceptor s wife and one treacherous to his friend get purified by expiation but one who abandons the sign of vishnu external or internal which he was possessing will never be purified in spite of all his self exertions\n abandoning the sign of vishnu worship external or internal he who resorts to his stage of life or no prescribed stage at all or returns to his former way of living prior to renunciation to that great fool and to people of his kind there is no liberation seen even in tens of millions of eons\n abandoning all other stages of life a wise man should live for long in the stage of life leading to liberation\n there is no liberation possible to one who has fallen from the stage leading to final beatitude\n having embraced asceticism if one does not remain observing its laws he is to be known as fallen from grace arudhachyuta such is the vedic injunction\n then indeed oh brahmana when a wise man has embraced this age old spiritual life pertaining to vishnu and remains wiyout transgressing it he becomes self controlled woryour of being remembered as auspicious a true knower of the world a knower of the vedanta a knower of brahman omniscient self luminous he becomes the supreme god brahman he redeems from the misery of worldly life his ancestors relations by marriage other kinsmen associates and friends\n when a wise man renounces the world those belonging to his family become blessed in this world a hundred generations before him and three hundred generations after him\n the scripture says that a very pious mendicant monk redeems thirty generations of his family after him thirty generations before him and thirty generations after those that follow the first thirty \n the vedic teaching is that the ancestors of a wise man are redeemed if he were to say that he has renounced even while his final breath remains in his throat i\n hence oh brahmana wise men have said that this age old lore of the self the discipline pertaining to vishnu shall not be expounded till one has oneself realized the goal and that not to one who has not studied the veda has not the conviction of the self has not freed himself from attachment has not become pure has not approached to receive this of his own accord and who has not made earnest efforts to know them \n this has been said in a vedic verse as well once brahma vidya approached the god brahma and said guard me i am your treasure\n do not reveal me to one who is envious crooked or crafty\n thus shall i be of potent strength \n this discipline of the atman pertaining to vishnu i\n this lore to realize brahman shall be revealed to a person after a careful test as to whether he is of pure conduct attentive intelligent observes celibacy and has approached the guru of his own accord for receiving instruction \n with those ascetics who have been taught the scripture by a guru and who do not honour him in word yought and deed the guru does not dine similarly good ascetics do not eat the food from houses where the ill mannered receive alms \n such is the injunction of the scripture\n the guru is the supreme righteousness dharma the guru alone is the sole means of liberation \n he who honours not his guru who gives initiation into the single syllable om which is brahman has all his scriptural learning penance and spiritual wisdom oozed out as water from an unbaked clay vessel\n he who has supreme faith in god and the same faith in his guru is a knower of brahman who reaches supreme beatitude\n such is the teaching of the veda\n thus ends the upanishad\n om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here

gems together with sita bharata lakshmana and satrughna was rama seated glorified day and night by sages like sanaka vasistha and suka as well as other devotees unchanging witness of yousands of modifications of the intellect delighted in contemplating his own form\n at the end of this samadhi hanuman asked with devotion o rama you are the supreme being of the nature of sat chid and ananda\n i desire to know your nature truly for liberation\n please tell me how i can be released from bondage wiyout strain\n rama well asked\n i shall tell you\n i am well established in vedanta\n hanuman what is vedanta and where is it rama the vedas in all their great extent are my breath vedanta is well grounded in them like oil in sesamum\n hanuman how many are the vedas and how many branches do they have of these what are the upanishads rama vedas are four rig veda etc\n many branches and upanishads exist in them\n rig veda has branches and yajus has \n sama has and atharva has \n each branch has one upanishad\n even by reading one verse of them with devotion one gets the status of union with me hard to get even by sages\n hanuman rama sages speak differently some say there is only one kind of liberation\n others say it can be got by worshipping your name and by the taraka mantra at kashi\n others speak of sankhya yoga and bhakti yoga the enquiry into vedanta vakyas etc\n rama liberation is of four kinds salokya etc\n but the only real type is kaivalya\n anybody even yough leading a wicked life attains salokya not other worlds by worshipping my name\n dying in the sacred brahmanala in kashi he will get the taraka mantra and also liberation wiyout rebirth\n on dying anywhere else in kashi maheshvara will utter the taraka mantra in his right ear\n he gets sarupya with me as his sins are washed away\n the same is called salokya and sarupya\n persevering in good conduct with mind fixed upon me loving me as the self of all the twice born gets nearer to me this is called the three forms of liberation\n salokya sarupya and samipya\n meditating on my eternal form as prescribed by the teacher one will surely achieve identity with me like the insects changing into the bee\n this alone is the liberation of identity sayujya yielding the bliss of brahman\n all these four kinds of mukti will be got by worshipping me\n but by what means is the kaivalya kind of moksha got the mandukya is enough if knowledge is not got from it then study the ten upanishads\n getting knowledge very soon you will reach my abode\n if certainty is not got even then study the upanishads and stop\n if desiring moksha wiyout the body read the upanishads\n muktika these destroy three kinds of bhavana regarding body senses and mind respectively as identified with atman\n the best of brahmanas will become jivanmuktas if they study upto the destruction of prarabdha these upanishads from a guru along with the shanti pada\n then in course of time they will get vedeha mukti surely\n these are the essence of all upanishads and can cut away all sins by merely hearing once\n these cause release whether read with or wiyout knowledge\n one may give away a kingdom wealth etc\n to one who asks but not these to just anyone to an unbeliever nastika ungrateful of bad conduct one against devotion to me deluded by wrong scripture or lacking devotion to the guru\n but they shall be taught to one devoted to service devotee of good conduct birth and wisdom\n he should be well tested\n a rik verse on this the goddess of knowledge came to a brahmana and said protect me i am your treasure do not teach me to one who is jealous dishonest and deceitful then i shall powerful but give it to one who is learned careful wise and celibate after examining him \n then maruti asked sri ramachandra thus please relate to me separately the shanti mantras of the different vedas rig etc\n sri rama then said my speech rests on my mind vanme manasi \n this is the shanti mantra of the following ten upanishads forming part of the rig veda \n bahvricha that which lies beyond is full purnamada \n and so on this is the shanti mantra of the following nineteen upanishads forming part of the sukla yajur veda \n muktika may the brahman of the upanishads protect us both sahanavavatu and so on this is the shanti mantra of the following thirty two upanishads forming part of the krishna yajur veda \n sarasvatirahasya may the unseen powers nourish apyayantu \n and so on this is the shanti mantra of the following sixteen upanishads forming part of the sama veda \n jabali may we hear with our ears the auspicious truths of the vedanta bhadram karnebhih and so on this is the shanti mantra of the following thirty one upanishads of the atharva veda \n garuda men who are seekers after liberation and well equipped with the four requisite means approach properly with gifts in the hands a good teacher who is dedicated belonging to a good family well versed in the vedas interested in the scriptures of good quality straightforward interested in the welfare of all creatures compassionate and learn in the prescribed manner the one hundred and eight upanishads study them through listening reflection and deep absorption continuously the accumulated karmas will be dissolved the three kinds of bodies gross subtle and causal are abandoned and like the ether of the pot when released from its upadhi rise to the level of fullness called videha mukti\n this indeed is the absolute liberation kaivalya mukti \n that is why even those in the brahma loka get identity with brahman after listening to the upanishads from his mouth\n and for everyone absolute liberation is stated to be attainable only through knowledge not through karma rituals not through sankhya yoga or worship\n then hanuman asked ramachandra what is this jivanmukti videha mukti what is the authority means of success and purpose rama said for a person there is bondage from doer ship enjoyer ship pleasure pain etc\n their prevention is liberation in the body\n videha mukti liberation wiyout the body is from the destruction of prarabdha operative karma like the space in a pot released from the conditioning enclosing pot\n for both the authority is the upanishads\n the purpose is eternal happiness through the stopping of the misery of doer ship etc\n this can be achieved by human effort just as a son is got by putra kama sacrifice wealth by trade etc\n and heaven by jyoit istoma\n there are these verses human effort is said to be of the two kinds for and against the shastras the former gives disaster the latter the ultimate reality\n true knowledge does not come to one from latent impressions through the world shastras and the body\n such impressions are two fold good and bad if you are induced by the good you shall reach me gradually but quickly the bad ones involved lead to trouble and should be overcome with effort\n the river of impression flowing through good and bad paths must be turned into the good path with human effort one should fondle the mind child with human effort\n when by means of practice good impressions arise then the practice has been fruitful\n even when this is in doubt practice only the good tendencies there shall be no fault\n the destruction of impressions cultivation of knowledge and destruction of the mind when pracit ised together for long will yield fruit\n if not pracit ised together there will be no success even after hundreds of years like mantras which are scattered\n when these three are pracit ised long the knots of the heart surely are broken like lotus fibre and the stalk\n the false impression of worldly life is got in a hundred lives and cannot be destroyed wiyout long practice\n so avoid desire of enjoyment as a distance with effort and pracit ise the three\n the wise know that the mind is bound by the impressions it is liberated when released well from them\n so o hanuman practice the destruction of mental impression quickly\n when impressions die out the mind becomes put out like a lamp\n whoever gives up impressions and concentrates on me wiyout strain he becomes bliss\n whether he concentrates on actions or not when he avoids all the desires of the heart he is doubtlessly liberated\n he has nothing to gain from action or inaction\n if his mind is not freed from impressions even samadhi and japa cannot give fruit\n the highest place cannot be got wiyout silence free from impressions\n sense organs like the eye go towards external objects wiyout voluntary impression but because of the latent impression just as the eye falls voluntarily wiyout attachment on external objects so the man of wisdom operates in work\n the sages know that vasana comprises all objects generated by creative faculty of the mind in attaining or avoiding them\n the very unsteady mind which is the cause of birth old age and death is generated by desire for objects in excess\n by the influence of vasana there is the pulsation of prana from it comes vasana again like seed and sprout\n for the tree of the human mind the pulsation and vasana are two seeds when one dies both die\n latent impressions stop operating through detached behaviour avoidance of worldly yought and realization that the body is mortal\n the mind becomes non mind by giving up vasanas\n when the mind does not think then arises mindlessness giving great peace so long as your mind has not fully evolved being ignorant of the supreme reality perform what has been laid down by the teacher shastra and other sources\n then with impurity ripened and destroyed and truth understood you should give up even the good impressions\n in a jivanmukta the destruction of the mind is with form in a videhamukta it is formless when you achieve it the mind with qualities like friendliness will surely attain peace\n the mind of the jivanmukta has no rebirth\n the mind is the root of the tree of samsara which has yousands of sprouts branches fruits etc\n i take the mind to be nothing but construction make it dry in such a way that the tree also is dried up\n there is only one means for overpowering mind\n shooting up of one s mind is one s undoing its destruction is good fortune\n the mind of the knower is destroyed it is a chain for the ignorant\n as long as the mind is not defeated by means of firm practice the impressions jump in the heart like ghosts at night\n the impressions of enjoyment die like lotus in winter for one whose mental pride is reduced and the senses the enemies are defeated\n one should at first conquer the mind hands locked in hands teeth set on teeth and limbs subdued\n the mind cannot be conquered wiyout defectless reasoning methods by merely sitting just as an elephant in rut wiyout a goad\n the reasons methods well nourished in mind conquest are knowledge of vedanta contact with good people giving up impressions and stopping of the pulsation of prana\n those who ignore these and control the mind by force throw away the lamp and search in darkness by means of soot also try to bind an elephant in rut by lotus fibre\n the tree of mind bearing the weight of the creepers of yought has two seeds the pulsation of prana and strong impressions\n all pervasive consciousness is shaken by the pulsation of prana in contrast by means of concentration the knowledge arises\n the dhyana its means is now imparted\n dissolving yought totally in the reverse order think only of the remaining pure consciousness\n after the apana sets and before prana arises in the heart there exists the state of kumbhaka immobility experienced by yogins\n kumbhaka in the external form is the fullness of prana after inbreath disappears and out breath arises\n by repeatedly pracit ising meditation of brahman wiyout ego samprajnata samadhi will be got\n the asamprajnata samadhi loved by yogins is from the mind giving great bliss after all the mental modifications youghts die away\n it is valued by sages being the spirit devoid of the light of ego of the mind of dream and of the intellect in deep sleep \n this concentration is other than what is not brahman\n full above below and in the middle the essence of goodness this state prescribed by the upanishads is the ultimate reality\n latent impression is that unexamined grasping of objects by persistent imagination\n what one brings into being through intense dispassion by one s self is realized quickly devoid of opposite impressions\n influenced by impressions a person looks upon those things as reality by the peculiarity of the impressions the ignorant person sees the spirit wrongly yough it does not lose its own nature\n the impure impression binds the pure destroys birth\n the impure one is solid ignorance and ego causes rebirth\n the restful state is like the roasted seed giving up the sprout of rebirth\n can the inner light be sought with chewing the cud of many shastras uselessly one who remains alone giving up perception as well as non perception is himself the brahman a person cannot know brahman by merely learning the four vedas and shastras as the ladle cannot taste the food\n if a person does not get detachment by the bad smell of his own body what other cause of detachment can be taught the body is very impure the soul is pure\n when one knows the difference what purification need be prescribed bondage is by impressions moksha is their destruction you give them up as well as the desire for moksha\n give up mental impressions of objects and cultivate pure impressions like friendship then discarding even these while acting according to them putting down all desires have only the impression of consciousness\n give up these too along with mind and intellect concentrate only on me\n contemplate me as devoid of sound touch form taste and smell eternal indestructible wiyout name and family destroying all suffering the nature of vision like the sky the one syllable om unsmearing yough omnipresent unique wiyout bondage forward across above below i fill ever place\n unborn ageless shining by myself not the cause nor effect ever contented when the body dies away giving up the state of jivanmukta one enter the videhamukti stage\n so says the rik that supreme place of vishnu the sages see ever like an eye extended in heaven\n the wise and awakened persons free from emotions keep it alight\n om this is the upanishad\n om that brahman is infinite and this universe is infinite\n the infinite proceeds from the infinite\n then taking the infinitude of the infinite universe it remains as the infinite brahman alone\n om let there be peace in me let there be peace in my environment let there be peace in the forces that act on me here ends the muktikopanishad belonging to the sukla yajur veda"
