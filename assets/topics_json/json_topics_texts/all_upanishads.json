    "Isa": "Isavasya Upanishad\nTranslated by Vidyavachaspati V. Panoli\nOm ! That is full; this is full, (for) from the full the full (indeed) arises.\nWhen the full is taken from the full, what remains is full indeed.\nOm! Peace! Peace! Peace!\n1. Om. All this should be covered by the Lord, whatsoever moves on the earth. By such a renunciation\nprotect (thyself). Covet not the wealth of others.\n2. By performing karma in this world (as enjoined by the scriptures) should one yearn to live a hundred\nyears. Thus action does not bind thee, the doer. There is no other way than this.\n3. Those worlds of Asuras (demons) are enshrouded by blinding gloom. Those who are the slayers of\nthe Self go to them after death.\n4. Unmoving, It is one, faster than the mind. The senses cannot reach It, for It proceeds ahead.\nRemaining static It overtakes others that run. On account of Its presence, Matarsiva (the wind)\nconducts the activities of beings.\n5. It moves; It moves not. It is far; It is near. It is within all; It is without all.\n6. He who perceives all beings in the Self alone, and the Self in all beings, does not entertain any hatred\non account of that perception.\n7. When a man realizes that all beings are but the Self, what delusion is there, what grief, to that\nperceiver of oneness?\n8. That (Self) is all-pervading, radiant, bodiless, sore less, without sinews, pure, untainted by sin, the\nall-seer, the lord of the mind, transcendent and self-existent. That (Self) did allot in proper order to the\neternal Prajapatis known as samvalsara (year) their duties.\n9. Those who worship avidya (karma born of ignorance) go to pitch darkness, but to a greater darkness\nthan this go those who are devoted to Vidya (knowledge of the Devatas).\n10. Different indeed, they say, is the result (attained) by vidya and different indeed, they say, is the\nresult (attained) by avidya. Thus have we heard from the wise who had explained it to us.\n11. He who knows both vidya and avidya together, transcends mortality through avidya and reaches\nimmortality through vidya.\n12. To pitch darkness they go who worship the Unmanifested (Prakriti). To a greater darkness than this\n\ngo those who are devoted to the Manifested (Hiranyagarbha).\n13. Different indeed, they say, is the result (attained) by the worship of the Manifested and different\nindeed, they say, is the result (attained) by the worship of the Unmanifested. Thus have we heard from\nthe wise who had explained it to us.\n14. He who knows both the Unmanifested and the destructible (Hiranyagarbha) together, transcends\ndeath by the (worship of) the destructible and attains immortality by the (worship of ) the\nUnmanifested.\n15. The face of the Truth (ie., Purusha in the solar orb) is veiled by a bright vessel. Mayst thou unveil it,\nO Sun, so as to be perceived by me whose dharma is truth.\n16. O nourisher, pilgrim of the solitude, controller, absorber (of all rasas), offspring of Prajapati, cast\naway thy rays, gather them up and give up thy radiating brilliance. That form of thine, most graceful, I\nmay behold. He, the Purusha (in the solar orb), I am.\n17. Let (my) vital air (prana) now attain the immortal Air (all-pervading Self); then let this body be\nreduced to ashes. Om, O mind, remember \u2013 remember that which has been done, O mind, remember \u2013\nremember that which has been done.\n18. O Fire, O Deva, knower of all our actions or all our knowledge, lead us by the good path for\nenjoying the fruits of actions. Liberate us from our deceitful sins. We offer thee ever more our words of\nadoration.\nOm! That is full; this is full, (for) from the full the full (indeed) arises.\nWhen the full is taken from the full, what remains is full indeed.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Isavasyopanishad, as contained in the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.\n\nIsha Upanishad Commentary\nCommentary on the Isavasya Upanishad\u2013by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\nSeeing All Things in God\nAn instructive story\nJust before going to India for the first time in 1962, I had the great good fortune to meet and hear Sri A.\nB. Purani, the administrator of the renowned Aurobindo Ashram of Pondicherry, India. From his lips I\nheard the most brilliant expositions of Vedic philosophy; nothing in my subsequent experience has\nequaled them. In one talk he told the following story:\nIn ancient India there lived a most virtuous Brahmin who was considered by all to be the best authority\n\non philosophy. One day the local king ordered him to appear before him. When he did so, the king said:\n\"I have three questions that puzzle-even torment-me: Where is God? Why don't I see Him? And what\ndoes he do all day? If you can't answer these three questions I will have your head cut off.\" The\nBrahmin was appalled and terrified, because the answers to these questions were not just complex, they\nwere impossible to formulate. In other words: he did not know the answers. So his execution date was\nset.\nOn the morning of that day the Brahmin's teenage son appeared and asked the king if he would release\nhis father if he-the son-would answer the questions. The king agreed, and the son asked that a container\nof milk be brought to him. It was done. Then the boy asked that the milk be churned into butter. That,\ntoo, was done.\n\"The first two of your questions are now answered,\" he told the king.\nThe king objected that he had been given no answers, so the son asked: \"Where was the butter before it\nwas churned?\"\n\"In the milk,\" replied the king.\n\"In what part of the milk?\" asked the boy.\n\"In all of it.\"\n\"Just so, agreed the boy, \"and in the same way God is within all things and pervades all things.\"\n\"Why don't I see Him, then,\" pressed the king.\n\"Because you do not 'churn' your mind and refine your perceptions through meditation. If you do that,\nyou will see God. But not otherwise. Now let my father go.\"\n\"Not at all,\" insisted the king. \"You have not told me what God does all day.\"\n\"To answer that,\" said the boy, \"we will have to change places. You come stand here and let me sit on\nthe throne.\"\nThe request was so audacious the king complied, and in a moment he was standing before the\nenthroned Brahmin boy who told him: \"This is the answer. One moment you were here and I was there.\nNow things are reversed. God perpetually lifts up and casts down every one of us. In one life we are\nexalted and in another we are brought low-oftentimes in a single life this occurs, and even more than\nonce. Our lives are completely in His hand, and He does with us as He wills.\"\nThe Brahmin was released and his son was given many honors and gifts by the king.\nThe Isha Upanishad opens with the answer to the question as to God's \"whereabouts.\"\nHe is within all\n\"In the heart of all things, of whatever there is in the universe, dwells the Lord.\" Whatever we\nexperience, whether through the inner or outer senses, it is a covering of the Lord (Isha). Since it\nconceals, it necessarily blinds, confuses, or inhibits us. It is a door closed in our face. Tragically,\nthroughout lives without number we have not known this simple fact and have as a consequence\nbelieved that the experienced, whether objective or subjective, is the sole reality and have dissipated\nlife after life in involvement with it to our pain and destruction. A door is never the way out: the way\n\nout is revealed when the door is moved aside-eliminated. Not knowing this, either, we have clawed,\nhammered, and hewn at the door-at least in those lives when we were not adulating and worshiping it\nor calling it \"God's greatest gift to us\"-to no avail. The root problem is our believing in the door's\nreality, thinking that it is the beginning, middle, and end. Only when it disappears will we see the truth\nthat lies beyond \"things.\"\nWe must not just get \"inside\" things, we must get to their heart. And how is that done? By getting into\nour own heart, into the core of our own being. There everything will be found. The key to the door is\nmeditation.\nAnother viewing\nPrabhavananda has conveyed the ultimate message of these opening words of the Isha Upanishad. The\nliteral translation, however, gives us another view which we should consider: \"All this--whatever exists\nin this changing universe--should be covered by the Lord.\" Rather than speaking of piercing to the\nheart of things, the literal meaning is that the Lord should be seen covering-that is, enveloping-all\nthings. This has two meanings.\n1) What I have just expressed, that we should experience-not just think intellectually-that God is\nencompassing all things, that we should not see things as independent or separate from God, but as\nexisting within God. And this vision should extend to us: we, too, exist only within Him.\n2) In our seeing of things, God should always be between us and them. First we should see God, and\nonly secondarily see the \"things.\"\nThe renowned Swami (Papa) Ramdas in his spiritual autobiography In Quest of God writes of his initial\nspiritual awakening in these words: \"It was at this time that it slowly dawned upon his mind that Ram\nwas the only Reality and all else was false....All thought, all mind, all heart, all soul was concentrated\non Ram, Ram covering up and absorbing everything.\"\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, considered to convey the essence of the Upanishadic wisdom, both\nPrabhavananda's and the literal translations are put together when Krishna tells Arjuna that the wise see\nGod in all things and all things in God.\nHe IS all\nIf we accept the foregoing, then we will take the next step and experience that \"He alone is the reality.\"\nThis can be understood more than one way. We can conclude that God alone is real and everything else\nis unreal. The problem with that is our tendency to equate \"unreal\" with non-existent, and wrongly\nbelief that everything is only an illusion, that it has no reality whatsoever. The great non-dual\nphilosopher Shankara explained the accurate view by likening our experience of things to that of a man\nwho sees a rope in dim light and mistakes it for a snake, his mind even supplying eyes that glitter and a\nmouth that hisses at him. When light is brought, he sees that there is no snake, only a rope. The snake\nwas not real, but his impression, however mistaken, was real. The snake was not real, it was nonexistent; but the impression of the snake was real and did exist. The rope was the reality and the snake\nwas an illusion overlain on it. In the same way God is the reality and everything else is illusory like the\nsnake. But illusion does exist. Denying it gets us nowhere; we have to deal with it by seeing through it,\nby dispelling it. Then we will see the reality: God. After that we can progress to the understanding that\neven though our interpretation may be wrong, what we perceive does have a real side to it, and that is\nGod Himself. Hence, all things are God in their real side. The \"wrong\" side is in our mind alone. We\ncan say that God is the reality of the unreal, which we need to see past. And that is the whole idea of\n\nthe opening verse of the upanishad. He alone is real; He is all things.\nBe at peace\n\"Wherefore, renouncing vain appearances, rejoice in him.\" All of our sorrows and troubles come from\nour mistaking vain appearances for reality, from our looking at them with our outer eyes instead of\nbeholding God with the inner eye. But we are addicted to those vain appearances-we have to admit\nthat. Yes, we are even addicted to all the pain and anxiety they bring us. That is foolish, but is it any\nmore foolish than it is to be addicted to drugs or alcohol-or to people that harm us? We are insane on\ncertain levels; this world is a madhouse for people of our particular lunacy. The sooner we understand\nthis and resolve to be cured and released, the better things will be for us. For from \"things\" we will\nmove on to God-perception.\nFor this reason the yogis, those who seek God in meditation, should be the most cheerful and optimistic\nof people. If we look to God we will see only perfection and rejoice in it; if we look at ourselves,\nothers, and the world around us we will see only imperfection and be discontent. Depression comes\nfrom looking in the wrong place. It is the bitter fruit of ego-involvement, of ego-obsession. The remedy\nis not to have \"high self-esteem\" but rather to have God-esteem. And since we live in God, we will see\nthe divine side even of ourselves and be ever hopeful. Once God spoke to a contemporary mystic and\nsaid: \"I am He Who Is. You are She Who Is Not.\" Now to the ego that may sound hateful, but to the\nquesting spirit it is a liberating assurance. The unreal which we call \"me\" need not be struggled with: it\nis only a ghost, a shadow. Bringing in the light of God-contact will reveal that to be the truth. Then we\nwill be at peace and in perfect joy. What a burden is lifted from those who come to know that God\nalone is real and true, and that we need only look to Him. When we look within we find Him as the\nheart of our selves.\nWe must renounce unreality. As I say, we are addicted to it, so we will have to struggle to break the\nterrible habit of delusion, just as those addicted to the hallucinations produced by drugs have to break\naway from them and discard them forever. Then we will \"rejoice in Him.\"\nDesirelessness\n\"Covet no man's wealth.\" Why? Because it does not exist! It is just a bubble destined to burst leaving\nnothing in its place. There are no \"things\" to covet or possess. They are the fever dreams of illusion\nfrom which we must awaken. No one really owns anything-firstly because the thing (as we perceive it)\ndoes not exist, and the \"man\" does not exist either; and neither do we-as least so far as our perceptions\nof \"them,\" \"it,\" and \"me\" go.\nGod and I in space alone\nAnd nobody else in view.\n\"And where are the people, O Lord!\" I said.\n\"The earth below and the sky o'erhead\nAnd the dead whom once I knew?\"\n\"That was a dream,\" God smiled and said,\n\"A dream that seemed to be true,\nThere were no people, living or dead,\nThere was no earth and no sky o'erhead\nThere was only Myself-and you.\"\n\"Why do I feel no fear,\" I asked,\n\n\"Meeting you here in this way,\nFor I have sinned I know full well,\nAnd there is heaven and there is hell,\nAnd is this the judgment day?\"\n\"Nay, those were dreams,\" the great God said,\n\"Dreams that have ceased to be.\nThere are no such things as fear or sin,\nThere is no you-you have never beenThere is nothing at all but Me.\"\n\nLiving a Life Worth Living\nHow to live\n\u201cWell may he be content to live a hundred years who acts without attachment who works his work with\nearnestness, but without desire, not yearning for its fruits\u2013he, and he alone.\u201d\nIt is generally felt that this verse\u2013and other passages from scriptures and books on spiritual life\u2013\nindicates that one hundred years is the normal lifespan for a human being. On the other hand, the figure\nof one hundred years may also symbolize the complete lifespan of a person, however brief or long, the\nidea here being that not one moment of our life need be a burden nor should we ever wish to shorten\nour life by a single breath\u2013that life should be lived in fulfillment with peace and happiness all the way\nthrough. That this is possible has been shown well by the saints and Masters of all religions and ages.\nWe need only know how to do it; and these words give the way.\nActing without attachment and desire\nIn the Bhagavad Gita Krishna draws very clearly for us the picture of a person who lives in anxiety and\nmisery and him who lives in peace and contentment. Both may be living in exactly the same situation,\nfor it is not external conditions that make us happy or miserable, but our reaction to them. Krishna\nmakes it quite plain that the secret of happiness or misery lies in the absence of two things: attachment\nand desire. Those who live in attachment to externalities, anxious to fulfill desire, must suffer and live\nin frustration. On the other hand, those who live without egoic desire are perpetually at peace.\nNonattachment\nKrishna not only holds out the ideal for us, He also tells us how to accomplish it.\n\u201cPerform every action with your heart fixed on the Supreme Lord. Renounce attachment to the fruits.\nBe even-tempered in success and failure; for it is this evenness of temper which is meant by yoga.\u201d\n(2:48)\n\u201cIn the calm of self-surrender you can free yourself from the bondage of virtue and vice during this\nvery life. Devote yourself, therefore, to reaching union with Brahman. To unite the heart with Brahman\nand then to act: that is the secret of non-attached work.\u201d (2:50)\n\u201cWhen your intellect has cleared itself of its delusions, you will become indifferent to the results of all\naction, present or future.\u201d (2:52)\n\u201cThe world is imprisoned in its own activity, except when actions are performed as worship of God.\n\nTherefore you must perform every action sacramentally, and be free from all attachments to results.\u201d\n(3:9)\n\u201cWhosoever works for me alone, makes me his only goal and is devoted to me, free from attachment,\nand without hatred toward any creature\u2013that man, O Prince, shall enter into me.\u201d (11:55)\n\u2018Therefore, a man should contemplate Brahman until he has sharpened the axe of his non-attachment.\nWith this axe, he must cut through the firmly-rooted Aswattha tree.\u201d (15:3)\n\u201cNo human being can give up action altogether, but he who gives up the fruits of action is said to be\nnon-attached.\u201d (18:11)\n\u201cWhen a man has achieved non-attachment, self-mastery and freedom from desire through\nrenunciation, he reaches union with Brahman, who is beyond all action.\u201d (18:49)\nIn other words, keeping the mind on God frees us from egoic attachment to our activities. This is an\nextremely high ideal and one very hard to attain; yet we must strive for it through the practice of\nmeditation, for only the clarity of vision reached through meditation can enable us to live out such a\nlofty ideal.\nWorking with earnestness\nLest we think that negative or passive indifference is detachment, or that carelessness and shoddiness in\nour daily work is spiritual-mindedness\u2013a view that prevails in much of the Orient and among many in\nthe West\u2013the Upanishad plainly tells us that the wise man \u201cworks his work with earnestness.\u201d This is\nreally a great portion of the Bhagavad Gita\u2019s message: that we must work with skill to the best of our\nabilities\u2013that is our part\u2013while leaving the results to God\u2013that is His part. In that way we truly are\n\u201cworkers together\u201d with God in our life. Sri Ramakrishna said: \u201cIf you can weigh salt you can weigh\nsugar,\u201d meaning that if a person is proficient in spiritual life he will be proficient in his outer life as\nwell. That does not mean that all yogis need to become great successes in business or some other\nprofession, but it does mean that they need to work with the full capabilities they possess and do\nabsolutely the best they can\u2013and no more; that is, they need not worry about the results. In this way\nthey will be at peace both internally and externally.\nWithout desire\nThe real cankerworm in the garden of our life is desire, whether in the form of wanting, wishing,\nyearning, desiring, hoping, demanding, or craving. Whether to a little or a great degree, desire destroys\nour hearts and our chances for inner peace. Desire is a wasting fever which drives us onward to\nspiritual loss. \u201cFor what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\u201d\nAs Wordsworth wrote: \u201cWe have given our hearts away\u2013a sordid boon!\u201d I have spent my entire life\nwatching people gain a little bit of the world and lose their souls. And ultimately they lost the world,\ntoo, either in the changes of earthly fortune or through the finality of death.\n\u201cAnd he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man\u2019s life consisteth not in the\nabundance of the things which he possesseth. And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of\na certain rich man brought forth plentifully: And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do,\nbecause I have no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my\nbarns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul,\nSoul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God\nsaid unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be,\n\nwhich thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.\u201d\nDesirelessness is not a zombie-like passivity, a kind of pious vegetating. Far from it. Krishna lauds the\ndesireless in these words:\nHe knows bliss in the Atman\nAnd wants nothing else.\nCravings torment the heart:\nHe renounces cravings.\nI call him illumined. (2:55)\nNot shaken by adversity,\nNot hankering after happiness:\nFree from fear, free from anger,\nFree from the things of desire.\nI call him a seer, and illumined. (2:56)\nThe bonds of his flesh are broken.\nHe is lucky, and does not rejoice:\nHe is unlucky, and does not weep\nI call him illumined. (2:57)\nThe tortoise can draw in its legs:\nThe seer can draw in his senses.\nI call him illumined. (2:58)\nThe abstinent run away from what they desire\nBut carry their desires with them:\nWhen a man enters Reality,\nHe leaves his desires behind him. (2:59)\nThe desireless who have fulfilled themselves in God are the most alive, happy, and satisfied of beings.\nSurely they\u2013and they alone\u2013are \u201ccontent to live a hundred years.\u201d For them there is no talk of death\nbeing a \u201cblessed release\u201d (which it is not), for they are already freed in spirit.\n\nSpiritual Suicides\n\u201cWorlds there are without suns, covered up with darkness. To these after death go the ignorant, slayers\nof the Self.\u201d (\u201cVerily, those worlds of the asuras are enveloped in blind darkness; and thereto they all\nrepair after death who are slayers of Atman.\u201d This is the translation of Swami Nikhilananda.)\nThe Upanishadic seer opens by speaking of the way of fulfilled and joyful life: seeing the Divine in all\nthings, and living on the earth according to Divine Law. But this is not the only world in which we can\nfind ourself as we move through a cycle of continuous birth and death\u2013birth into one world after having\ndied out of another, or another birth into the world where we were just living. When we speak of\n\u201cbirth\u201d we usually think only of physical embodiment on this earth. But when we die in this world we\nare born into an astral world where we remain for some time and then die to that world and become\nborn back into this world. Although this world remains virtually the same\u2013despite the fact that every\n\ngeneration thinks it is a great advance over previous eras\u2013we can spend time in a vast array of astral\nworlds, positive and negative, pleasant and unpleasant. The earth becomes a kind of stable place of\nreturn for us. Or is it?\nMany births, many worlds\nAlthough the earth accommodates a wide range of spiritual and psychological evolution, the astral\nworlds are more specialized. There is an astral world for every degree of consciousness. These worlds\ncan be classified just as sentient beings are classified. That does not say much, since each person can\nhave a different set of criteria for such classification. But the masters of wisdom have generally agreed:\nthere are two basic kinds of people\u2013suras and asuras, those who dwell in the light and those who live in\nthe dark. \u201cDivine\u201d and \u201cdemonic\u201d are commonly used to translate sura\u2013or deva\u2013and asura. A sura/deva\nis in the light, an asura is not. Sometimes a person dwells in the dark by choice, but most often it is a\nstate of ignorance rather than negative volition. Because of this we need to avoid a \u201cdeva is good, asura\nis bad\u201d reaction in all cases, though there are instances when this is accurate, and to repress it would be\nfoolish\u2013and asuric!\nThe sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita\nPractically speaking, however\u2013that is, looking at the result of manifesting those natures\u2013it is just that\nsimple. An entire chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is directed to this manner of divine (devic) and demonic\n(asuric) nature as it manifests in human beings. I know it is pretty lengthy, but it is so insightful and\ncomplete that it merits inclusion here. Sri Krishna speaks:\n\u201cA man who is born with tendencies toward the Divine, is fearless and pure in heart. He perseveres in\nthat path to union with Brahman which the scriptures and his teacher have taught him. He is charitable.\nHe can control his passions. He studies the scriptures regularly, and obeys their directions. He practices\nspiritual disciplines. He is straightforward, truthful, and of an even temper. He harms no one. He\nrenounces the things of this world. He has a tranquil mind and an unmalicious tongue. He is\ncompassionate toward all. He is not greedy. He is gentle and modest. He abstains from useless activity.\nHe has faith in the strength of his higher nature. He can forgive and endure. He is clean in thought and\nact. He is free from hatred and from pride. Such qualities are his birthright.\n\u201cWhen a man is born with demonic tendencies, his birthright is hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger,\ncruelty and ignorance.\n\u201cThe birthright of the divine nature leads to liberation. The birthright of the demonic nature leads to\ngreater bondage. But you need not fear, Arjuna: your birthright is divine.\n\u201cIn this world there are two kinds of beings: those whose nature tends toward the Divine, and those\nwho have the demonic tendencies. I have already described the divine nature to you in some detail.\nNow you shall learn more about the demonic nature.\n\u201cMen of demonic nature know neither what they ought to do, nor what they should refrain from doing.\nThere is no truth in them, or purity, or right conduct. They maintain that the scriptures are a lie, and that\nthe universe is not based upon a moral law, but godless, conceived in lust and created by copulation,\nwithout any other cause. Because they believe this in the darkness of their little minds, these degraded\ncreatures do horrible deeds, attempting to destroy the world. They are enemies of mankind.\n\u201cTheir lust can never be appeased. They are arrogant, and vain, and drunk with pride. They run blindly\nafter what is evil. The ends they work for are unclean. They are sure that life has only one purpose:\n\ngratification of the senses. And so they are plagued by innumerable cares, from which death alone can\nrelease them. Anxiety binds them with a hundred chains, delivering them over to lust and wrath. They\nare ceaselessly busy, piling up dishonest gains to satisfy their cravings.\n\u201c\u2018I wanted this and today I got it. I want that: I shall get it tomorrow. All these riches are now mine:\nsoon I shall have more. I have killed this enemy. I will kill all the rest. I am a ruler of men. I enjoy the\nthings of this world. I am successful, strong and happy. Who is my equal? I am so wealthy and so nobly\nborn. I will sacrifice to the gods. I will give alms. I will make merry.\u2019 That is what they say to\nthemselves, in the blindness of their ignorance.\n\u201cThey are addicts of sensual pleasure, made restless by their many desires, and caught in the net of\ndelusion. They fall into the filthy hell of their own evil minds. Conceited, haughty, foolishly proud, and\nintoxicated by their wealth, they offer sacrifice to God in name only, for outward show, without\nfollowing the sacred rituals. These malignant creatures are full of egoism, vanity, lust, wrath, and\nconsciousness of power. They loathe me, and deny my presence both in themselves and in others. They\nare enemies of all men and of myself; cruel, despicable and vile. I cast them back, again and again, into\nthe wombs of degraded parents, subjecting them to the wheel of birth and death. And so they are\nconstantly reborn, in degradation and delusion. They do not reach me, but sink down to the lowest\npossible condition of the soul.\u201d\nAm I an asura?\nWhat are the basic traits that render someone an asura? The Upanishad has already given them: 1)\nspiritual blindness, 2) spiritual darkness, 3) spiritual ignorance, and 4) engaging in deeds that \u201ckill\u201d the\nawareness and the freedom of the eternal, immortal, divine self. The first three are what dispose us to\nthe fourth, destructive trait. Krishna has already given us quite an exposition of the ways of the asuric\npersonality, but it can all be summed up in their effect: the negation of consciousness of the individual\nspirit. Now this point that spiritual ignorance is a matter of unawareness of the individual spirit, our\nown atman, is particularly important because many asuras think to hide their status under an\nexternalized cloak of religiosity, of supposed belief in and dedication to God. But this is all nonsense.\nSaint John the Apostle comments that no one can legitimately claim to love God Whom they have not\nseen if they have no love for their fellow human beings whom they have seen. In the same way, it is\nabsurd to pretend that we know or are aware of the infinite Spirit when we are not aware of the finite\nspirit\u2013our own self\u2013which is right within us. This is why Buddha simply refused to speak about God or\ngods, and insisted that each one must seek for nirvana alone, rejecting all other matters as harmful\ndistractions.\nAnother Upanishad states that if we learn about water from a single cup of water we can then know\nabout oceans of water. In the same way, if we come to truly comprehend our nature as spirit we will be\nable to know God the Infinite Spirit. Thus self-knowledge\u2013knowledge of our spirit\u2013is essential.\nShankara says that until we know the self we are all asuras in the absolute sense, but if we are seeking\nto know the self I expect the distinction is not so drastic.\nAn asura, then, is one whose life and thought obscure and darken the inner consciousness so the true\nself remains unknown and buried\u2013often even unsuspected as to its existence. It has nothing to do with\nwhat philosophers and theologians say about it; the matter is thoroughly pragmatic. Do we or don\u2019t we,\nare we or aren\u2019t we? Verbal claims mean nothing here. State of being alone matters.\nThe worlds of the asuras\nBecause it is their will, asuras are born over and over in worlds \u201cenveloped in blind darkness\u201d at the\n\ntime of their death, earthly or astral. Naturally our thoughts go to the ideas of \u201chell\u201d so beloved to all\nreligionists, east and west, whether it is the absurdly simplistic fire pit of Christianity or the horrifically\ncomplex and lurid hell(s) of Hinduism, Taoism, or Buddhism. But what is this world in which we\npresently find ourselves\u2013a world ravaged with hatred, violence, disease, cruelty, and aggressive\nignorance and greed? The fact that there is also kindness, love, mercy, and toleration in the world\nmakes it even more crazy: schizophrenic and schizophrenogenic (making us crazy). No wonder The\nOnion, a satirical magazine, ran an article entitled: \u201cGod Diagnosed With Bipolar Disorder.\u201d It might\nseem blasphemous, but it is the preposterous religion prevailing in the West that is blasphemous, and\nthe satire is just pointing it out.\nSomeone once asked Paramhansa Yogananda if he believed in hell. Paramhansaji smiled and asked:\n\u201cWhere do you think you are?\u201d A very good question, indeed.\nWe write our own ticket by the way we think and act. No amount of rationalization or assurance from\nothers will change this fact. If we seek darkness we will find darkness; if we seek the light we will find\nthe light. Nothing more; nothing less.\n\u201cAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for\nevery one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be\nopened.\u201d\nJust be aware of the consequences.\n\nThe Undivided Unmoving Self\nThe teachings of the upanishads are the supreme expressions of the eternal wisdom, the eternal vision\nof the Vedic Seers. Consequently, though simple in their mode of expression, they can be extremely\nhard to grasp. The rishis lived in a state of consciousness almost opposite to that of most of us. But it is\npossible of attainment, and so the wise cultivate it. Yet we need guidance along the way, and need to\ncarefully look into the upanishadic dicta for that guidance. There are many things that we need not\nknow, but the truths embodied in the upanishads and their inspired summary, the Bhagavad Gita, must\nbe known by all who would ascend to higher life. So they merit our intent consideration.\nThe four levels of understanding\nDuring the last week of his earthly life, Jesus was in Jerusalem at the Passover season. At one point,\nwhile speaking to the crowd, he prayed: \u201cFather, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from\nheaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people therefore, that stood by,\nand heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.\u201d And of course a third\ncontingency heard nothing. This is how it is in this world of unreality when Reality impinges on it.\nAccording to the level of development, so the encountering individual reacts to the impingement.\nIn Indian philosophy there are a lot of numerical divisions, but one of the most prevalent is that of Four.\nTo list some: there are four ages (yugas) of human history, there are four modes of consciousness\n(waking, dreaming, dreamless sleep and turiya\u2013consciousness itself), there are four stages of dharmic\nlife (student, family, semi-solitary, and monastic), and of course there are four castes (shudra, vaishya,\nkshatriya and brahmin). All of these relate to the evolutionary development of the individual (as\nKrishna says: guna and karma) and are fundamentally a matter of internal disposition and capacity.\nThese four levels (is it an accident there are four Gospels?) are depicted in this event. Some people\nheard what was spoken and knew it was the voice of God; some heard a voice\u2013not the actual words\u2013\n\nand thought it was an angel speaking; some heard an indistinct sound and thought it was thunder; and\nothers (no doubt the majority) heard nothing at all. It is not an event that matters as much as our\ncomprehension of it.\nYes, that is everything: comprehension. And that takes place only according to our state of inner\ndevelopment. Krishna spoke of this in the beginning of his instruction to Arjuna at Kurukshetra, saying:\n\u201cThere are some who have actually looked upon the Atman, and understood It, in all Its wonder. Others\ncan only speak of It as wonderful beyond their understanding. Others know of Its wonder by hearsay.\nAnd there are others who are told about It and do not understand a word.\u201d Here again are the four\nlevels of comprehension. We pass from one to another in ascending steps only through inner\ncultivation\u2013in other words, only through meditation, but meditation supported by a entire way of life\nthat facilitates it\u2013in other words: dharma. For if there is neither the practice nor the support for the\npractice, little will result in the way of developing consciousness. And if consciousness is not\ndeveloped the teachings of the great sages will be little understood by us, and perhaps greatly\nmisunderstood or just not understood at all.\nSri Ramakrishna told about a certain group of yogis who were wont to challenge a person with the\nwords: \u201cWhat station are you dwelling in?\u201d By \u201cstation\u201d they meant the habitual state of the\nindividual\u2019s mind. The next verse of the Isha Upanishad is not easy to grasp because it speaks of a\nmode of being far different from our usual condition. So it will be a real test as to what \u201cstation\u201d of\nconsciousness we are dwelling in, as we try to decode it. Here it is:\n\u201cThe Self is one. Unmoving, it moves swifter than thought. The senses do not overtake it, for always it\ngoes before. Remaining still, it outstrips all that run. Without the Self, there is no life.\u201d\n\u201cThe Self is one\u201d\n\u201cOne\u201d has two meanings in Eastern thought: 1) number and 2) quality. This a very important point,\nsince many controversies have arisen philosophically simply because Western thinkers tend to limit\n\u201cone\u201d to a numerical value only. The incredibly bitter and violent controversy over the so-called\n\u201cMonophysite heresy\u201d in early Christianity in which tens of thousands of Egyptians and Syrians were\nkilled by the armies of the Byzantine empire, took place only because the Italian-Byzantines could not\ngrasp what the \u201cheretics\u201d meant by the simple word monos when applied to spiritual matters. Both\nmeanings, number and quality, have significance for us who, like the Four Kumaras, are intent on the\nknowing of the self.\nThe principle that the self is one should set us to thinking about our own present self-concept and\u2013\nperhaps even more important\u2013the way we live out our self-concept. Many people think one thing\nintellectually (or at least verbally, for public consumption) and think another instinctively. For example,\nI knew a minister who was once challenged by a self-styled atheist who spent about an hour\nexpounding the \u201ctruth\u201d of atheism and the folly of theism. When he was finished the minister said:\n\u201cThere are two points about all that you have just said. One: it is complete nonsense. Two: you do not\nbelieve a word of it yourself.\u201d The man threw his right hand up in the air and declaimed: \u201cI swear to\nGod in heaven that I do!\u201d\nSomewhere I have already mentioned that an Eastern Christian theological student once remarked to\nme that the worse thing that had ever happened to Western Christianity and Western philosophy in\ngeneral was the invention of the \u201cpie chart\u201d\u2013those round diagrams divided into \u201cslices\u201d that plagued us\nthroughout school in many subjects, from mathematics to sociology. \u201cPeople have come to think that\nthey are conglomerations of pieces that make up a whole, rather than a single homogenous being,\u201d he\nexplained. How many times do people speak of having several \u201croles\u201d in life or of wearing many\n\n\u201chats.\u201d Fragmentation is a terrible plague destroying our capacity to either see or attain unityintegration of our being. We think it is all right to be multiple persons. Where this all began with us is\nburied in the past, but the present reality cannot be denied. Drawn out from our center of unity, we say:\n\u201cI am a businessman, a spouse, a parent, a citizen\u2026\u201d etc., rather than: \u201cI am a single person who\nfunctions in the area of business, marriage, parenthood, citizenship\u2026\u201d etc. This no small thing, and\ncertainly not merely a philosophical nicety. This is a serious mental and spiritual disorder. Being both\nfragmented and dispersed in our energies and awareness, rather than operating from a central point of\norder, the mirror of our life is shattered into innumerable fragments that cannot convey any coherent\nimage of our \u201cface.\u201d The unity that is the true image is defaced, effaced, and even erased\u2013as far as our\nconsciousness is concerned, even though our true nature can never be altered in any manner. Struggling\nand submerged in the illusion of multiplicity, the truth of our unity is far from us. For we are not just\none numerically, we are absolutely one in nature. This is an eternal truth that must be regained by us.\nHow to do so? By the only process that really unifies the consciousness: meditation.\n\u201cUnmoving, it moves swifter than thought\u201d\nHow can the self move swifter than thought and yet be unmoving? This is not some koan-like platitude\nmeant to faze our mind in relation to self-knowledge; it is simple fact. The self, the spirit, is completely\noutside of time and space (which are illusions, anyway), yet it can scan time and space, moving\nbackward and forward simply because of the fact that it is one. Being one in the truest sense, the self is\neverywhere\u2013since there really is no \u201cwhere\u201d at all. The self is truly Whole and therefore all-embracing.\nIt moves swifter than thought, because a thought requires a time\u2013however small\u2013to arise or be\nexpressed. The self, in contrast, exists only in the Now. The questions \u201cWhere did I come from?\u201d\n\u201cWhere am I going?\u201d \u201cWhat was I in the past?\u201d and \u201cWhat shall I be in the future?\u201d are valuable\nbecause they set us on the quest to the discovery that we do not come or go, nor do we have a past or\nfuture\u2013only a Present. When Sri Ramana Maharshi was at the end of his physical embodiment he\ncommented: \u201cThey say I am \u2018going,\u2019 but where shall I go?\u201d Some years later Sri Anandamayi Ma\nvisited Ramanashram. When the Maharshi\u2019s disciples asked her to stay there, feeling that in her they\nhad \u201crefound\u201d their guru, she simply remarked: \u201cI neither come nor go.\u201d This is true of us, as well.\n\u201cThe senses do not overtake it, for always it goes before\u201d\nThe self does not move, but it is \u201calways before\u201d the questing senses in the sense that it is always out of\ntheir reach. The Mandukya Upanishad, speaking of the consciousness of the self, of turiya, describes it\nas \u201cnot subjective experience, nor objective experience, nor experience intermediate between these\ntwo, nor is it a negative condition which is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness. It is not the\nknowledge of the senses, nor is it relative knowledge, nor yet inferential knowledge. Beyond the\nsenses, beyond the understanding, beyond all expression,\u2026it is pure unitary consciousness, wherein\nawareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely obliterated. It is ineffable peace. It is the\nsupreme good. It is One without a second. It is the Self. Know it alone!\u201d Who can say any more?\n\u201cRemaining still, it outstrips all that run\u201d\nThe self is unmoving, as we have been told. Hence, any \u201cmovement\u201d is incompatible with it and blots\nit from our awareness. That which moves cannot possibly perceive it, nor can any process of movement\n(including the labyrinthine ways of so much \u201cyoga\u201d) ever result in touching or seeing it. Rather,\nmovement must cease, as Patanjali points out in the very beginning of the Yoga Sutras: Yoga is the\ncessation of movement in the mind-substance. In other words, when we stop \u201crunning\u201d we will rest in\nour self.\n\u201cWithout the Self, there is no life\u201d\n\nThis is perhaps the hardest lesson for human beings to learn: Without the Self, there is no life. We may\nengage in frantic activity, running here and there and \u201caccomplishing\u201d tremendous things, indulging the\nsenses to the maximum and immersing ourselves in ambitions, emotions, and \u201crelationships,\u201d but\nthrough it all the truth is simply this: we are dead, mere wraiths feeding desperately on a shadow life\nthat is no life at all\u2013not even a poor imitation. In the self alone do we find life. How hard this is to\nlearn, and how much harder it is to follow through on, for it inevitably leads to the total renunciation of\nall that is not the self\u2013in other words, to the renunciation of everything we hold dear and identify with\nas being ours and our \u201cself\u201d when they are no such thing at all. This is a bitter insight in the beginning,\nbut as our inner eye begins to adjust to the truth of it, we find it the source of greatest joy.\nWho knows the Atman\nKnows that happiness\nBorn of pure knowledge:\nThe joy of sattwa.\nDeep his delight\nAfter strict self-schooling:\nSour toil at first\nBut at last what sweetness,\nThe end of sorrow.\nHe knows bliss in the Atman\nAnd wants nothing else.\nCravings torment the heart:\nHe renounces cravings.\nI call him illumined.\nNot shaken by adversity,\nNot hankering after happiness:\nFree from fear, free from anger,\nFree from the things of desire.\nI call him a seer, and illumined.\nThe recollected mind is awake\nIn the knowledge of the Atman\nWhich is dark night to the ignorant:\nThe ignorant are awake in their sense-life\nWhich they think is daylight:\nTo the seer it is darkness.\nThis is the state of enlightenment in Brahman:\nA man does not fall back from it\nInto delusion.\nEven at the moment of death\nHe is alive in that enlightenment:\nBrahman and he are one.\nSo, with his heart serene and fearless,\nFirm in the vow of renunciation,\nHolding the mind from its restless roaming,\nNow let him struggle to reach my oneness,\n\nEver-absorbed, his eyes on me always,\nHis prize, his purpose.\n\u201cWhen a man has achieved non-attachment, self-mastery and freedom from desire through\nrenunciation, he reaches union with Brahman, who is beyond all action.\u201d\nA great deal is involved when we sincerely pray: \u201cLead me from death to immortality.\u201d\n\nThe Ever-Present Self\n\u201cTo the ignorant the Self appears to move\u2013yet it moves not. From the ignorant it is far distant\u2013yet it is\nnear. It is within all, and it is without all.\u201d\n\u201cThe Self appears to move\u2013yet it moves not\u201d\nWe have just covered the fact that, being outside of the illusions of time and space, the self neither\n\u201cmoves\u201d nor goes through any type of change whatsoever. Yet it \u201cexperiences\u201d a multiplicity of\nexternalities as the unmoving witness\u2013momentarily caught up in the movie and thinking it is inside it\nand undergoing the changes in the scenario. Just as imagining seeing or doing something is not the\nsame as seeing or doing it, so observing the motion picture of countless lives with their attendant joys\nand sorrows is not the same as actually being born, living, and dying over and over. But we are deluded\ninto thinking so, and the upanishadic sage is endeavoring to wake us up, just as we awaken someone\nwho is having a nightmare and calling out in pain or fear. We, however, having become accustomed\n(even addicted) to the nightmare, are a lot more difficult to awaken.\n\u201cIt is far distant\u2013yet it is near\u201d\nSince the self is existing in eternity, transcending any degree of relativity, it could not be \u201cfurther\u201d away\nfrom the relative realm of experience (not existence, because the relative does not actually \u201cexist\u201d at all\nexcept as an illusion). On the other hand, since relativity is only a concept, the self is the nearest\npossible because it alone is actually present!\nAt the end of the Syrian Jacobite Liturgy the celebrant gives a blessing beginning: \u201cYou who are far\nand you who are near\u2026.\u201d The reference is not to those who are at the back of the church and those who\nare at the front, but to those who are far and near in their minds and hearts.\nFor those who are immersed in the illusion of relativity, nothing could be further away than the\ntranscendent self. Yet, since as I have said, the self alone is ever present, it is nearer than any relative\nexperiencing. It is, as the Kena Upanishad says, the \u201cear of the ear, mind of the mind, speech of speech.\n\u2026also breath of the breath, and eye of the eye.\u201d\n\u201cIt is within all, and it is without all\u201d\nNothing can exist apart from the self\u2013even an illusion. A hallucination is a \u201cthing\u201d even though it is\nsolely mental. The self is the substratum upon and within which everything subsists, the screen on\nwhich the light-and-shadow play of \u201clife\u201d is projected. It is itself the basis of all that is perceived. From\none perspective it can be said that the self (consciousness) is inside everything. From another, since it is\nforever separate from all things, it can be spoken of as outside\u2013alien to\u2013all things. Whichever way you\nsay it, the idea is the same: the self never touches any \u201cthing.\u201d\nThe effect of \u201cseeing true\u201d\n\n\u201cHe who sees all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings, hates none.\u201d Here we come to the\npractical application of what the upanishad is telling us about the self. (This is the inestimable value of\nthe Bhagavad Gita. Where the Upanishads express spiritual mathematics in a usually abstract manner,\nthe Gita outlines both the upanishadic principles and what the result will be when they are followed or\nrealized, defining spiritual realities in practical, observable terms.)\nIf we never lose sight of the self, then we will be able to perceive what is not the self. And since what is\nnot the self is not even real, why would we hate it? Conversely, how could we hate or be averse to the\nreal self? This vision is the foundation of dynamic even-mindedness.\nIt is also the absolute end of all delusion and negative reaction to it, for the upanishad concludes: \u201cTo\nthe illumined soul, the Self is all. For him who sees everywhere oneness, how can there be delusion or\ngrief?\u201d\n\nThe All-Embracing Self\n\u201cWhere one sees nothing but the One, hears nothing but the One, knows nothing but the One\u2013there is\nthe Infinite. Where one sees another, hears another, knows another\u2013there is the finite. The Infinite is\nimmortal, the finite is mortal.\u201d\n\u201cTo the illumined soul, the Self is all. For him who sees everywhere oneness, how can there be\ndelusion or grief?\n\u201cThe Self is everywhere. Bright is he, bodiless, without scar of imperfection, without bone, without\nflesh, pure, untouched by evil. The Seer, the Thinker, the One who is above all, the Self-Existent\u2014he it\nis that has established perfect order among objects and beings from beginningless time.\u201d\n\u201cThe Self is everywhere\u201d\nBeing outside of time and space the self is both everywhere and nowhere\u2013depending on one\u2019s point of\nreference. One thing is definite: the self cannot be separated from to any degree and is always present\nin the fullest measure. This being so, we need not seek the self, but only realize it. We are always\nseeing, touching, and living in the self, yet we do not recognize it, just as fish have no perception of\nwater because of its intimate and integral connection with them. The self is even more immediate to us\nthan is water to the fish.\nThe most practical application of this truth is simple: We should always we aware of the self and\ncentered in the self. And that is done by the continual meditation and japa of Om.\n\u201cMeditate on Om as the Self.\u201d\n\u201cThe Self [atman] is of the nature of the Syllable Om. Thus the Syllable Om is the very Self. He who\nknows It thus enters the Self [Supreme Spirit] with his self [individual spirit].\u201d\n\u201cDirectly realize the self by meditating on Om.\u201d\n\u201cThe syllable \u2018Om\u2019 is the self.\u201d\n\u201cEarnest seekers who, incessantly and with a steady mind, repeat \u2018Om\u2019 will attain success. By\nrepetition of the pure \u2018Om\u2019 the mind is withdrawn from sense objects and becomes one with the Self.\u201d\n\u201cBright is he\u201d\n\nIn the Katha Upanishad it is said of the self: \u201cHim the sun does not illumine, nor the moon, nor the\nstars, nor the lightning\u2013nor, verily, fires kindled upon the earth. He is the one light that gives light to\nall. He shining, everything shines.\u201d The self is illumined by no external light, but rather illumines all\nitself. We could shine the brightest of lights into the eyes of a dead man and he would see nothing. But\nif the self is present to enliven him, then he will. The self is known\u2013seen\u2013by the self, and therefore it is\ncalled swayamprakash: self-illumined. Hence only those in contact with their self can be said to\npossess illumination to any degree. Those who under the banner of \u201cdevotion\u201d obsess on external\npractices and deities can only dwell in the \u201clight that is darkness.\u201d We must seek illumination in the self\nalone, keeping in mind that God is the Self of the self, that to seek one is to seek the other.\nSukram, the word translated \u201cbright,\u201d also means pure in the sense of being of such perfect clarity that\nno light is obscured. For it is from the core of the self that the Pure Light of God shines forth.\nTherefore, as just pointed out, to attain self-knowledge is to realize both the atman and the\nParamatman. Only when we are centered in our self can we see God, and only when we are centered in\nGod can we truly know our self.\nIn a flawless crystal, what do we see? Nothing. So also, in the self there is nothing seen, for all \u201cthings\u201d\nare transcended, and pure Being alone remains in our consciousness. Wherefore the Chandogya\nUpanishad tells us: \u201cWhere one sees nothing but the One, hears nothing but the One, knows nothing\nbut the One\u2013there is the Infinite. Where one sees another, hears another, knows another\u2013there is the\nfinite. The Infinite is immortal, the finite is mortal.\u201d\n\u201cBodiless\u201d\nObviously the self is not material, but it is necessary for us to further realize that the self never touches\nmateriality, that in never \u201chas\u201d a body in the sense that it is integrated with a body and either affects it\nor is affected by it. This is extremely important, for religion (and a lot of \u201cyoga\u201d) usually leads us\nastray by getting us to be involved in a multitude of activities that\u2013including intellectual study and\nconceptualizations\u2013are taking place only in the various bodies (koshas) and therefore have nothing\nwhatsoever to do with the self, and hence are usually irrelevant. It is true that we need to purify and\nrefine the bodies so they will cease to veil or obscure the self, but we should understand that the entire\nprocess takes place outside the self and never affects the self to any degree.\nIt is also necessary to comprehend that the self is not really \u201cin\u201d the body(ies) at all, for by its very\nnature it cannot be encompassed or contained by anything, including the body. \u201cThey are contained in\nme, but I am not in them,\u201d says Krishna. And the same is true of our own self.\nTo realize the self we must disengage our awareness totally from the bodies, although in the practice of\nmeditation we use the bodies as stepping-stones to approach the self and eventually transcend them\naltogether. So we need not reject the bodies\u2013simply have the correct perspective regarding them.\n\u201cWithout scar of imperfection\u201d\nImperfection can occur only in the level of relativity. Being eternally outside of relative existence it is\nnot possible for the self to ever be \u201cmarked\u201d for either good or bad\u2013neither of which even exists for the\nself. In Yoga Sutra 1:24, Patanjali describes the Supreme Lord, saying: \u201cIshwara is a distinct spirit,\nuntouched by troubles, actions and their results, and latent impressions.\u201d The relevant idea here is that\nGod is beyond all action and therefore incapable of either incurring karma or of being conditioned or\naffected in any way by action\u2013since He never acts. Exactly the same is true of the self.\n\u201cWithout bone, without flesh\u201d\n\nObviously the self has no body\u2013that has already been said\u2013so why this statement about the self being\nwithout bone or flesh? The idea being presented is that the self has no \u201cinner\u201d or \u201couter.\u201d It has no\nessence as a substratum or framework (skeleton) which can become the ground or basis of another,\nexternal entity that is an extension of mutation of itself. The self has neither parts nor appendages\n(upadhis). It is thoroughly homogenous and absolutely one. It cannot be \u201cmore\u201d itself or \u201cless\u201d itself.\nThere are no gradations or shadings in the self. It simply IS.\n\u201cPure\u201d\nWe have already considered the purity of the self and need only add one more point: The self is also\n\u201cpure\u201d because there is nothing intervening between the self and anything else\u2013including God. It is\nabsolute and direct without admixture of any kind.\n\u201cUntouched by evil\u201d\nObviously the self is untouched by evil, for it is not touched (affected) by anything at all or at any time.\n\u201cThe Seer\u201d\nThe unwitnessed witness is the self. In truth there is no other witness on the individual level because\nthe senses, mind, and intellect are mere energy constructs that have no consciousness of their own. The\neye never really sees, nor does the ear hear. No more does the brain or intellect. Rather, the spirit that is\nconsciousness witnesses their messages, therefore the upanishadic seer said: \u201cThe Self is ear of the ear,\nmind of the mind, speech of speech. He is also breath of the breath, and eye of the eye. Having given\nup the false identification of the Self with the senses and the mind, and knowing the Self to be\nBrahman, the wise, on departing this life, become immortal.\u201d And of Brahman it was said: \u201cHe who\nknows Brahman to be the life of life, the eye of the eye, the ear of the ear, the mind of the mind\u2013he\nindeed comprehends fully the cause of all causes.\u201d\nRegarding the self and the Self of the self, Krishna stated:\nWatching over the ear and the eye, and presiding\nThere behind touch, and taste, and smell, he is also\nWithin the mind: he enjoys and suffers\nThe things of the senses.\n\u201cThe Thinker\u201d\nNot being the brain, only its witness and not its possessor, the self is here called \u201cthe thinker\u201d only as\nan attempt to convey the idea that it is the self that both witnesses and knows what it is witnessing. It is\nnot just a screen on which the motion picture of life is projected, nor is it a consciousness of objects\nalone without cognition of their nature. An infant or an animal perceives exactly what an adult human\nbeing perceives, but has no idea what it is perceiving\u2013or even that it perceives, in many cases. The self,\non the other hand, does indeed know and comprehend what is presented to its view. And because of its\nproximity the will and intellect respond to the stimuli, mirroring the consciousness that is the self.\nConsequently they are often mistaken for the self or wrongly supposed to have a consciousness and\nintelligence of their own.\n\u201cThe One who is above all\u201d\nThere is nothing higher than the self, nothing beyond the self. What about God? God and the self being\none, even God should not be thought of as beyond or above it. Further, Brahman is not a \u201cthing\u201d in a\n\nhierarchal chain of being that It could possibly be said to be \u201cabove\u201d or \u201cbelow\u201d any thing whatsoever.\nThis statement is extremely practical, for it is impossible to conduct a spiritual life without the correct\nperspective: the spirit is supreme. Not only is everything lesser that the spirit, in truth everything else is\nnothing in comparison. Those who do not hold this conviction really have no spiritual life in the truest\nsense. God First. God Alone. This is the only correct perspective.\n\u201cDevotees seek to know him by study, by sacrifice, by continence, by austerity, by detachment. To\nknow him is to become a seer. Desiring to know him, and him alone, monks renounce the world.\nRealizing the glory of the Self, the sages of old craved not sons nor daughters. \u201cWhat have we to do\nwith sons and daughters,\u201d they asked, \u201cwe who have known the Self, we who have achieved the\nsupreme goal of existence?\u201d No longer desiring progeny, nor wealth, nor life in other worlds, they\nentered upon the path of complete renunciation.\u201d\n\u201cThe Self-Existent\u201d\nThe spirit never had a beginning. It always was. Again, this does not mean that the atman is separate\nfrom Brahman, or in any way independent of Brahman. Brahman being self-existent and eternal, so\nalso is the self. It is necessary for us to realize that NOTHING conditions or really affects the self\u2013that\nit is absolutely independent of all objects, places, or conditions. Otherwise we fall into the labyrinth of\nconfusion and false identities\n\u201cHe it is that has established perfect order among objects and beings from beginningless time\u201d\nOnce again, the unity-identity of the individual self and the Supreme Self cause the upanishadic rishi to\nmake a statement that applies to both, although we are used to thinking only in terms of the Absolute\nSelf. Really, hardly any of us\u2013being conditioned by Western religion\u2013actually believe that there is\n\u201cperfect order among objects and beings from beginningless time\u201d or at the present moment. This\nreminds me of an incident in the life of Sri Ma Anandamayi. One of those ever-present I Am Going To\nMake The World A Better Place types once remarked to her that he wanted to attain realization so he\ncould work to make the world a perfect entity. Mother instantly replied: \u201cWho do you think that it is\nnot perfect right now?\u201d And of course it is. It is a mess because we are entities that at the moment need\nto work our way through a mess! When we come to the point where order is what we need, we will be\ntransferred to an orderly world. This one will remain as it is for those students of life who also need to\nfind themselves in the midst of a mess. The world is a mirror of our mind. We may like to be Pharisees\nwho think we are not as those around us\u2013but we are. Everything we see in this world is in our mind to\nsome degree, otherwise we would not be here. If we do not like what we see, then we should change\nourselves. There is no other remedy, and there certainly is no escape from the necessity for change.\nSo it is we ourselves that have brought us into this world and provided for ourselves everything we\nneed to evolve through reacting to and solving the problems set before us. A person who whines and\npities himself does not learn and therefore is continually faced with the same situations. Have you ever\nknown the kind of person that perpetually complains about being \u201clet down\u201d by others, or those that\nhave a list of people or situations that \u201churt\u201d or cheated them? They are simply slow learners that\ndeserve no pity, for they are doing it all to themselves. Every day Theravada Buddhists monks recite\nverses of wisdom, some of which say: \u201cI have nothing but my actions; I shall never have anything but\nmy actions.\u201d There it is. Being lazy, cowardly, and egotistical, we hate these truths. But they are the\ntruth and until we face them we will keep on whirling and whining, blaming God, the universe, and\neverybody else but the real culprit: ourselves. (Note I say \u201courselves,\u201d not \u201cour selves.\u201d) Cosmic\nDestiny is determined by each one of us. God simply has nothing to do with it except for providing us\nthe environment in which we can work out our will. We can see from this that a lot of petitionary\n\nprayer and \u201csurrender to the divine will\u201d is idiotic and gets us nowhere. The day we start taking full\u2013\nand exclusive\u2013responsibility for our past, present, and future is the day we will begin moving toward\nreal perfection.\n\nPerspective on Life\nThe Full (Purna) picture\n\u201cTo darkness are they doomed who devote themselves only to life in the world, and to a greater\ndarkness they who devote themselves only to meditation. Life in the world alone leads to one result,\nmeditation alone leads to another. So have we heard from the wise. They who devote themselves both\nto life in the world and to meditation, by life in the world overcome death, and by meditation achieve\nimmortality.\u201d\nWise teachers have pointed out that even though non-duality is the actual state of things, in our present\ncondition of being netted in Maya we need to know that all is one but live as though duality is also real.\nThe world may not be ultimately real, but we need to work through the puzzles presented to us by\nrelative experience.\nTwo serious errors can be committed by the thoughtful aspirant: 1) the conclusion that since \u201cnone of it\nis real\u201d nothing really matters and there is no need for spiritual endeavor; and 2) the conclusion that\nsince only the spiritual is real we should ignore the external and the material aspects of life and put all\nour attention on the inner spiritual side of life. But right there the error is uncovered, for the spiritual is\nonly a \u201cside\u201d of life\u2013as is the material\u2013and together they make the two-sided whole. Or we can look at\nit in an even better and truer way: the material is the spiritual and therefore demands and deserves our\nfull attention as well as the obviously spiritual aspects of life. This is the meaning of the Vedic verse\nbeginning purnamadah purnamidam:\nThat is the Full, this is the Full.\nThe Full has come out of the Full.\nIf we take the Full from the Full\nIt is the Full that yet remains.\nThe two are really\u2013and always\u2013the One. To reject or turn from one is to reject and turn from the All. It\ncannot be without meaning that the bases of Sanatana Dharma\u2013the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the\nBrahma Sutras\u2013were written by sages who lived fully in the world with families and their attendant\nresponsibilities, including that of making a livelihood. Of course it was the Satya Yuga then, and\nearthly life was very different from life in our present age. Nevertheless, those who like to excuse\nthemselves from striving for self-realization by citing their involvement in \u201cthe world\u201d and worldly\nresponsibilities should consider the historical facts. (And anyway, where exactly do they think the\nmonastics are living?)\nFrom darkness to greater darkness\n\u201cTo darkness are they doomed who devote themselves only to life in the world, and to a greater\ndarkness they who devote themselves only to meditation.\u201d\nThe Purna, the Full (it also means the Complete) is one, yet it is dual. This makes no sense, but\nconsidering the limitation of our intellects that should be no surprise. It is our intuition that must come\ninto function when we begin dealing with these higher spheres of reality. We, too, are dual, being\n\nimage-replicas of the Divine Archetype. Just as God is both relative and absolute, both immanent and\ntranscendent, so are we on a miniature scale. We, too, then, must learn to function fully in both spheres,\nfor since they are essentially one, if we do not so function we will be partial, incomplete, and therefore\nfaulty rather than perfect\u2013which originally meant to be complete rather than without fault. (\u201cBe ye\ntherefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\u201d)\nOne of the fundamental errors of dualistic religion\u2013Christianity in particular\u2013is its setting of the\nmaterial against the spiritual and thereby insisting that the material must be rejected and the spiritual\nalone embraced. This produces deep spiritual psychosis, for it is simply impossible to do and also\ninvolves a rejection of an eternal part of ourselves (and God). Sanatana Dharma in contrast makes it\nclear that the two are really one and must both be cultivated\u2013according to the principles of dharma, of\ncourse\u2013for us to attain the consciousness of perfect unity in ourselves and in God.\nThose who \u201cdevote themselves only to life in the world\u201d become sunk in the limitations of materiality\nand addicted to its vagaries. Egoism and intense selfishness and exploitation of both the world and\nthose living in it with us can be the sole result of such a limited focus. Having only a perspective of\nmortality, the higher nature of the individual is suppressed to give free rein to the \u201cdog-eat-dog, everyman-for-himself\u201d attitude that must arise from preoccupation with external existence. Having no idea\nof the true nature of either the world, ourselves, or our fellow human beings, only chaos and destruction\ncan come to us.\nOn the other hand, those \u201cwho devote themselves only to meditation\u201d or abstract philosophizing to the\nexclusion of material considerations and practical living, come to a worse result: complete\npsychological disintegration (literally) and alienation from any form of reality. Hypocrisy also results,\nbecause to even eat and drink is to admit the necessity of physicality, and that food must come from\nsomewhere, so dependence on \u201cthe ignorant and astray\u201d becomes necessary. It reminds me of a cartoon\nI saw years ago in an emigre Russian newspaper just after the United States had supplied the Soviet\nUnion with incredibly huge amounts of grain and saved their economy and the life of millions. Two old\nladies were sweeping the street in Red Square. One was saying to the other: \u201cIt is good we did not kill\nall the Capitalists; otherwise we would have starved to death.\u201d How can a person justify living off those\nwhose earthly involvement they despise and condemn? The Bhagavad Gita discusses this matter\nthoroughly and points out the folly of the \u201cspirituals\u201d who pretend to have transcended worldly\nconcerns.\nWe must function in both matter and spirit. Both elements must be integrated through the following of\ndharma to complete the picture and solve the evolutionary puzzle. The material must be spiritualized\nand the spiritual must be materialized in the sense of making both practical and beneficial to one\nanother. In this endeavor the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita are indispensable, for: \u201cLife in the world\nalone leads to one result, meditation alone leads to another. So have we heard from the wise.\u201d\nFrom death to immortality\n\u201cThey who devote themselves both to life in the world and to meditation, by life in the world overcome\ndeath, and by meditation achieve immortality.\u201d\nLife is not just some maze to be somehow gotten through, or a Monopoly board with random advances\nand regressions\u2013and there is certainly no Get Out of Jail Free! Rather, life demands the fullest exercise\nof the two faculties that mark human beings out from the rest of earthly life-forms: developed reason\nand intuition. Intelligence of the highest order is necessary. This does not mean that the aspirant needs\nto be an \u201cintellectual,\u201d but he must be intelligent. Stupid people simply do not make it\u2013mostly because\nstupid people never seek it. Nor can the seeker\u2019s intelligence be kept on the shelf for only occasional\n\nuse and amusement. At all times the yogi must be keenly aware of what is going on in his life sphere\nand ever seeking to understand and work out the mystery. As already said, he needs highly developed\nintuition as well. Both these are only produced by meditation. This is because both intelligence and\nintuition (direct knowledge) are divine attributes. In the Bhagavad Gita Krishna declares himself to be\nintelligence (7:10; 10:34) and the knowledge of the mystic (9:12). In the Katha Upanishad Brahman is\nsaid to be the \u201cintelligence of the intelligent,\u201d and in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad the sage Gargya\nsays: \u201cThe being who dwells in the heart as intelligence\u2013him I meditate upon as Brahman.\u201d I am not\nspeaking of cunning or cleverness or \u201csavvy;\u201d many stupid\u2013and most evil\u2013people possess them. I am\nspeaking of the intelligence which only arises in those who are of highly evolved consciousness.\nIt is those who possess right intelligence and right intuition that can live both the inner and outer lives\nsimultaneously\u2013not first one and then the other in alternating cycles\u2013in a spiritually productive (i.e.,\nevolutionary) manner. By doing so they will accomplish two things. One: they will come to understand\nthe real meaning and purpose of all they experience and do and thereby learn the lessons for which they\ncame into relative existence. Two: they will come to experience (not just intellectually think) that the\ntwo are really one, manifestations of the One. Having seen the One in all, they have attained\nimmortality even in this mortal life.\nA final point. Notice that the upanishadic sage speak of being devoted to the outer and inner lives. This\nmeans steadiness and regularity in practice as well as adamant adherence to the required disciplines\nsuch as yama and niyama. But most important it means wanting, even loving, to lead the outer and\ninner lives according to the precepts of dharma. There is no place here for grudging admittance of\nnecessity, of stingy eking out of the barest minimum that is required, grumbling and resenting and\nwishing it need not be so. Such persons should not even try. They are not just losers, they are losses.\nSee the perspective of a Christ! Crucifixion was the most horrible of deaths, yet according to Saint\nPaul: \u201cJesus\u2026 for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame.\u201d What a\ndifferent perspective from the morbid and sentimental carryings-on over the passion of Jesus that\nChristians engage in. Loving the world and the body that links them to the world, nothing seems to\nthem more painful or tragic than the torture and death of that idol. But Jesus hastened to the mockery,\nthe scourging, and the crucifixion for the joy that was set before him. Not wonder he has been\nmisunderstood and rejected through the ages by those who bear his name.\nReinforcing the idea\n\u201cTo darkness are they doomed who worship only the body, and to greater darkness they who worship\nonly the spirit. Worship of the body alone leads to one result, worship of the spirit leads to another. So\nhave we heard from the wise. They who worship both the body and the spirit, by the body overcome\ndeath, and by the spirit achieve immortality.\u201d\nThe basic idea of these verses has already been covered, but we should notice the use of the word\n\u201cworship.\u201d We are used to thinking of worship only in relation to God, but it comes from an older form,\nworthship, which meant to acknowledge the value and significance of something. Therefore Swami\nPrabhavananda was wise in selecting this word for his translation.\nThe lesson here is the need to value both body and spirit. I know that Jesus said, \u201cNo man can serve\ntwo masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and\ndespise the other,\u201d but we are striving to be not men but gods, so we are going to have to manage it.\nAnd anyhow, we are not interesting in serving the body or the spirit but in mastering them.\nThe body is the instrument of evolution, so to despise and neglect it under the guise of spirituality is\n\nfoolish. Any machine that malfunctions should be repaired, not despised and tossed away, the body\nincluded. Also, hidden within the body are many doorways to higher consciousness. Therefore the body\nmust be worked on to become the evolutionary device it is intended to be. The first step is purification,\nand that includes two major factors: celibacy and vegetarian diet. There is no getting around it. Just\ntake a look at those who are not purifying themselves in these two ways and you will have proof\nenough. All the rationalizing and mind-gaming in the world cannot contravene the truth: brahmacharya\n(continence) and ahimsa (non-killing), are absolute essentials for those who seek higher consciousness.\nLet us take a look at what the Chandogya Upanishad tells us about food.\n\u201cFood when eaten becomes threefold. What is coarsest in it becomes faeces, what is medium becomes\nflesh and what is subtlest becomes mind. Water when drunk becomes threefold. What is coarsest in it\nbecomes urine, what is medium becomes blood and what is subtlest becomes prana. The mind, my\ndear, consists of food, the prana of water.\u201d\n\u201cThat, my dear, which is the subtlest part of curds rises, when they are churned and becomes butter. In\nthe same manner, my dear, that which is the subtlest part of the food that is eaten rises and becomes\nmind. The subtlest part of the water that is drunk rises and becomes prana. Thus, my dear, the mind\nconsists of food, the prana consists of water.\u201d\nBody and mind come from the food we eat. Thus our food must be both as pure as possible and also\nblessed by being offered to God. And the conduct of the body must be as pure as possible and its deeds\nworthy of being offered to God. Action and thought determine the quality of body and mind. Ethics and\ngood thoughts are also essential, but purity of body and mind is the crown jewel. Through these means\nboth body and spirit are truly worshipped and immortality is gained.\n\nSeeing Beyond the Sun\nUpanishadic tradition\nThe final four verses of the Isha Upanishad are recited at the cremation of bodies in India, and are a\nprayer for ascension to the higher realms that are beyond the compulsion of rebirth in this world. These\ndeal mainly with the sun. Throughout history and throughout the world the sun has been worshipped or\nconsidered a symbol of divinity. The full comprehension of the spiritual nature of the sun was\ndiscovered in India untold ages ago and embodied in the upanishads.\nLight beyond the light\n\u201cThe face of truth is hidden by thy golden orb, O Sun. That do thou remove, in order that I who am\ndevoted to truth may behold its glory.\u201d\nThe sun illumines us and shows us what we assume to be reality. But actually that \u201cseeing\u201d veils the\nTruth (Reality) behind that veil. Therefore we seek to pierce beyond it. However, the sun actually is\nthat Reality, and we must approach it and petition for the removal of its outer light in order that we may\nbehold its inner Light. (More on this later.)\nThe golden orb\nThe \u201cgolden orb\u201d has more than one meaning, all of which are significant.\n1) The most obvious meaning of the golden orb is the sun itself. All plant, animal, and human life on\nthis planet depend upon the sun. It is the subtle powers of sunlight which stimulate growth and\n\nevolution. Sunlight particularly stimulates the activity of the higher centers in the brain, especially that\nof the pineal gland. Even in the depths of the earth a sensitive man can tell when the sun rises and sets\nabove him. The sun appears to illuminate us, but it is a light that covers the Light in order to lead us to\nthe Light. We must use it to go beyond it.\n2) All things have an inner and outer life, and that includes the sun. We may say that there is the outer\nsun of the material universe, and there is also the metaphysical sun of the psychic universe. They\noperate simultaneously, being the same thing. The sun truly awakens us in the deepest sense. As the\ngerminating seed struggles upward toward the sun and out into its life-giving rays, so all higher forms\nof life reach out for the sun, which acts as a metaphysical magnet, drawing them upward and outward\ntoward ever-expanding consciousness. The Chandogya Upanishad discusses it in this way: \u201cEven as a\ngreat extending highway runs between two villages, this one and that yonder, even so the rays of the\nsun go to both these worlds, this one and that yonder. They start from the yonder sun and enter into the\nnadis. They start from the nadis and enter into the yonder sun.\u2026When a man departs from this body,\nthen he goes upwards by these very rays or he goes up with the thought of Om. As his mind is failing,\nhe goes to the sun. That, verily, is the gateway of the world, an entering in for the knowers, a shutting\nout for the non-knowers.\u201d\nThe solar rays do not just flow into this world, they also draw upward through the sun and beyond. In\nthe human body the process of exhalation and inhalation is related to solar energy, and much of the\nsolar power on which we subsist is drawn into the body through our breathing. The solar rays do not\njust strike the surface of our body, but actually penetrate into the physical nerves (nadis). The nadis are\nalso the channels in the astral body that correspond to the physical nerves. Just as the electrical\nimpulses flow through the physical nerves, the subtle life force, or prana, flows through the subtle nadis\nand keeps us alive and functioning. The prana, then, is a vehicle for the solar energies that produce\nevolution.\nWhen the individual comes into manifestation on this earth he passes from the astral world into the\nmaterial plane by means of the sun, which is a mass of exploding astral energies, not mere flaming\ngases. And when the individual has completed his course of evolution within this plane, upon the death\nof his body he rises upward in his subtle body and passes through the sun into the higher worlds, there\nto evolve even higher or to pass directly into the depths of the transcendent Brahman.\n3) The golden orb is also the entire creation, the means by which through experience the individual\nspirits can evolve to perfect conscious union with God. Without it we would be unable to attain that\nunion. Yet, just as we use a ladder or stair to ascend and then step beyond it, in the same way the\ncreation is meant to be eventually transcended. We must therefore keep both these aspects in mind\nwhile living in this world.\n4) The golden orb is also our own mind\u2013that which perceives the world around us and the intelligence\nwhich comprehends what is going on and directs our lives accordingly. Potential is not enough; there\nmust be actualization. It is our mind alone that can lead us beyond the mind, our intelligence alone that\ncan lead us onward to intuition. At all stages the mind and intelligence are \u201cgolden,\u201d but if we allow\nourselves to become stagnated at any point they rapidly \u201ctarnish\u201d and turn from beneficial to harmful.\nImmersed in this creation, we are like the fish that must keep perpetually moving for they will die of\nsuffocation if they come to a standstill. If we do not move forward we shall move backward\u2013and often\nmistake it for progress. We must Get On and Get Beyond.\n5) Our own self (atman) is also the golden orb. We must come to know our self\u2013our true self\u2013and\ndelight in the self and wonder at its nature. But that is not enough. We must then pass onward to\n\nexperience the Self of our self, the Paramatman. In a sense we transcend the self\u2013but of course we do\nnot, since the Supreme Self and our individual self are one. This transcendence must ever be kept in\nmind, for out of ignorance and even laziness a lot of people like the idea that we need only enter into\nthe experience of our self and that is the end. The same wrong-headed view abrogates the need for our\nevolution and assumes that if we must smash the machine we will get the picture\u2013or even worse, that\nthere is no picture to see or even a seer to see it. However cleverly this view may be worded or how\nsophisticated it appears, it is nihilism of the deadliest sort, a ruinous pitfall.\n6) The golden orb is also the evolutionary impulse within all things which, though life itself to the\nevolving spirit, yet urges us to continual transcendence of its various stages until we transcend it as\nwell. It is a golden stair that urges us onward to the heights where it cannot come.\nThe Supreme Sun\nThe ultimate Golden Orb is the Supreme Self. That is what we are striving toward by the five means\njust cited. Being transcendent, how shall we reach it? By means of Its immanence within the world in\nthe form of the sacred syllable Om, the Pranava, the Life-giver.\n\u201cThat which glows [i.e., the sun] is Om,\u201d says the ancient Aitareya-Brahmana (5.32). The lifeproducing energies of the sun are the energies of Om. Om is the sun of body, mind, and spirit, the LifeGiver of all. All plant, animal, and human life on this planet depends upon the sun. It is the subtle\npowers of sunlight which stimulate growth and evolution, awakening us in the deepest sense. Sunlight\nis the radiant form of Om. The sun initiates the entire solar system into Om. Human beings are solar\ncreatures, therefore to intone Om is the most natural thing they can do.\n\u201cNow, verily, what is the udgitha is the Om. What is Om is the udgitha. And so verily, the udgitha is the\nyonder sun and the Om, for the sun is continually sounding \u2018Om.\u2019\u201d The most significant part of this\nverse is the statement that \u201cthe sun is continually sounding \u2018Om,\u2019\u201d indicating that the evolutionary\nenergy of the sun is a manifestation of Om. Our life depends on the light of the sun, thus our life is also\na manifestation of the power of Om. The japa and meditation of Om aligns us with the solar powers\nthat are Om and thereby greatly increase our life force and the evolution of all the levels of our being.\n\u201cEven as a great extending highway runs between two villages, this one and that yonder, even so the\nrays of the sun go to both these worlds, this one and that yonder. They start from the yonder sun and\nenter into the nadis [astral \u201cnerves\u201d]. They start from the nadis and enter into the yonder sun.\u2026When a\nman departs from this body, then he goes upwards by these very rays or he goes up with the thought of\nOm. As his mind is failing, he goes to the sun. That, verily, is the gateway of the world, an entering in\nfor the knowers, a shutting out for the non-knowers.\u201d We have already cited this, but there are more\nmeanings for us to explore. The prana, the breath, is a vehicle for the solar energies that produce\nevolution, and so we join Om to our breathing and merge it into the pranic flow. This practice\nconditions our subtle levels so that at the time of death we will be oriented toward the solar powers and\ncan ascend upon them\u2013especially if we continue our intonations of Om even after the body has been\ndropped. Those intonations will guarantee our ascent into the solar world. Those who have imbued\nthemselves with the Pranavic vibrations will enter through the solar gate, whereas those who have not\ndone so will be shut out by it and compelled to return to earthly rebirth.\n\u201cBy means of Om he [the meditating yogi] sees the way, the way along which his prana goes; therefore\none should always repeat It so that he goes along the right way: through the heart-gate, the air-gate, the\ngate which leads upward, and the opening of the gate of liberation which is known as the open orb [the\nsun.]\u201d Those who continually invoke and meditate upon Om during their lifetime will remember Om at\nthe time of death, and by means of Om will ascend to the sun and beyond into the real Beyond.\n\n\u201c\u2018It is said: \u2018Indeed the sun is this Om;\u2019 therefore one should meditate and make himself ready to unite\nhimself with it.\u201d Sunlight is the radiant form of Om. The sun initiates the entire solar system into Om.\nHuman beings are solar creatures, therefore to intone Om is the most natural things they can do.\n\u201cAt the time of departure from this world, remember Om, the Lord, the Protector\u201d says the Yajur Veda.\nKrishna states in the Bhagavad Gita: \u201cAt the hour of death, when a man leaves his body, he must depart\nwith his consciousness absorbed in Me. Then he will be united with Me. Be certain of that. Whatever a\nman remembers at the last, when he is leaving the body, will be realized by him in the hereafter;\nbecause that will be what his mind has most constantly dwelt on, during this life. Therefore you must\nremember Me at all times, and do your duty. If your mind and heart are set upon Me constantly, you\nwill come to Me. Never doubt this. Make a habit of practicing meditation, and do not let your mind be\ndistracted. In this way you will come finally to the Lord, Who is the light-giver, the highest of the\nhigh.\u201d Whatever we think of most during life we will think of at the time of our death, and that will\ndetermine our subsequent state. Those who continually invoke and meditate upon Om during their\nlifetime will remember Om at the time of death, and by means of Om will ascend to the sun and\nbeyond into the real Beyond.\nQualified seers\nSimply wanting a thing does not make it happen or come to us. In the same way, spiritual daydreaming\nis fruitless. Therefore, he who petitions for the removal of the golden orb describes himself as \u201cI who\nam devoted to truth.\u201d He is one who wishes to pass from the unreal to the Real, to no longer live in the\nmagic of Maya, but to move onward to the Reality behind all appearance. And he does not just seek\ntruth or think about it\u2013he is devoted to truth. Only those \u201cmay behold its glory.\u201d\nStop! so I may Go\n\u201cO nourisher, only seer, controller of all\u2014O illumining Sun, fountain of life for all creatures\u2013withhold\nthy light, gather together thy rays. May I behold through thy grace thy most blessed form. The Being\nthat dwells therein even that Being am I.\u201d\nIn Indian philosophy God is often thought of as Mother. This verse bears that out, speaking of the\ndivine as the Nourisher of all beings, the Fountain of Life. God the Mother is frequently addressed in\nSanskrit hymns as Jagata Janani, Jagata Palani\u2013the Birthgiver and Nourisher of the world (jagat). In\nEastern Christianity, one title given to the Virgin Mother Mary is \u201cLife-giving Spring.\u201d God is also the\nSeer of All, the Ruler of All, as this verse indicates.\nThe petitioner then makes an interesting request: \u201cWithhold thy light, gather together thy rays.\u201d How is\nthis? Why does he not ask that the light should flood down upon him? Because the \u201clight\u201d he is\nspeaking of is not the Absolute Light, but the light of relative existence which by its nature veils that\nUltimate Light. He asks, then, that God withdraw the light of temporality in order that he might behold\nand enter into the Light of Eternity.\nThis has a yogic aspect, as well. We must withdraw all the scattered \u201crays\u201d of our energies and\nawareness and unite them to our inmost consciousness. We must gather up that which is dispersed and\nfragmented and restore our original state of unity. Meditation is the only way this can be accomplished.\nThe vision\n\u201cMay I behold through thy grace thy most blessed form.\u201d Two questions arise (or should arise) at these\nwords. What is the grace of God? What is the form of God?\n\nThe grace of God is not some kind of favor or \u201cgoodie\u201d dropped into our lap by God. Nor is grace\nsomething occasionally dispensed by God as a special token to the chosen. All that exists\u2013either\nrelatively or absolutely\u2013is the grace of God. There is nothing that is not the grace of God. If we like,\nwe may say that the grace of God is the Divine Plan for our liberation. And the creation, gross and\nsubtle, is the means for the realization of that Plan, and is itself Grace Divine. So to petition God for\ngrace is as silly as fish in the ocean praying for water. It is inseparable from us! The grace through\nwhich we behold God is the great onward movement initiated by God at the inception of the cosmos.\nThe Form of God is not a form such as that experienced in relative existence, but is the Substance, the\nLight, from which all forms arise. It can be said to be formless, and yet all forms exist within it\neternally. As Sri Ma Anandamayi frequently said: \u201cNothing is lost There.\u201d The Form \u201cof\u201d God IS God.\nWhen we see God we also see ourselves in God and can then declare: \u201cThe Being that dwells therein\neven that Being am I.\u201d\n\u201cThen Satyakama, son of Shibi, asked him [the Rishi Pippalada]: \u2018Venerable Sir, what world does he\nwho meditates on Om until the end of his life, win by That?\u2019 To him, he said: \u2018That which is the sound\nOm, O Satyakama, is verily the higher and the lower Brahman. Therefore, with this support alone does\nthe wise man reach the one or the other.\u2019\u2026If he meditates on the Supreme Being [Parampurusha] with\nthe Syllable Om, he becomes one with the Light, the Sun. He is led to the world of Brahman. He sees\nthe Person that dwells in the body, Who is higher than the highest life.\u2026That the wise one attains, even\nby the mere sound Om as support, That Which is tranquil, unaging, immortal, fearless, and supreme.\u201d\n\nThe Final Aspiration\nThe poet Browning wrote of \u201cthe end of life for which the first was made.\u201d That is a lovely expression,\nbut very few really believe it and therefore rarely think of their life\u2019s end. Those of us who seek\nliberation must from the very beginning be looking toward the end we desire. In the next to the last\nverse at the close of the Isha Upanishad we are given the perspective we should be living with every\nmoment of our life if we would truly \u201ccome to a good end.\u201d\nNow\n\u201cLet my life now merge in the all-pervading life. Ashes are my body\u2019s end. OM\u2026.O mind, remember\nBrahman. O mind, remember thy past deeds. Remember Brahman. Remember thy past deeds.\u201d\nEmily Dickenson wrote: \u201cWhile others hope to go to heaven at last, I am going all along!\u201d This is the\nonly way for those who would succeed in spiritual life. Nothing should be delayed for the future\u2013it is\nall now or not at all. \u201cBehold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation\u201d\nThere are many partially awakened people who know that God is the only real goal. Yet they delay\ntheir endeavor. \u201cAfter I get this,\u201d they say, \u201cthen I will really dig in and seek God.\u201d But they never do,\nfor as soon as one little short-term goal is reached another arises that seems even more demanding. I\nknow a woman that claimed she would intensely seek God the day after her only child graduated from\nhigh school. But then it became after his graduating from college. Then after he was married and\n\u201creally settled down.\u201d Death found her anticipating still another \u201cafter which,\u201d but it was all over. And\nby her foolishness she had created in her mind the habit of postponing spiritual life, a habit that will\nsurely carry over into the next life and perhaps into others.\nHow often do we think that the vision of God will somehow interfere with our life\u2013when in reality we\n\nhave no life outside that vision. Silly children, we dawdle and dally until the night falls, that \u201cnight in\nwhich no man can work\u201d which Jesus warned us about. \u201cNow or never\u201d happens to be the simple truth.\nMerging in Life\nMany people want to \u201cembrace life\u201d so they can egocentrically possess it and exploit it to the full. But\nthey have no idea what life is. Just the opposite, for what they think is life is really death. \u201cThe allpervading life\u201d is the only life, for that is God. And the necessity is not to find or see God as an object\n(again, to possess), but to merge with God in complete unity-identity. That is, our consciousness must\nbe completely merged in the infinite Consciousness, and irrevocably so. Just as a cup of water poured\ninto the ocean cannot be drawn back out of the ocean, so we need to attain that state of unity which can\nnever be reversed. Many yogis paddle their feet or go for a quick dip in the ocean of Satchidananda, but\nthe goal is to unite with that ocean, to merge in it and become totally one with it. Consequently at ever\nmoment of our life we must be holding in mind and living out the sankalpa: \u201cLet my life now merge in\nthe all-pervading life.\u201d\nThose who are unfit for union with God become all anxious and even fearful when they hear about\nmerging with the Divine. \u201cO! will I go out of existence?\u201d they quaver. \u201cWhat will happen to me?\u201d Over\nand over again they plunge headlong into the sea of rebirth, never raising such questions about relative\nexistence, but \u201cgoing for it\u201d heedlessly. Only when confronted with God do they develop prudence and\ncaution. Jesus has assured us, though: \u201cWhosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and\nwhosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.\u201d This is because we are truly negative\u2013that is, we are\nabsolutely backwards one hundred and eighty degrees. Consequently what we think will annihilate us\nwill immortalize us, whereas what we think will make us live will destroy us.\nLike the great master, Yogananda, we must pray: \u201cLet me drown in Thine ocean and live!\u201d\nUnderstanding the destiny of the body\nIt is not a simple thing to rid ourselves of the conditionings of billions of lives wherein we identified\ncompletely with the body. Even when we have evolved enough to identify more with the mind and the\nspirit, still the body claims the majority of our attention\u2013and attachment. It is completely reflexive with\nus, overriding any emotional or intellectual factors to the contrary. Therefore we must continually\naffirm in word, attitude, and act: \u201cAshes are my body\u2019s end.\u201d This will only seem painful or pessimistic\nif we are still identifying with the body. But if not, it will be as happy a statement as an affirmation that\nour prison is going to evaporate into dust.\nWe have died many times (or thought we did), but that did not free us at all. And in many lives we were\nno doubt cremated. Still, that accomplished nothing. Evidently there is a deeper meaning to the \u201cashes\u201d\nthat are the body\u2019s end. It is the fire of wisdom that turns our \u201cbodies\u201d into ashes. Let us then be busy\nstoking the fires of yoga and getting on with the burning. Sadhus wear gerua, orange-red color, to\nremind them of the fire of discrimination and spirit-knowledge that must be perpetually burning in\norder to reduce all that impels us into embodiment to the ashes of freedom.\nFlying from fear,\nFrom lust and anger,\nHe hides in me\nHis refuge, his safety:\nBurnt clean in the blaze of my being,\nIn me many find home.\n\nThe blazing fire turns wood to ashes:\nThe fire of knowledge turns all karmas to ashes.\nWhen the \u201cbridges\u201d of all bodies, subtle and gross, have been burned in the holy fires, then we will\npass on into the kingdom of Infinity that is our eternal birthright.\nRemember!\nHow to kindle the ignorance-consuming fire? The upanishadic sage continues: \u201cO mind, remember\nBrahman. O mind, remember thy past deeds. Remember Brahman. Remember thy past deeds.\u201d\n\u201cRemember Brahman\u201d is extremely easy to say, but how is it done? The Upanishads do not waste our\ntime, but go straight to the mark, saying:\n\u201cI will tell you briefly of that Goal which all the Vedas with one voice propound, which all the\nausterities speak of, and wishing for Which people practice discipline: It is Om.\u201d\n\u201cOm is the Supreme Brahman.\u201d\n\u201cGod is the Syllable Om.\u201d\n\u201cOm is Brahman, the Primeval Being.\u201d\n\u201cThat [Om] is the quintessence of the essences, the Supreme, the highest.\u201d\n\u201cOm is Brahman.\u201d\nAfter the battle of Kurukshetra, before which he had spoken the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna again spoke to\nArjuna at length. In that conversation he told him: \u201cThe gods, rishis, and the nagas, and the asuras,\napproaching Prajapati [the Creator], said to Him: \u2018Tell us the highest good.\u2019 To them who were\ninquiring about the highest good, the Venerable One said, \u2018Om, which is Brahman in a single\nSyllable.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe monosyllable Om is the highest Brahman,\u201d said the sage Manu, and Patanjali summed it all up by\nsimply saying: \u201cIts repetition and meditation is the way.\u201d\nTo remember Brahman we engage in the japa and meditation of Om\u2013simple and direct.\n\u201cOne should meditate on this Syllable [Om].\u201d\n\u201cThis [Om] is the best means [of attainment and realization]; this means is the Higher and Lesser\nBrahman. Meditating on Om, one becomes worthy of worship in the world of Brahman.\u201d\n\u201cThe Self [atman] is of the nature of the Syllable Om. Thus the Syllable Om is the very Self. He who\nknows It thus enters the Self [Supreme Spirit] with his self [individual spirit].\u201d\n\u201cTaking as the bow the great weapon of the Upanishads [Om], one should place in It the arrow\nsharpened by meditation. Drawing It with a mind engaged in the contemplation of That [Brahman], O\nbeloved, know that Imperishable Brahman as the target. The Syllable Om is the bow: one\u2019s self, indeed,\nis the arrow. Brahman is spoken of as the target of that. It is to be hit without making a mistake. Thus\none becomes united with it [Brahman] as the arrow becomes one with the target. He in Whom the sky,\nthe earth, and the interspace are woven, as also the mind along with all the pranas, know Him alone as\nthe one Self. Dismiss other utterances. This [Om] is the bridge to immortality. Meditate on Om as the\n\nSelf. May you be successful in crossing over to the farther shore of darkness.\u201d\n\u201cThen Satyakama, son of Shibi, asked him [the Rishi Pippalada]: \u2018Venerable Sir, what world does he\nwho meditates on Om until the end of his life, win by That?\u2019 To him, he said: \u2018If he meditates on the\nSupreme Being [Parampurusha] with the Syllable Om, he becomes one with the Light, the Sun. He is\nled to the world of Brahman. He sees the Person that dwells in the body, Who is higher than the highest\nlife.\u2026That the wise one attains, even by the mere sound Om as support, That Which is tranquil,\nunaging, immortal, fearless, and supreme.\u201d\n\u201cThe knower of the real nature of Brahman that is identical with the Pranava, should cross all the\nformidable streams [of samsara] with the ferryboat of the Pranava.\u201d\n\u201cHe who utters Om with the intention \u2018I shall attain Brahman\u2019 does verily attain Brahman.\u201d\nAlternating remembrance\nThe thorough practicality and good sense of dharma is one of its most striking features: it works. And it\nworks very well. So it is meaningful that the upanishad tells us to remember Brahman, then remember\nour own past deeds, then remember Brahman, and then remember our own past deeds in a kind of\nalternating current. This is to keep us from falling into two serious errors: 1) being so focused on the\n\u201cspiritual\u201d that we do not pay attention to what is really going on with us, and 2) becoming so obsessed\nwith ourselves that we utterly leave God out of the picture. Patanjali lists swadhyaya\u2013introspective selfstudy\u2013as an essential ingredient of yoga practice. Yet this self-study must be done in the greater context\nof divine consciousness: \u201cIn thy light shall we see light.\u201d Only in the divine light can we see things as\nthey really are.\nSo we should meditate on Brahman through Om, and outside of meditation we should look at our past,\ncomparing our past deeds and our past states of mind with our present deeds and mental condition. This\nwill reveal to us whether we are truly progressing or not. I knew a woman who sincerely believed that\nGod was appearing to her in meditation and talking to her so sweetly, making her feel so holy and pure.\nThen she would come out of meditation and be unspeakably cruel to her daughter, both physically and\nmentally. In meditation she was an angel, but outside of meditation she was a devil. Wrong meditation\ngives us a wrong image of ourselves, but right meditation shows us the truth about both God and\nourselves.\nOf course we have to have a correct memory of our past. Many people are so blinded to the truth about\nthemselves that when they learn to meditate they start saying: \u201cMy mind used to be calm, but it has\ngotten so restless,\u201d or: \u201cI used to be a nice person, but now I am just a wreck and falling apart.\u201d The\nreality is that their mind was always restless, but not being introspective they did not realize it. They\nwere also a complete ruin, mentally and spiritually, but they had no eyes with which to see it. Now they\ndo, and they foolishly blame meditation. On the other hand, people who are practicing a wrong form of\nmeditation (or a right form wrongly) do become increasingly restless and increasingly negative. I know\nof several kinds of meditation that really do bring about the mental and spiritual disintegration of those\nwho practice them, and often the physical degeneration, as well. But those who meditate according to\nthe teachings of the upanishads will have no problem.\nEnd of Isha Commentary",
    "Kena": "\n\nKena Upanishad\nTranslated by Vidyavachaspati V. Panoli\nOm ! May my limbs, speech, vital air, eyes, ears, strength,\nAnd all the senses be fully developed.\nAll that is revealed by the Upanishads is Brahman.\nMay I never deny Brahman:\nMay Brahman never disown me.\nLet there be no repudiation (from Brahman);\nLet there be no infidelity from my side.\nMay all the Dharmas extolled by the Upanishads shine in me\nWho am intent on knowing the Self.\nMay they shine in me !\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nI-1. Wished by whom is the mind directed to fall (on its objects)? Directed by whom does the foremost\nvital air move? By whom is wished this speech which the people utter? Who is the radiant being that\nunites the eye and the ear (with their objects)?\nI-2. Because He is the ear of the ear, the mind of the mind, the speech of speech, the vital air of the vital\nair, and the eye of the eye, the wise, freeing themselves (from the identity with the senses) and\n\nrenouncing the world, become immortal.\nI-3. The eye does not reach there, nor speech, nor mind, nor do we know (Its mature). Therefore we\ndon\u2019t know how to impart instruction (about It). Distinct indeed is That from the known and distinct\nfrom the unknown. Thus have we heard from the ancients who expounded It to us.\nI-4. That which is not uttered by speech, that by which the word is expressed, know That alone to be\nBrahman, and not this (non-Brahman) which is being worshiped.\nI-5. That which one does not think with the mind, that by which, they say, the mind is thought, know\nThat alone to be Brahman, and not this (non-Brahman) which is being worshiped.\nI-6. That which man does not see with the eye, that by which man sees the activities of the eye, know\nThat alone to be Brahman, and not this (non-Brahman) which is being worshiped.\nI-7. That which man does not hear with the ear, that by which man hears the ear\u2019s hearing, know That\nalone to be Brahman, and not this (non-Brahman) which is being worshiped.\nI-8. That which man does not smell with the organ of smell, that by which the organ of smell is\nattracted towards its objects, know That alone to be Brahman, and not this (non-Brahman) which is\nbeing worshiped.\nII-1. If you think, \u2018I know Brahman rightly\u2019, you have known but little of Brahman\u2019s (true) nature.\nWhat you know of His form and what form you know among the gods (too is but little). Therefore\nBrahman is still to be inquired into by you. I think Brahman is known to me.\nII-2. I think not I know Brahman rightly, nor do I think It is unknown. I know (and I do not know also).\nHe among us who knows that knows It (Brahman); not that It is not known nor that It is known.\nII-3. It is known to him to whom It is unknown; he to whom It is known does not know It. It is\nunknown to those who know, and known to those who know not.\nII-4. When Brahman is known as the inner Self (of cognition) in every state of consciousness, It is\nknown in reality, because one thus attains immortality. Through one\u2019s own Self is attained strength and\nthrough knowledge is attained immortality.\nII-5. Here if one has realized, then there is accomplishment. Here if one has not realized, then there is\nutter ruin. Having realized Brahman in all beings, and having withdrawn from this world, the wise\nbecome immortal.\nIII-1. It is well-known that Brahman indeed achieved victory for the gods. But in that victory which\nwas Brahman\u2019s the gods reveled in joy.\nIII-2. They thought, \u201cOurs alone is this victory, ours alone is this glory\u201d. Brahman knew this their pride\nand appeared before them, but they knew not who this Yaksha (worshipful Being) was.\nIII-3. They said to Agni: \u201cO Jataveda, know thou this as to who this Yaksha is\u201d. (He said:) \u201cSo be it.\u201d\nIII-4. Agni approached It. It asked him, \u201cWho art thou?\u201d He replied, \u201cI am Agni or I am Jataveda\u201d.\nIII-5. (It said:) \u201cWhat is the power in thee, such as thou art?\u201d (Agni said:) \u201cI can burn all this that is\nupon the earth.\u201d\nIII-6. For him (It) placed there a blade of grass and said: \u201cBurn this\u201d. (Agni) went near it in all haste,\nbut he could not burn it. He returned from there (and said:) \u201cI am unable to understand who that Yaksha\nis\u201d.\nIII-7. Then (the gods) said to Vayu: \u201cO Vayu, know thou this as to who this Yaksha is\u201d. (He said:) \u201cSo\nbe it\u201d.\nIII-8. Vayu approached It. It said to him, \u201cWho art thou?\u201d He replied, \u201cI am Vayu or I am Matarsiva\u201d.\nIII-9. (It said:) \u201cWhat is the power in thee, such as thou art?\u201d (Vayu said:) \u201cI can take hold of all this\nthat is upon the earth\u201d.\nIII-10. For him (It) placed there a blade of grass and said: \u201cTake this up\u201d. (Vayu) went near it in all\nhaste, but he could not take it up. He returned from there (and said:) \u201cI am unable to understand who\nthat Yaksha is\u201d.\n\nIII-11. Then (the gods) said to Indra: \u201cO Maghava, know thou this as to who this Yaksha is\u201d. (He said:)\n\u201cSo be it\u201d. He approached It, but It disappeared from him.\nIII-12. In that space itself (where the Yaksha had disappeared) Indra approached an exceedingly\ncharming woman. To that Uma decked in gold (or to the daughter of the Himalayas), he said: \u201cWho is\nthis Yaksha?\u201d\nIV-1. She said: \u201cIt was Brahman. In the victory that was Brahman\u2019s you were reveling in joy\u201d. Then\nalone did Indra know for certain that It was Brahman.\nIV-2. Therefore, these gods viz. Agni, Vayu and Indra excelled other gods, for they touched Brahman\nwho stood very close and indeed knew first that It was Brahman.\nIV-3. Therefore is Indra more excellent than the other gods, for he touched Brahman who stood very\nclose and indeed knew first that It was Brahman.\nIV-4. Its instruction (regarding meditation) is this. It is similar to that which is like a flash of lightning\nor like the winkling of the eye. This is (the analogy of Brahman) in the divine aspect.\nIV-5. Then (follows) the instruction through analogy on the aspect of the individual self. (It is wellknown that) the mind seems to attain to It, that It is continually remembered by the mind, and that the\nmind possesses the thought (regarding It).\nIV-6. That Brahman is known indeed as Tadvana (worshipful or adorable to all beings); That is to be\nworshiped as Tadvana. To him who knows It thus verily all beings pray.\nIV-7. (Disciple:) \u201cRevered sir, speak Upanishad to me.\u201d (Teacher:) \u201cI have spoken Upanishad to thee.\nOf Brahman verily is the Upanishad that I have spoken.\u201d\nIV-8. Of this knowledge austerity, self-restraint and action are the feet, the Vedas are all limbs and truth\nis the abode.\nIV-9. He who knows this thus, with his sins destroyed, becomes firmly seated in the infinite, blissful\nand supreme Brahman. He becomes firmly seated (in Brahman).\nOm ! May my limbs, speech, vital air, eyes, ears, strength,\nAnd all the senses be fully developed.\nAll that is revealed by the Upanishads is Brahman.\nMay I never deny Brahman:\nMay Brahman never disown me.\nLet there be no repudiation (from Brahman);\nLet there be no infidelity from my side.\nMay all the Dharmas extolled by the Upanishads shine in me\nWho am intent on knowing the Self.\nMay they shine in me !\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Kenapanishad, as contained in the Sama-Veda.\n\nKena Upanishad Commentary\nCommentary on the Kena Upanishad\u2013by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\nThe Mover of the Moved\nIn the world we see a prime duality: cause and effect. Yet, we see no cause for the world itself. Inquiry\ninto its cause naturally arises. The lazy and the cowardly insist there is no cause and pursue their\nexploitation of the world and its inhabitants. The worthy and the bold, however, seek to know. Many\nare the theories set forth by profound thinkers. But those who have gone beyond thought into pure\nknowing have unanimously told us of the cause, and in that insight have also come to perfectly\nunderstand the effect\u2013the world and all within it.\nThe question\nThe Kena Upanishad opens with a question that is answered in the rest of the upanishad.\n\u201cAt whose behest does the mind think? Who bids the body live? Who makes the tongue speak? Who is\nthat effulgent Being that directs the eye to form and color and the ear to sound?\u201d\nThis is one of the few philosophical questions that really matter, for if we come to the wrong\nconclusion it will cloud, or even distort, our understanding of life. For example, if we say God, or\nNature, or happenstance, we will in essence be saying that we have nothing to do with our existence,\nthat a force far beyond us is making all this occur to us, that we are like seaweed being carried along on\nthe wave of the sea, able to yearn for situations and things but unable to bring anything about. If we are\ntheists we believe that if we somehow do the needful, in response God will give us what we want, but\nstill it will be his doing and beyond our capacity to accomplish or even hold on to once we have it. This\nview of ourselves as utterly helpless and therefore utterly insignificant in the vast universe will cripple\nand frustrate us, distorting us profoundly. You Are Nothing becomes the watchword of our life\u2013a life\nwhich bears that maxim out. Hopeless and helpless we drift along, controlled by everything that is\nother than us. This is truly a living hell.\nInto this darkness shines the realization embodied in the upanishads, a realization that we will\nsomehow recognize from deep within us, for that realization is ours on the inmost level of our\nexistence. We do not learn the truth\u2013we recognize it.\nAll right, then: who makes the mind think, the body live, the faculty of speech to manifest, and causes\nthe senses to operate?\nThe answer\n\n\u201cThe Self is ear of the ear, mind of the mind, speech of speech. He is also breath of the breath, and eye\nof the eye. Having given up the false identification of the Self with the senses and the mind, and\nknowing the Self to be Brahman, the wise, on departing this life, become immortal.\u201d\nThe ear, mind, speech, breath, and eye are only instruments, only messengers. The one who causes\nthem to function, the hearer of hearing, the witness of the mind and thought, the understander of\nspeech, the source of the breath and the seer of seeing, is the Atman, the Self. External experience may\nbe illusory, but if we trace the illusion back and back to the perceiver of perception we will find the\nreality that is the Self. In a motion picture we see so many images, so many illusions, but when the\npicture stops we see the pure white screen that was behind it all the time, without which no picture\nwould have been possible. Such is the Self. Knowing the Self to be none other than Brahman, the\nAbsolute, rebirth is no more.\nSwami Prabhavananda has translated the word dhira as \u201cthe wise,\u201d but in actuality dhira means those\nwho are steadfast\u2013in this instance those who are firmly established in the practice of yoga and in the\nrealization arising from yoga.\nBrahman the inexpressible\nBrahman is beyond all sensory perception or intellectual comprehension. Yet we can infer the existence\nof Brahman by that which It causes to occur, by the consciousness that does perceive and comprehend.\nSo in conclusion the upanishad says this, which really needs little comment:\n\u201cHim the eye does not see, nor the tongue express, nor the mind grasp. Him we neither know nor are\nable to teach.\n\u201cDifferent is he from the known, and different is he from the unknown. So have we heard from the\nwise.\n\u201cThat which cannot be expressed in words but by which the tongue speaks know that to be Brahman.\nBrahman is not the being who is worshiped of men.\n\u201cThat which is not comprehended by the mind but by which the mind comprehends\u2013know that to be\nBrahman. Brahman is not the being who is worshiped of men.\n\u201cThat which is not seen by the eye but by which the eye sees\u2013know that to be Brahman. Brahman is not\nthe being who is worshiped of men.\n\u201cThat which is not heard by the ear but by which the ear hears\u2013know that to be Brahman. Brahman is\nnot the being who is worshiped of men.\n\u201cThat which is not drawn by the breath but by which the breath is drawn know that to be Brahman.\nBrahman is not the being who is worshiped of men.\u201d\nWhen the upanishad says that we do not know Brahman, it refers to intellectual knowledge. Therefore,\nas it continues, we cannot \u201cteach\u201d Brahman as an intellectual subject.\nWhen it says that Brahman is different \u201cfrom the unknown\u201d it is not speaking of Brahman\u2019s\nunknowability, but rather that Brahman is not an unknown object that in time the intellect will come to\nknow.\nThe most striking part of this passage is the statement that \u201cBrahman is not the being who is worshiped\nof men.\u201d This presents two significant points. First, that Brahman is not an object, but the Eternal\n\nSubject, and consequently cannot be worshiped as an object. Second, \u201cmen\u201d cannot relate to Brahman\nat all, but those that have passed beyond all relative identity can experience Brahman as their own Self.\n\nKnowing that is Ignorance, and Unknowing\nThat is Knowing\nAt the beginning\nAll classical commentators say that in this second part of the Kena Upanishad the first two verses are a\ndialogue between a teacher and a student, and the remaining three verses are an exposition of the\ndiscussion. First, the teacher says to the student:\n\u201cIf you think that you know well the truth of Brahman, know that you know little. What you think to be\nBrahman in your self, or what you think to be Brahman in the gods\u2013that is not Brahman. What is\nindeed the truth of Brahman you must therefore learn.\u201d\nThe student responds:\n\u201cI cannot say that I know Brahman fully. Nor can I say that I know him not. He among us knows him\nbest who understands the spirit of the words: \u201cNor do I know that I know him not.\u201d\nTo help us in this, here is the translation of Swami Gambhirananda:\n\u201c[Teacher:] If you think, \u2018I have known Brahman well enough,\u2019 then you have known only the very\nlittle expression that It has in the human body and the little expression that It has among the gods.\nTherefore Brahman is still to be deliberated on by you.\n\u201cStudent:] \u2018I think [Brahman] is known. I do not think, \u201cI know [Brahman] well enough;\u201d [i.e. I\nconsider] \u201cNot that I do not know: I know and I do not know as well.\u201d He among us who understands\nthat utterance, \u201cNot that I do not know. I Know and I do not know as well,\u201d knows that [Brahman].\u2019\u201d\nThat may have only compounded the bewilderment, but we can untangle it with patience. These verses\nare excellent examples of the difficulty we have when we try to speak the Unspeakable and explain the\nUnexplainable.\nAn easy mistake\nBrahman is not only everywhere, but actually is all things. (This, too, we cannot exactly comprehend,\nand to express it simplistically is to make things much worse.) Because of this, it is easy for those who\nhave experienced only a hint of Brahman\u2013even a hint of Which is tremendous\u2013to say: \u201cNow I know\nBrahman.\u201d But that would be like someone who has seen a cup of seawater saying: \u201cNow I have seen\nthe Sea.\u201d If we do not know Brahman fully, we cannot truly say that we know Brahman at all. Yet,\nthere is a knowing that is beyond the intellect and is both knowing and unknowing in an experiential\nsense. This is why a medieval mystical English text on the knowledge of God is called The Cloud of\nUnknowing. When we know Brahman we know that It cannot known in the human sense of knowing.\nThe same concept is held in Eastern Christianity, where it is said that God cannot be seen, but you must\nsee God to realize that He cannot be seen.\nIs all this said to confuse and mystify us? No; but it does have the purpose of our giving up the\nhopeless attempt to comprehend Brahman intellectually.\n\nSo the teacher says that to think we know Brahman when we have just glimpsed a hint of Its existence\nis a mistake. The clever student, however, points out that we can dimly know something of Brahman.\nHe then points out that when come to truly know Brahman we will understand that we both know and\ndo not know Brahman, that it is foolish to say either, \u201cI know Brahman,\u201d or \u201cI do not know Brahman.\u201d\nIn wisdom, the two go together.\nIf you still do not get the idea, do not worry. The upanishadic author assumed we might not, so he gives\nus this verse to clear things up:\n\u201cHe truly knows Brahman who knows him as beyond knowledge; he who thinks that he knows, knows\nnot. The ignorant think that Brahman is known, but the wise know him to be beyond knowledge.\u201d\nPractical experience\nThe knowledge of Brahman is not an intellectual matter, and neither is it incapacitating, despite the\ncommon misconception that mystical vision renders us unfit for practical life. So the next verse tells us:\n\u201cHe who realizes the existence of Brahman behind every activity of his being whether sensing,\nperceiving, or thinking\u2013he alone gains immortality. Through knowledge of Brahman comes power.\nThrough knowledge of Brahman comes victory over death.\u201d\nTo live in unbroken consciousness of God is liberation. Liberation is possible even here in this world,\nwhile living in the body. For the upanishad continues:\n\u201cBlessed is the man who while he yet lives realizes Brahman. The man who realizes him not suffers his\ngreatest loss. When they depart this life, the wise, who have realized Brahman as the Self in all beings,\nbecome immortal.\u201d\n\nThe Blessed\n\u201cBlessed is the man who while he yet lives realizes Brahman. The man who realizes him not suffers his\ngreatest loss. When they depart this life, the wise, who have realized Brahman as the Self in all beings,\nbecome immortal.\u201d\nSwami Nikhilananda renders this verse: \u201cIf a man knows Atman here, he then attains the true goal of\nlife. If he does not know It here, a great destruction awaits him. Having realized the Self in every being,\nthe wise relinquish the world and become immortal.\u201d\nHere and now\nIt is affirmed over and over in the upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita that perfect realization and\nliberation is possible even here in the world. This is one of the glories of Sanatana Dharma. It does not\nhold out some vague \u201cbye and bye\u201d hope to be realized only after death\u2013a sure trait of fraudulent\nreligion. The truth of the Eternal Religion\u2013including Yoga\u2013can be proven at every moment of our life,\njust as advances in science, especially in physics and astronomy, reveal the truths intuited by the sages\nof India thousands of years ago.\nWe need to hold firmly to the fact that we can overcome ignorance and bondage in this very lifetime,\nthat we need not think it will take many incarnations to come to enlightenment. The Bhagavad Gita,\nparticularly, emphasizes the immediacy of our spiritual potential. \u201cFaith\u201d\u2013another trait of false\nreligion\u2013is not needed, either. Our practice of yoga and the resulting maturation of consciousness will\n\nenable us to see, experience, and demonstrate the great truths of the upanishads.\nWhat about doubts? They mean nothing, any more than blind beliefs. In some instances, a negative\nrejection of truth on the subconscious level masquerades as doubts and can hinder our progress. But\nhonest doubts cannot. I could cite for you many instances in which I not only doubted something, I\ndenied its possibility, but still I came to see for myself the truth of what I had not believed. My practice\nof yoga kept pushing the frontiers of my insight into areas that I had ignorantly thought were\nsuperstition or silly. And my doubt and denial did not delay even for a moment my coming to\nunderstand the truth I had disbelieved.\nThis is why no scripture of India is considered to be the \u201cword of God,\u201d the supreme and final\nauthority. Scriptures, like spiritual teachers, can only point the way, but they cannot definitively state\n\u201cthe truth.\u201d Yet through interior development there is nothing that can elude the yogi in his quest for\nreality. This is why Krishna speaks of Abhyasa Yoga\u2013the Yoga of Practice\u2013as the foundation for those\nwho wish to really know.\nThe great loss\nThose who do not realize God suffer the greatest loss, for they \u201close\u201d themselves and God. What, then,\nis left for them? Nothing. Desolate they wander in the desert of their own barren minds and hearts.\nShankara says that the mahati vinashtih, the great destruction, is interminable birth and death in the\nmaterial world with all is attendant pains, sorrows, and fears.\nThe great gain\nOn the other hand, the wise whose consciousness is steadfastly fixed in God, turn away from the\nworld\u2013or more exactly, from the bonds and blandishments of the world\u2013and become immortal\n(amritam bhavanti) by entering forever into Immortal Brahman.\nBlessed are those who live their lives in the perspective of this single verse. Realization and attainment\nshall be theirs. For them immortality shall be their assured and eternal future.\n\nApproaching Brahman\nThe Kena Upanishad is quite brief, and now concludes with a story and a short reflection on the story.\nHere is the story:\nThe victory of the gods\nOnce the gods won a victory over the demons, and though they had done so only through the power of\nBrahman, they were exceedingly vain.\nThey thought to themselves, \u201cIt was we who beat our enemies, and the glory is ours.\u201d Brahman saw\ntheir vanity and appeared before them. But they did not recognize him.\nThen the other gods said to the god of fire: \u201cFire, find out for us who this mysterious spirit is.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d\nsaid the god of fire, and approached the spirit.\nThe spirit said to him: \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cI am the god of fire. As a matter of fact, I am very widely\nknown.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what power do you wield?\u201d \u201cI can burn anything on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cBurn this,\u201d said the spirit, placing a straw before him. The god of fire fell upon it with all his might,\nbut could not consume it. So he ran back to the other gods, and said: \u201cI cannot discover who this\nmysterious spirit is.\u201d\nThen said the other gods to the god of wind: \u201cWind, do you find out for us who he is.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the\ngod of wind, and approached the spirit.\nThe spirit said to him: \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cI am the god of wind. As a matter of fact, I am very widely\nknown. I fly swiftly through the heavens.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what power do you wield?\u201d \u201cI can blow away anything on earth.\u201d\n\u201cBlow this away,\u201d said the spirit, placing a straw before him. The god of wind fell upon it with all his\nmight, but was unable to move it. So he ran back to the other gods, and said: \u201cI cannot discover who\nthis mysterious spirit is.\u201d\nThen said the other gods to Indra, greatest of them all: \u201cO respected one, find out for us, we pray you,\nwho he is.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Indra, and drew nigh to the spirit. But the spirit vanished,\nAnd in his place stood Uma, God the Mother, well adorned and of exceeding beauty. Beholding her,\nIndra asked: \u201cWho was the spirit that appeared to us?\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d answered Uma, \u201cwas Brahman. Through him it was, not of yourselves, that you attained your\nvictory and your glory.\u201d Thus did Indra, and the god of fire, and the god of wind, come to recognize\nBrahman.\nThe Divine Power\nThis is a very straightforward account. The \u201cgods\u201d are mostly the intelligent faculties of the individual\nhuman being. The \u201cdoctrinal\u201d element is very simple: the senses and mind cannot comprehend\nBrahman, but Its truth can be revealed by the Divine Feminine aspect of God, Mahashakti or Adishakti,\nthe Great, Primal Power that is the dynamic aspect of Brahman, the Prakriti\u2013Divine Creative Energy\u2013\nthat is inseparable from Purusha\u2013the Supreme Spirit. God the Father is Unmoving Consciousness,\nwhereas God the Mother is Moving Consciousness. The entire field of creation is Mother, the Father\nbeing the Transcendental Witness of Her manifestations. The Mother is the Divine Ladder which we\nascend to the Bosom of the Father.\nPrakriti proceeds from Purusha, the Holy Spirit \u201cproceeds from the Father.\u201d\nThe fundamental idea of the \u201cdance\u201d of the Creative Energy before the \u201cface\u201d of the Supreme Spirit is\nfound in the book of Proverbs where she speaks of herself, saying:\n\u201cThe Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made any thing from the beginning. I\nwas set up from eternity, and of old before the earth was made. The depths were not as yet, and I was\nalready conceived. neither had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out: The mountains with their huge\nbulk had not as yet been established: before the hills I was brought forth: He had not yet made the\nearth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of the world. When he prepared the heavens, I was present: when\nwith a certain law and compass he enclosed the depths: When he established the sky above, and poised\nthe fountains of waters: When he compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the waters that\nthey should not pass their limits: when be balanced the foundations of the earth; I was with him\nforming all things: and was delighted every day, playing before him at all times; playing in the world.\u201d\nThe Divine Mother dances the dance of creation before the witnessing Lord.\n\nAlthough Prabhavananda used the expression \u201cUma, God the Mother,\u201d the Sanskrit phrase is Uma\nHaimavatim. Uma in Indian history, was the daughter of King Himalaya, and so was called Himavati.\nShe was considered a manifestion (avatara) of the Divine Mother aspect of God. Uma is a name often\ngiven the Divine Power. But Shankara has a different, and interesting interpretation of Haimavatim. He\nsay it means \u201cone who was as though attired in dress of gold.\u201d\nThis is most intriguing, because in the Bible we have similar imagery of the Divine Mother, the Queen\u2013\nsometimes called \u201cthe King\u2019s Daughter\u201d because She emanates from the King\u2013being dressed in gold.\nDavid wrote: \u201cUpon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.\u201d And a few verses later: \u201cThe\nking\u2019s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.\u201d\nIn the book of Revelation we find: \u201cThere appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with\nthe sun.\u201d In this instance the \u201cgold\u201d is the light of the sun.\nThe elements\n\u201cThe god of fire, the god of wind, and Indra\u2014these excelled the other gods, for they approached\nnearest to Brahman and were the first to recognize him.\u201d\nAs said above, in this upanishadic story, the \u201cgods\u201d are mostly the intelligent faculties of the individual\nhuman being. However, Agni, Vayu, and Indra are representative of the primeval Elements fire, air, and\nether. These are \u201ccloser\u201d to the Self, to Brahman, than are the earth and water elements, whose faculties\nare smell and taste. The faculties of fire, air, and ether respectively are sight, touch, and sound. In\nmeditation we see light of various colors, experience sensations that are the inner modes of touch, and\nin our silent japa of Om hear the inner mental sound. These are three revealers of the presence of the\nSelf/Brahman. However:\n\u201cBut of all gods Indra is supreme, for he approached nearest of the three to Brahman and was the first\nof the three to recognize him.\u201d The etheric body is the nearest to the Self, and its faculty of sound is\nthat which unites our consciousness with Brahman. Thus etheric sound is the supreme \u201cgod\u201d by which\nwe \u201crecognize\u201d\u2013perceive\u2013Spirit.\nBrahman in all\nBrahman and Shakti (Power) are in reality one. Sri Ramakrishna often used the simile of fire and its\npower to burn. Fire is the Purusha and the burning power is the Prakriti. It is not amiss to say that\nPrakriti is the Effect of the presence of Brahman\u2013is Brahman Itself. The upanishad recapitulates this,\nsaying:\n\u201cThis is the truth of Brahman in relation to nature: whether in the flash of the lightning, or in the wink\nof the eyes, the power that is shown is the power of Brahman. This is the truth of Brahman in relation\nto man: in the motions of the mind, the power that is shown is the power of Brahman. For this reason\nshould a man meditate upon Brahman by day and by night.\u201d\nWherefore: \u201cBrahman is the adorable being in all beings. Meditate upon him as such. He who\nmeditates upon him as such is honored by all other beings.\u201d\nIt is the presence of Brahman which draws us to seek after or value an object. As the Brihadaranyaka\nUpanishad says:\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the husband, my beloved, that the husband is dear, but for the sake of\nthe Self.\n\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the wife, my beloved, that the wife is dear, but for the sake of the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the children, my beloved, that the children are dear, but for the sake of\nthe Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of wealth, my beloved, that wealth is dear, but for the sake of the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the Brahmins, my beloved, that the Brahmins are held in reverence, but\nfor the sake of the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the Kshatriyas, my beloved, that the Kshatriyas are held in honor, but\nfor the sake of the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the higher worlds, my beloved, that the higher worlds are desired, but\nfor the sake of the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the gods, my beloved, that the gods are worshiped, but for the sake of\nthe Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the creatures, my beloved, that the creatures are prized, but for the sake\nof the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of itself, my beloved, that anything whatever is esteemed, but for the sake\nof the Self.\u201d\nThe proof of this is the fact that when we successfully meditate on Brahman other sentient beings will\nsense the presence of Brahman in us and value us accordingly.\nIt is now up to us\nThe teaching is wonderful, but it is not enough. The student of the upanishadic sage intuits this, but\ncomes to a wrong conclusion, asking: \u201cSir, teach me more of the knowledge of Brahman.\u201d But the\nteacher responds: \u201cI have told you the secret knowledge.\u201d Naturally, the student will assume\u2013as would\nwe\u2013that the \u201csecret knowledge\u201d is the philosophy about Brahman, etc. Therefore the teacher continues:\n\u201cAusterity, self-control, performance of duty without attachment\u2013these are the body of that knowledge.\nThe Vedas are its limbs. Truth is its very soul.\u201d\nThe importance of this perspective simply cannot be exaggerated. The Secret Knowledge is not\nphilosophic formulations: It is practice\u2013what Krishna calls Abhyasa Yoga, the Yoga of Practice. The\nVedas are only its adjuncts. Truth is at its heart to be realized by the practitioners. Tapasya, selfmastery, and karma yoga form the body of the secret knowledge. There are no effects without a cause.\nThese three \u201ccause\u201d the knowing of Brahman. about which the sage concludes:\n\u201cHe who attains to knowledge of Brahman, being freed from all evil, finds the Eternal, the Supreme.\u201d\nEnd of Kena Commentary",
    "Katha": "\n\nKatha Upanishad\nTranslaetd by Vidyavachaspati V. Panoli\nOm ! May He protect us both together (by illumining the nature of knowledge).\n\nMay He sustain us both (by ensuring the fruits of knowledge).\nMay we attain the vigour (of knowledge) together.\nLet what we learn enlighten us.\nLet us not hate each other.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\n1-I-1. Out of desire, so goes the story, the son of Vajasrava gave away all his wealth. He had a son\nnamed Nachiketas.\n1-I-2. Though young, faith possessed him as presents were being brought; he thought:\n1-I-3. Water has been drunk (for the last time by these cows), grass has been eaten (for the last time);\nthey have yielded all their milk, and are devoid of (the power of) the organs. Those worlds are indeed\njoyless where he goes who offers these.\n1-I-4. He then said to his parent, \"father, to whom wilt thou give me?\" A second time and a third time\n(he said it). To him he (the father) said, \"To Death I give thee.\"\n1-I-5. Of many I go the first; of many I go the middle most. What purpose of Yama could there be\nwhich (my father) will get accomplished today through me?\n1-I-6. Think how your ancestors behaved; behold how others now behave. Like corn man decays, and\nlike corn he is born again.\n1-I-7. Like Vaisvanara (fire), a Brahmana guest enters the houses. Men offer this to propitiate him. O\nVaivasvata (Yama): fetch water (for him).\n1-I-8. Hope, expectation, association with the effects (of these two), pleasant discourse, sacrifice, acts\nof pious liberality, sons and cattle \u2013 all these are destroyed in the case of the man of little intellect in\nwhose house a Brahmana dwells without food.\n1-I-9. O Brahmana, since thou, a worshipful guest, hast dwelt in my house for three nights without\nfood, let me make salutation to thee. O Brahmana, may peace be with me. Therefore, ask for three\nboons in return.\n1-I-10. O Death, let Gautama (my father) be relieved of the anxiety, let him become calm in mind and\nfree from anger (towards me), and let him recognise me and talk to me when liberated by thee. Of the\nthree boons, this is the first I choose.\n1-I-11. Ouddalaki, the son of Aruna, will recognise thee as before and will, with my permission, sleep\npeacefully during nights and on seeing thee released from the jaws of Death, he will be free from anger.\n1-I-12. There is no fear in heaven; nor art thou there; nor is there any fear from old age. Transcending\nboth hunger and thirst and rising above grief, man rejoices in heaven.\n1-I-13. O Death, thou knowest the Fire that leads to heaven. Instruct me, who am endowed with faith,\nabout that (Fire) by which those who dwell in heaven attain immortality. This I choose for my second\nboon.\n1-I-14. I will teach thee well; listen to me and understand, O Nachiketas, I know the Fire that leads to\nheaven. Know that Fire which is the means for the attainment of heaven and which is the support (of\nthe universe) and located in the cavity.\n1-I-15. Death told him of the Fire, the source of the worlds, the sort of bricks (for raising the sacrificial\naltar), how many, and how (to kindle the fire) and he (Nachiketas) too repeated it as it was told. Then\nDeath, becoming delighted over it, said again:\n1-I-16. The exalted one, being pleased, said to him: \"I grant thee again another boon now. By thy name\nitself shall this fire be known; and accept thou this necklace of manifold forms\".\n1-I-17. Whoso kindles the Nachiketas fire thrice and becomes united with the three and does the threefold karma, transcends birth and death. Knowing the omniscient one, born of Brahma, bright and\nadorable, and realizing it, he attains to surpassing peace.\n1-I-18. He who, knowing the three (form of brick etc.,), piles up the Nachiketa Fire with this\nknowledge, throws off the chains of death even before (the body falls off), and rising over grief,\n\nrejoices in heaven.\n1-I-19. This is the Fire, O Nachiketas, which leads to heaven and which thou hast chosen for the second\nboon. Of this Fire, people will speak as thine indeed. O Nachiketas, choose the third boon.\n1-I-20. This doubt as to what happens to a man after death \u2013 some say he is, and some others say he is\nnot, \u2013 I shall know being taught by thee. Of the boons, this is the third boon.\n1-I-21. Even by the gods this doubt was entertained in days of yore. This topic, being subtle, is not easy\nto comprehend. Ask for some other boon, O Nachiketas. Don\u2019t press me; give up this (boon) for me.\n1-I-22. (Nachiketas said:) Since even by the gods was doubt entertained in this regard and (since) thou\nsayest, O Death, that this is not easily comprehended, no other preceptor like thee can be had to instruct\non this nor is there any other boon equal to this.\n1-I-23. Ask for sons and grandsons who will live a hundred years. Ask for herds of cattle, elephants\ngold and horses, as also for a vast extent of earth and thyself live for as many autumns as thou desirest.\n1-I-24. If thou thinkest any other boon to be equal to this, ask for wealth and longevity. Be thou the\nruler over a vast country, O Nachiketas; I shall make thee enjoy all thy longings.\n1-I-25. What all things there are in the human world which are desirable, but hard to win, pray for all\nthose desirable things according to thy pleasure. Here are these damsels with the chariots and lutes, the\nlike of whom can never be had by men. By them, given by me, get thy services rendered, O Nachiketas,\ndo not ask about death.\n1-I-26. These, O Death, are ephemeral and they tend to wear out the vigour of all the senses of man.\nEven the whole life is short indeed. Be thine alone the chariots; be thine the dance and music.\n1-I-27. Man cannot be satisfied with wealth. If we need wealth, we shall get it if we only see thee. We\nshall live until such time as thou wilt rule. But the boon to be asked for (by me) is that alone.\n1-I-28. Having gained contact with the undecaying and the immortal, what decaying mortal dwelling\non the earth below who knows the higher goal, will delight in long life, after becoming aware of the\n(transitoriness of) beauty (Varian) and sport (rati) and the joy (pramoda) thereof.\n1-I-29. O Death, tell us of that, of the great Beyond, about which man entertain doubt. Nachiketas does\nnot pray for any other boon than this which enters into the secret that is hidden.\n1-II-1. Different is (that which is) preferable; and different, indeed, is the pleasurable. These two,\nserving different purposes, blind man. Good accrues to him who, of these two, chooses the preferable.\nHe who chooses the pleasurable falls from the goal.\n1-II-2. The preferable and the pleasurable approach man. The intelligent one examines both and\nseparates them. Yea, the intelligent one prefers the preferable to the pleasurable, (whereas) the ignorant\none selects the pleasurable for the sake of yoga (attainment of that which is not already possessed) and\nkshema (the preservation of that which is already in possession).\n1-II-3. Thou hast relinquished, O Nachiketas, all objects of desire, dear and of covetable nature,\npondering over their worthlessness. Thou hast not accepted the path of wealth in which perish many a\nmortal.\n1-II-4. What is known as ignorance and what is known as knowledge are highly opposed (to each\nother), and lead to different ways. I consider Nachiketas to be aspiring after knowledge, for desires,\nnumerous though they be, did not tear thee away.\n1-II-5. Living in the midst of ignorance and deeming themselves intelligent and enlightened, the\nignorant go round and round staggering in crooked paths, like the blind led by the blind.\n1-II-6. The means of attaining the other world does not become revealed to the non-discriminating one\nwho, deluded by wealth, has become negligent. He who thinks, \u2018this world alone is and none else\u2019\ncomes to my thraldom again and again.\n1-II-7. Of the Self many are not even able to hear; Him many, though they hear, do not comprehend.\nWonderful is the expounder of the Self and attainer, proficient. The knower (of the Self) taught by an\nable preceptor is wonderful.\n\n1-II-8. This (Self), if taught by an inferior person, is not easily comprehended, for It is variously\nthought of. Unless taught by another (who is a perceiver of non-difference) there is no way (of\ncomprehending It), for It is not arguable and is subtler than subtlety.\n1-II-9. This (knowledge of the Self) attained by thee cannot be had through argumentation. O dearest,\nthis doctrine, only if taught by some teacher (other than a logician), leads to right knowledge. O, thou\nart rooted in truth. May a questioner be ever like thee, O Nachiketas.\n1-II-10. I know that the treasure is impermanent, for that which is constant cannot be reached by things\nwhich are not constant. Therefore, has the Nachiketa Fire been kindled by me with impermanent things,\nand I have attained the eternal.\n1-II-11. The fulfilment of all desires, the support of the universe, the endless fruits of sacrifice, the\nother shore of fearlessness, the extensive path which is praiseworthy and great, as also (thy own\nexalted) state \u2013 seeing all these thou hast, intelligent as thou art, boldly rejected (them).\n1-II-12. The intelligent one, knowing through concentration of mind the Self that is hard to perceive,\nlodged in the innermost recess, located in intelligence, seated amidst misery, and ancient, abandons joy\nand grief.\n1-II-13. Having heard this and grasped it well, the mortal, separating the virtuous being (from the body\netc.,) and attaining this subtle Self, rejoices having obtained that which causes joy. The abode (of\nBrahman), I think, is wide open unto Nachiketas.\n1-II-14. Tell me of that which thou seest as distinct from virtue, distinct from vice, distinct from effect\nand cause, distinct from the past and the future.\n1-II-15. The goal which all the Vedas expound, which all austerities declare, and desiring which\naspirants resort to Brahmacharya, that goal, I tell thee briefly: It is this \u2013 Om.\n1-II-16. This syllable (Om) indeed is the (lower) Brahman; this syllable indeed is the higher Brahman;\nwhosoever knows this syllable, indeed, attains whatsoever he desires.\n1-II-17. This support is the best; this support is the supreme. Knowing this support one is magnified in\nthe world of Brahman.\n1-II-18. The intelligent Self is not born, nor does It die. It did not come from anywhere, nor did\nanything come from It. It is unborn, eternal, everlasting and ancient, and is not slain even when the\nbody is slain.\n1-II-19. If the slayer thinks that he slays It and if the slain thinks of It as slain, both these do not know,\nfor It does not slay nor is It slain.\n1-II-20. The Self that is subtler than the subtle and greater than the great is seated in the heart of every\ncreature. One who is free from desire sees the glory of the Self through the tranquility of the mind and\nsenses and becomes absolved from grief.\n1-II-21. While sitting, It goes far, while lying It goes everywhere. Who other than me can know that\nDeity who is joyful and joyless.\n1-II-22. The intelligent one having known the Self to be bodiless in (all) bodies, to be firmly seated in\nthings that are perishable, and to be great and all-pervading, does not grieve.\n1-II-23. The Self cannot be attained by the study of the Vedas, not by intelligence nor by much hearing.\nOnly by him who seeks to know the Self can It be attained. To him the Self reveals Its own nature.\n1-II-24. None who has not refrained from bad conduct, whose senses are not under restraint, whose\nmind is not collected or who does not preserve a tranquil mind, can attain this Self through knowledge.\n1-II-25. The Self to which both the Brahmana and the Kshatriya are food, (as it were), and Death a\nsoup, how can one know thus where It is.\n1-III-1. The knowers of Brahman and those who kindle the five fires and propitiate the Nachiketa Fire\nthrice, speak of as light and shade, the two that enjoy the results of righteous deeds, entering within the\nbody, into the innermost cavity (of the heart), the supreme abode (of Brahman).\n1-III-2. May we be able to know the Nachiketa Fire which is the bridge for the sacrificers, as also the\n\nimperishable Brahman, fearless, as well as the other shore for those who are desirous of crossing (the\nocean of samsara).\n1-III-3. Know the Self to be the master of the chariot, and the body to be the chariot. Know the intellect\nto be the charioteer, and the mind to be the reins.\n1-III-4. The senses they speak of as the horses; the objects within their view, the way. When the Self is\nyoked with the mind and the senses, the wise call It the enjoyer.\n1-III-5. But whoso is devoid of discrimination and is possessed of a mind ever uncollected \u2013 his senses\nare uncontrollable like the vicious horses of a driver.\n1-III-6. But whoso is discriminative and possessed of a mind ever collected \u2013 his senses are\ncontrollable like the good horses of a driver.\n1-III-7. But whoso is devoid of a discriminating intellect, possessed of an unrestrained mind and is ever\nimpure, does not attain that goal, but goes to samsara.\n1-III-8. But whoso is possessed of a discriminating intellect and a restrained mind, and is ever pure,\nattains that goal from which he is not born again.\n1-III-9. But the man who has a discriminating intellect as his driver, and a controlled-mind as the reins,\nreaches the end of the path \u2013 that supreme state of Vishnu.\n1-III-10. The sensory objects are subtler than the senses, and subtler than the sensory objects is mind.\nBut intellect is subtler than mind and subtler than intellect is Mahat (the Hiranyagarbha).\n1-III-11. The unmanifested (avyakta) is subtler than Mahat (Hiranyagarbha) and subtler than the\nunmanifested is Purusha. There is nothing subtler than Purusha. That is the end, that is the supreme\ngoal.\n1-III-12. This Self hidden in all beings does not shine. But by seers of subtle and pointed intellect\ncapable of perceiving subtle objects, It is seen.\n1-III-13. Let the wise man merge speech in his mind, merge that (mind) into the intelligent self and the\nintelligent self into the Mahat. (Let him then) merge the Mahat into the peaceful Self.\n1-III-14. Arise, awake, and learn by approaching the exalted ones, for that path is sharp as a razor\u2019s\nedge, impassable, and hard to go by, say the wise.\n1-III-15. By knowing that which is soundless, touchless, formless, undecaying, so also tasteless,\neternal, odorless, beginningless, endless, subtler than Mahat and constant, man is liberated from the\njaws of death.\n1-III-16. Narrating and hearing this eternal story of Nachiketas told by Death, the intelligent man\nattains glory in the world of Brahman.\n1-III-17. Whoso, becoming pure, causes this supreme secret to be recited before am assembly of the\nBrahmanas, or at the time of Sraddha, that (ceremony) secures for him infinite results, secures infinite\nresults.\n2-I-1. The self-existent damned the out-going senses. Therefore one sees externally and not the internal\nSelf. Someone (who is) intelligent, with his eyes turned away, desirous of immortality, sees the inner\nSelf.\n2-I-2. The unintelligent go after outward pleasures; they fall into the meshes of wide-spread death. But\nthe intelligent, having known immortality to be constant, never covet here objects that are inconstant.\n2-I-3. By the self (a man knows) form, taste, odor, sound, touch, and the sexual joy. What remains here\n(unknowable to the Self)? This verily is that (thou seekest).\n2-I-4. Knowing that great and all-pervading Self by which one sees (the objects) both in the sleep and\nthe waking states, the intelligent man grieves no more.\n2-I-5. Whoso knows the self closely, the honey-eater, the supporter of the vital airs and the lord of the\npast and the future, will not henceforward protect himself. This verily is that (thou seekest).\n2-I-6. He who perceives the First-born that came into being from Tapas (Brahman) before the waters,\nand that, entering into the cavity of the heart, is seated there, he perceives that very Brahman. This\n\nverily is that (thou seekest).\n2-I-7. (He who perceives) this Aditi that comes into being as the Prana, comprising all the gods, that is\nmanifested along with the elements, and that, entering into the cavity of the heart, is seated there, he\nperceives that very Brahman. This verily is that (thou seekest).\n2-I-8. The (sacrificial) fire lodged in the two aranis, even as the foetus is carefully borne by the\npregnant woman, is fit to be worshipped every day by men who are wakeful and possessed of oblation.\nThis verily is that (thou seekest).\n2-I-9. On that from which the sun rises and in which it sets, are fixed all the gods. None ever goes\nbeyond that. This verily is that (thou seekest).\n2-I-10. What indeed is here is there; what is there is here again. Whoso here sees as though different,\npasses from death to death.\n2-I-11. By mind alone is this attainable; there is no difference here whatsoever. Whoso here sees as\nthough different, passes from death to death.\n2-I-12. The Purusha, of the size of a thumb, dwells in the body. (Realizing Him as) the Lord of the past\nand the future, one does not (henceforward) want to protect oneself. This verily is that (thou seekest).\n2-I-13. The Purusha of the size of a thumb is like a smokeless flame and is the Lord of the past and the\nfuture. He certainly exists now and shall certainly exist tomorrow. This verily is that (thou seekest).\n2-I-14. As rain-water fallen on a mountain ridge runs down the rocks, so does one seeing the selves\ndifferently run after them alone.\n2-I-15. As pure water poured into pure water remains the same only, so does the Self of the thinker who\nknows thus become, O Gautama.\n2-II-1. The city of the unborn whose knowledge is like the light of the sun, consists of eleven gates.\nMeditating on Him, one does not grieve and, becoming free (from bondage), one becomes liberated.\nThis verily is that (thou seekest).\n2-II-2. As mover (sun), He dwells in heaven; (as air), He pervades everything and dwells in inter-space;\nas fire, on the earth; as guest, in the houses; He dwells in men; dwells in the gods; dwells in truth and\ndwells in space. He is all that is born in water, all that is born on earth, all that is born in sacrifices and\nall that is born on the mountains; He is unchanging and great.\n2-II-3. (He) raises the prana upward and casts the apana downward. All the gods worship Him who is\nadorable and seated in the middle.\n2-II-4. When this Self seated in the body is torn away and freed from the body, what remains here? This\nverily is that (thou seekest).\n2-II-5. Not by prana, not by apana does a mortal live; but all live by something else on which these two\ndepend.\n2-II-6. I will describe to thee, O Gautama, this secret ancient Brahman and also what becomes of the\nSelf after death.\n2-II-7. Some jivas enter the womb for assuming bodies; others go into the unmoving, in accordance\nwith their karma and with their knowledge.\n2-II-8. This Purusha who is awake when all are asleep, creating all things cherished, is certainly pure;\nthat is Brahman; that is called the Immortal. All worlds are strung on that; none passes beyond that.\nThis verily is that (thou seekest).\n2-II-9. Just as fire, though one, having entered the world, assumes a separate form in respect of every\nform, so does the in-dwelling Self of all beings, though one, assume a form in respect of every form,\nand is outside it.\n2-II-10. Just as wind, though one, having entered the world, assumes a separate form in respect of each\nform, so does the in-dwelling Self of all beings, though one, assumes a form in respect of every form\nand is outside it.\n2-II-11. Just as the sun, which is the eye of the entire world, is not tainted by the external impurities\n\nseen by the eyes, so also, the in-dwelling Self of all beings, though one, is not tainted by the sorrows of\nthe world, It being external.\n2-II-12. Eternal happiness belongs to the intelligent \u2013 not to others \u2013 who realize in their hearts Him\nwho is one, the controller and the in-dwelling Self of all beings, and who makes the one form manifold.\n2-II-13. Whoso among the intelligent realize the Self in the (inner space of the) heart as the eternal\namong the ephemeral, the consciousness among the conscious, who, though one, dispenses the desired\nobjects to many, to them belongs eternal peace, not to others.\n2-II-14. How shall I know that indescribable and supreme Bliss which they think of as \u2018This\u2019? Is It selfluminous or does It shine distinctly, (making Itself perceptible to the intellect), or does It not?\n2-II-15. There the sun shines not, nor do the moon and the stars, nor do these lightnings. How (then)\ncan this fire (shine)? Everything shines after Him that shines. By His light shines all this.\n2-III-1. This peepul tree with root above and branches down is eternal. That (which is its source) is\ncertainly pure; that is Brahman and that is called immortal. On that are strung all the worlds; none\npasses beyond that. This verily is that (thou seekest).\n2-III-2. All this universe, evolved (from Brahman), moves in prana (in Brahman); the most frightful\nlike an uplifted thunderbolt. Those who know this become immortal.\n2-III-3. For fear of Him, fire burns;\nFor fear of Him, shines the sun;\nFor fear of Him, Indra and Vayu function;\nFor fear of Him, death, the fifth, stalks on the earth.\n2-III-4. If one could know here prior to the falling of the body, (one becomes liberated); (if not), one\nbecomes fit to be embodied in the worlds of creatures.\n2-III-5. As in a mirror, so in one\u2019s intellect; as in a dream, so in the world of manes; as seen in water, so\nin the world of the Gandharvas; as in the case of shade and light, so in the world of Brahma.\n2-III-6. The intelligent man, having known the different nature of the senses originating separately\n(from their causes), as also their rising and setting, does not grieve.\n2-III-7. The mind is subtler than the senses; subtler than the mind is the intellect; Mahat\n(Hiranyagarbha) is subtler than the intellect; subtler than Mahat is Avyakta (Unmanifested).\n2-III-8. But subtler than Avyakta is Purusha, all-pervading and without a linga (distinguishing mark)\nindeed, knowing whom a mortal becomes freed and attains immortality.\n2-III-9. His form does not stand within the scope of vision; none beholds Him with the eye. By the\nintellect restraining the mind, and through meditation is He revealed. Those who know this become\nimmortal.\n2-III-10. When the five senses of knowledge are at rest together with the mind, and the intellect is not\nactive, that state they call the highest.\n2-III-11. That steady restraint over the senses they regard as yoga. Then one becomes vigilant, for yoga\ncan indeed originate (in one) and can be lost (as well).\n2-III-12. Not by speech, not by mind, not by the eye can It be attained. Except in the case of one who\nsays, \u2018It exists\u2019, how can It be known to anyone else?\n2-III-13. The Self should be apprehended as existing and also as It really is. Of these two (aspects), to\nhim who knows It to exist, Its true nature is revealed.\n2-III-14. When all longings that are in the heart vanish, then a mortal becomes immortal and attains\nBrahman here.\n2-III-15. When all the knots of the heart are cut asunder here, then a mortal becomes immortal. Only\nthis much is the instruction.\n2-III-16. There are a hundred and one nerves of the heart. Of then, one goes out piercing the head.\nGoing up through that, one attains immortality; the others serve for departing in different ways.\n2-III-17. Purusha of the size of a thumb, the inner Self, is ever seated in the heart of all living beings.\n\nOne should, with steadiness, separate Him from one\u2019s own body as stalk from the Munja grass. One\nshould know Him as pure and immortal; one should know Him as pure and immortal.\n2-III-18. Nachiketas then, having acquired this knowledge imparted by Death, as also the instructions\non Yoga in entirety, attained Brahman having become dispassionate and deathless. So does become any\none else also who knows the inner Self thus.\nOm ! May He protect us both together (by illumining the nature of knowledge).\nMay He sustain us both (by ensuring the fruits of knowledge).\nMay we attain the vigour (of knowledge) together.\nLet what we learn enlighten us.\nLet us not hate each other.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Kathopanishad, as contained in the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.\n\nKatha Upanishad Commentary\nCommentary on the Katha Upanishad\u2013by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\nThe Past is the Future\nIn very ancient times a man named Vajrabasa decided to perform a rite intended to give the performer\ngreat merit. The rite entailed the giving away of all the performer\u2019s possessions. However he had no\nsuch intention, and instead was going to give away only his cattle\u2013and of them only the useless ones:\nthe old, the barren, the blind, and the lame. His son, Nachiketa, observing this, came to his father and\nsaid: \u201cFather, do not repent thy vow! Consider how it has been with those that have gone before, and\nhow it will be with those that now live. Like corn, a man ripens and falls to the ground; like corn, he\nsprings up again in his season.\u201d\nThere is no use denying it: we all follow in the path of Vajrabasa on occasion, though some do it more\nexuberantly. This is especially deadly in the realm of spiritual life.\nI well remember when two newly-made Indian friends from South India asked me wonderingly: \u201cWhat\nis an \u2018Indian giver\u2019?\u201d When I said it meant someone who promised but did not deliver, or who gave\nand then took back, they were really bewildered. But when I explained that it was not the Indians who\nwere the \u201cgivers\u201d but the deceitful white men, they understood\u2013and to my confusion thought it was\nvery funny. (When I told them about \u201cHonest Injun?\u201d and \u201cThe only good Indian is a dead Indian\u201d they\nlaughed till they cried, and thereafter frequently asked: \u201cHonest Injun?\u201d when I told them something.)\nIt is not funny when we are \u201cIndian givers\u201d in spiritual life, just as double-tongued and devious with\n\nGod and our own spirit as the politicians were with the Native Americans.\nOne of the funniest and most typical examples is found in the comic motion picture, The End. In one\nscene Burt Reynolds is swimming in the ocean about to drown. He starts shouting out to God how\nmuch of his income he vows to give if he survives. The percentage goes up and up to the total amount.\nBut then he sees that there is a chance he may make it back to shore. So the percentage starts dropping\nin proportion to how near he gets to the land! Finally he is telling God that he will be giving nothing,\nand if God does not like it, that is just too bad. We are very much (often exactly) like that ourselves.\nWhen we think we are not going to have something, or will have no use for it, we generously offer it to\nGod or renounce it. But the moment we see a need or a use for it, then we announce to ourselves that\nGod would not expect us to hand it over or renounce it.\nMany people start out spiritual life with great enthusiasm, ready to dedicate and sacrifice in order to\nattain liberation. But as time goes by, the sands in the hourglass of will and interest grow less and less,\nshifting back to the bottom level of ego and the material life until what remains is so feeble and\nnegligible it would be better if it, too, were eliminated in honesty.\nThe principle that we reap only and exactly what we sow is an absolute in spiritual life. Here are Saint\nPaul\u2019s words on the subject: \u201cBe not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that\nshall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth\nto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due\nseason we shall reap, if we faint not.\u201d Fainting is a very real possibility for all of us, and that is why\nthese warning words of Nachiketa were written in the upanishad: \u201cFather, do not repent thy vow!\nConsider how it has been with those that have gone before, and how it will be with those that now live.\nLike corn, a man ripens and falls to the ground; like corn, he springs up again in his season.\u201d\nThe law of reaping what has been sown\u2013and conversely not reaping what has not been sown\u2013is to be\ntaken most seriously in all aspects of life, but especially in spiritual matters. Solomon cautions us:\n\u201cWhen thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for\u2026better is it that thou shouldest not vow,\nthan that thou shouldest vow and not pay.\u201d The question here is not that of God being angry or sad at\nour non-payment, but the negative effect our own perfidy will have on us directly. It is not God that\nrewards and punishes, but our own self, and its justice is inexorable. So asking God to release us or\nforgive us means positively nothing\u2013it is our own self we are dealing with and it cannot be gotten\naround in any degree whatsoever.\nSad to say, there are many examples of \u201cthose that have gone before\u201d who foolishly reneged on their\nown selves and suffered the consequences, from simple unhappiness to abject and long-lasting misery,\nand even death. This latter is no exaggeration, I know of examples myself. If you will excuse me, I will\nnot cite any examples at all, for it is simply too bleak. Just do not be one yourself! But I will tell you\nthe principle I have seen demonstrated over and over again: Whatever a person abandons his spiritual\nlife to keep or to gain will be (usually abruptly or even violently) taken away from him and he will\nnever regain or restart his spiritual life in this incarnation. I have never seen an exception. Never. (I\nam, however, not speaking of merely risking or retarding the personal spiritual life\u2013we all do that just\nfrom making mistakes or from silly foibles\u2013but of the actual giving up and turning from, even rejecting\nof, one\u2019s spiritual life and obligations. This is fatal.)\nAt every step of our spiritual life we must keep in mind the law of cause and effect and \u201cconsider how\nit has been with those that have gone before, and how it will be with those that now live.\u201d And lest we\nthink that if we escape the karmic reaction in this life we are \u201chome free,\u201d Nachiketa added: \u201cLike\ncorn, a man ripens and falls to the ground; like corn, he springs up again in his season.\u201d So there are\n\nfuture lives in which our neglect can come to fruition in many forms\u2013all inimical to our further\nprogress.\nOf course, the words of Nachiketa only have meaning to the wise. As Krishna told Arjuna: \u201cEven a\nwise man acts according to the tendencies of his own nature. All living creatures follow their\ntendencies. What use is any external restraint? If a man keeps following my teaching with faith in his\nheart, and does not make mental reservations, he will be released from the bondage of his karma. But\nthose who scorn my teaching, and do not follow it, are lost. They are without spiritual discrimination.\nAll their knowledge is a delusion.\u201d\n\nSeeing Death, Seeing Life\nVisiting Death\nLong ago a man named Vajrabasa undertook a ritual to gain divine favor, but deliberately performed it\nin such a way that only misfortune could accrue to him rather than good. His virtuous son, Nachiketa,\ntried to reason with him, but in response he uttered the curse: \u201cThee I give to Death!\u201d\nNachiketa was no ordinary son. He was an accomplished yogi, one who could penetrate into the unseen\nworlds, and in keeping with his unjust father\u2019s unjust words he went to the realm presided over by\nYamaraja, the King of Death. Yama welcomed him with great respect and told Nachiketa to ask three\nfavors from him. Being a worthy son of an unworthy father, his first request was that his father should\nsuffer no anxiety about his fate, but that his anger should be appeased so that when Nachiketa returned\nhome his father would acknowledge and welcome him. Yama agreed.\nNext Nachiketa asked to learn the sacrificial rite that leads to heaven. Yama agreed to that also and\ntaught him. Then Yama asked him to make his third request. The upanishadic text continues:\n\u201cAnd then Nachiketa considered within himself, and said:\n\u201c\u2018When a man dies, there is this doubt: Some say, he is; others say, he is not. Taught by thee, I would\nknow the truth. This is my third wish.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Nay,\u2019 replied Death, \u2018even the gods were once puzzled by this mystery. Subtle indeed is the truth\nregarding it, not easy to understand. Choose thou some other boon, O Nachiketa.\u2019\n\u201cBut Nachiketa would not be denied.\n\u201c\u2018Thou sayest, O Death, that even the gods were once puzzled by this mystery, and that it is not easy to\nunderstand. Surely there is no teacher better able to explain it than thou\u2013and there is no other boon\nequal to this.\u2019\n\u201cTo which, trying Nachiketa again, the god replied:\n\u201c\u2018Ask for sons and grandsons who shall live a hundred years. Ask for cattle, elephants, horses, gold.\nChoose for thyself a mighty kingdom. Or if thou canst imagine aught better, ask for that\u2013not for sweet\npleasures only but for the power, beyond all thought, to taste their sweetness. Yea, verily, the supreme\nenjoyer will I make thee of every good thing. Celestial maidens, beautiful to behold, such indeed as\nwere not meant for mortals\u2014even these, together with their bright chariots and their musical\ninstruments, will I give unto thee, to serve thee. But for the secret of death, O Nachiketa, do not ask!\u2019\n\u201cBut Nachiketa stood fast, and said: \u2018These things endure only till the morrow, O Destroyer of Life,\n\nand the pleasures they give wear out the senses. Keep thou therefore horses and chariots, keep dance\nand song, for thyself. How shall he desire wealth, O Death, who once has seen thy face? Nay, only the\nboon that I have chosen\u2013that only do I ask. Having found out the society of the imperishable and the\nimmortal, as in knowing thee I have done, how shall I, subject to decay and death, and knowing well\nthe vanity of the flesh\u2013how shall I wish for long life?\n\u201c\u2018Tell me, O King, the supreme secret regarding which men doubt. No other boon will I ask.\u2019\n\u201cWhereupon the King of Death, well pleased at heart, began to teach Nachiketa the secret of\nimmortality.\u201d\nThe mystery\nAs Yama told Nachiketa, even those powerful beings that control the forces of the cosmos have been\npuzzled by the mystery of whether those who have gone beyond death can be said to exist or not to\nexist. Reflective human beings have agonized over the same problem. When they came to Buddha with\nthe question he refused to give any answer, saying that whichever he told them they would\nmisunderstand and distort his words. So he said nothing. Consequently, to say that Buddha taught the\nnon-existence of an immortal self and individual immortality is perhaps an even worse distortion than\nthat which he sought to avoid through silence.\nYama, however, was not talking to word-juggling ignoramuses, but to an eminently qualified inquirer.\nYet, testing the strength of Nachiketa\u2019s interest in such a profound matter, he attempted to dissuade him\nfrom pressing the question. When that failed, he resorted to that which has effectively deflected\n\u201cseekers\u201d through the history of humanity. He offered him long-lived and prosperous progeny, vast\nmaterial wealth and possessions, unlimited pleasure and unlimited power, and finally, dominion over\neven the subtle worlds and all that is therein. Throughout countless ages the mere promise or prospect\nof such acquisitions have turned awakening consciousnesses from the path of immortality and led them\nfurther into the morass of mortal life. But Nachiketa could not be moved from his original resolve to\nlearn the truth regarding immortality.\nThe Katha Upanishad cannot have been unknown to Jesus when he lived and studied in India, and it\ncan be speculated that it was in the context of the teachings of this upanishad that he asked his\ndisciples: \u201cWhat is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what\nshall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d I have to admit that when as a primary grade-schooler I first\nheard this verse read out in church, I immediately thought: \u201cNo. The real question is: \u2018What will a man\ntake in exchange for his soul?\u2019\u201d Through the years I kept questioning as to whether things were a\nblessing for life or a bribe to embrace inner death. This, too, we see so often. From those early years\nand even till now I have seen so many bribes offered and taken, all of them cheap and paltry compared\nto what the seekers would have gained if they had turned away from the offers. And as I have pointed\nout, in every instance the promise was withdrawn unfulfilled or the \u201cgain\u201d was ruthlessly wrested from\ntheir grasp and they were left broken and empty. People do not need to die to become \u201clost souls.\u201d The\nsuffering may not be eternal, but it is no less terrible for that. I can truthfully say that throughout my\nlife the most desolate souls I have met were those that said to me with sad nostalgia: \u201cI used to be\u2026,\u201d\nand then mentioned some abandoned spiritual calling or involvement. The wheels of life were grinding\nthem down and tormenting them with the bitter memory of their loss along with the impossibility of\ntheir regaining that which they had so carelessly and foolishly tossed aside for \u201clife\u201d long ago.\nLet us attend!\nIn Eastern Christian worship the exclamation \u201cLet us attend!\u201d is usually uttered before some special\n\nreading or prayer is about to be intoned. We should indeed attend to the words of Nachiketa when he\nreplied to Yama\u2019s offer:\n\u201cThese things endure only till the morrow, O Destroyer of Life, and the pleasures they give wear out\nthe senses. Keep thou therefore horses and chariots, keep dance and song, for thyself. How shall he\ndesire wealth, O Death, who once has seen thy face? Nay, only the boon that I have chosen\u2013that only\ndo I ask. Having found out the society of the imperishable and the immortal, as in knowing thee I have\ndone, how shall I, subject to decay and death, and knowing well the vanity of the flesh\u2013how shall I\nwish for long life? Tell me, O King, the supreme secret regarding which men doubt. No other boon will\nI ask.\u201d\nIn Christianity and Buddhism a great deal of emphasis is placed on the memory of death as a universal\nprinciple and the particular mortality of each one of us. In the West this is superficially shrugged off as\nmorbidity and \u201cunhealthy,\u201d but it can be salutary indeed. It was only sensible that Nachiketa, having\ncome face-to-face with Death, should disregard all that which the human race has been madly seeking\nthroughout its existence. For in the East (including Christianity) only that which lasts forever without\nany change is considered Real. Everything else is unreal, illusory. Therefore that which can change and\npass away is even now essentially nothing. Who, then, would value any such? There is no need for a\nlengthy philosophical analysis of psychic niceties or suchlike. The fact of their evanescent nature turns\nall desired objects to mere fantasies in the consciousness of the wise.\n\u201cWhereupon the King of Death, well pleased at heart, began to teach Nachiketa the secret of\nimmortality.\u201d\n\nThe Good and the Pleasant\n\u201cThe good is one thing; the pleasant is another. These two, differing in their ends, both prompt to\naction. Blessed are they that choose the good; they that choose the pleasant miss the goal.\u201d\nHow simple and direct these words are! When, after years of being soaked (sometimes drowned) in\nmere religion, when I found dharma one of the most beautiful and wonderful things about it was its\nincredible simplicity. The religion I had had before was simplistic\u2013childishly so\u2013but at the same time it\nwas complex, convoluted and tangled, because that was state of mind that had produced it and which it\nproduced in those unfortunate enough to accept and follow it. (Many avoided the problem by\nprofessing the religion but not really following it.) In contrast, the profound dharma was also as simple\nas the great ocean, gathering all into unity. I had tried reading Western philosophers and theologians,\nand found them impossible to understand\u2013mostly because they were not really saying anything. The\nfirst time I opened a book by Shankara, the greatest philosopher India has ever produced, it was with\nreal anxiety. Would I break apart on the rock of his verbiage? Not at all. Every sentence was so\nexquisitely clear, every concept so unbelievably simple\u2013and equally vast and deep. I understood why:\nShankara knew by his acquisition of Divine Consciousness. When Shankara talked to me God was\nspeaking. And God knows how to communicate.\nNeither Shankara nor the Upanishads or the Gita really require a commentary. All a \u201ccommentator\u201d can\nreally do is expand what is already there so we do not rush from point to point in the original text and\nmiss so much of it. Actually, all my commentaries are really Pauses and Reflections. There is no need\nto explain to you what those sacred texts mean. You can easily understand them for yourself. So all I\nam really doing is ruminating over them with you. We are digesting them together. It is very satisfying.\nAt least to me\u2013I hope it is to you, also.\n\nThe good and the pleasant\n\u201cThe good is one thing; the pleasant is another.\u201d This does not have to be the situation\u2013the problem is\nin us. Since the good dissolves the ego and frees us from its seemingly eternal domination and\nbondage, it is only natural that those who are inured, even addicted, to its rule will find the good bitter\nin the extreme. In the closing chapter of the Bhagavad Gita Krishna speaks of the one who chooses the\ngood: \u201cDeep his delight after strict self-schooling: sour toil at first but at last what sweetness, the end of\nsorrow.\u201d Who would not choose this? Just about everybody. Why? Because it requires \u201cstrict selfschooling.\u201d We have to educate and deliver ourselves. Neither God nor any holy being can do it for us.\nTherefore those who cling to their ego-addiction avidly \u201ctake refuge\u201d in and \u201csurrender\u201d to and \u201cplace\nall my trust\u201d in God, gods, gurus, saints, teachers, a religion, and whatever, knowing at least\nsubconsciously that it will not work, for they alone can do the needful. The Holy Ones have already\ndone all they could do for them. They have given the message and pointed out the way. Now it is their\nturn to get to work. Otherwise nothing will happen. And in their perversity this satisfies them\ncompletely, though they cover it up with religiosity and \u201cdevotion.\u201d Those who do wish to achieve the\ngood must shake off their self-hypnosis and begin the labor. They will be surprised at how pleasant it\nreally is, and in time will come to realize that they were enjoying pain and avoiding the real pleasure\nthat is found only in spiritual life.\nKrishna describes the pleasant as essentially \u201csweet at first but at last how bitter: that pleasure is\npoison.\u201d It is not just harmful\u2013it is deadly. Saint Ignatius of Antioch, a disciple of Saint John the\nEvangelist, wrote of those who, drinking a sweet drink that contains poison, \u201csweetly drink in their\ndeath.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t we having fun?\u201d \u201cCome on\u2013live!\u201d \u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find out\nwhat it is all about?\u201d \u201cWhat do you know about life?\u201d These are the desperate appeals of those whose\nconsciousness is awakened enough for them to be tormented by the example of those who have more\nfully awakened and who \u201ctouch not the cup\u2013it is death to the soul.\u201d\nThe wise know that the good and the pleasant utterly differ in their ends. The pleasant leads to ever\nmore addiction, a craving for ever-increasing intoxication, and finally complete collapse and\ndestruction.\n\"When senses touch objects, the pleasures therefrom are like wombs that bear sorrow.They begin, they\nare ended. They bring no delight to the wise.\"\nOn the other hand:\n\"Self-controlled, cut free from desire, curbing the heart, and knowing the Atman, man finds Nirvana\nthat is in Brahman, here and hereafter.\"\n\u201cFor when a man\u2019s heart has reached fulfillment through knowledge and personal experience of the\ntruth of Brahman, he is never again moved by the things of the senses. Earth, stone and gold seem all\nalike to one who has mastered his senses. Such a yogi is said to have achieved union with Brahman.\nThen he knows that infinite happiness which can be realized by the purified heart but is beyond the\ngrasp of the senses. He stands firm in this realization. Because of it, he can never again wander from\nthe inmost truth of his being.\u201d\nThe good also leads to complete collapse and destruction\u2013the collapse and disintegration of the ego and\nits attendants, ignorance and desire. Then:\nHe knows bliss in the Atman, and wants nothing else. Cravings torment the heart: he renounces\ncravings. I call him illumined.\n\nThe man of faith, whose heart is devoted, whose senses are mastered: he finds Brahman. Enlightened,\nhe passes at once to the highest, the peace beyond passion.\nHis mind is dead to the touch of the external: it is alive to the bliss of the Atman. Because his heart\nknows Brahman his happiness is for ever.\nAlready, here on earth, before his departure, let man be the master of every impulse\nLust-begotten or fathered by anger: thus he finds Brahman, thus he is happy.\nMotivating forces\n\u201cThese two, differing in their ends, both prompt to action.\u201d Both the good and the pleasant impel us to\nactions, but they do so in completely different ways.\nThe good points us to the way of benefit in a completely intelligent and non-emotional way. For\nexample, the good never motivates us by selfish means such as promising reward or threatening\npunishment\u2013this is the way of evil, including much of religion. The good motivates us toward itself\nsimply by revealing its inherent value.\nThe pleasant is altogether different. It only shows us its external appearance. It does not reason with us,\nbut entices or even compels us to seize it. The pleasant only shows us its immediate or short-term\neffect, but completely hides from us its long-term effects and blinds us to its inherent defects. The\narchetypal example of this is found in the Bible. There we are told that \u201cwhen the woman saw that the\ntree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise,\nshe took of the fruit thereof, and did eat.\u201d Here we see all the problems with the pleasant: only the\nexternal is considered, emotion and instinct come to dominate and eclipse reason, and the ultimate\neffect is completely unapparent.\nIn sum, the good reveals but the pleasant conceals. It is necessary that we see the good as truly good\nand the pleasant as harmful and even evil. This is not easy.\nThe bigger picture\nOne of the problems with prevailing religion of all kinds is its incredible small-sightedness. Like the\npleasant-oriented and pleasant-obsessed ego which it supports and feeds, it is concerned with only the\nmoment at hand or with goals that are utterly irrelevant to the real nature of the human being. When we\nunderstand who/what we really are, then alone can we comprehend what is the sole purpose of our\nexistence: conscious union with the Absolute. In light of this the upanishad concludes: \u201cBlessed are\nthey that choose the good; they that choose the pleasant miss the goal.\u201d So the discrimination between\nthe good and the pleasant is no light matter.\nA genuine test of character\nIn the twenty-fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew we find a parable about foolish and wise souls.\nMost of us do not really care if we are foolish, just as long as no one labels us so. But we should care,\nand so the upanishad continues its teaching, saying:\n\u201cBoth the good and the pleasant present themselves to men. The wise, having examined both,\ndistinguish the one from the other. The wise prefer the good to the pleasant; the foolish, driven by\nfleshly desires, prefer the pleasant to the good.\u201d There is a lot of truth in these few lines, some of it\nembarrassing, but nevertheless beneficial for us. (The good is not the pleasant, even in philosophy.)\n\n\u201cBoth the good and the pleasant present themselves to men.\u201d Whatever may be the excuses we may\nmake for ourselves, even portraying ourselves as weak or victims, no one, NO ONE, forces anything\nupon us in life, however much it may seem otherwise. Rather, the good and the pleasant simply\n\u201cpresent themselves\u201d to us. We are totally responsible for our response to them, although, like Adam\nand Eve back in Genesis, we try to put the blame on someone else, on some external factor.\nIt is really essential to us as we move through life (hopefully forward) that although our deluded\nexperience seems just the opposite, in reality all \u201cthings\u201d are completely neutral\u2013it is our response to\nthem that really gives them any character such as good, bad, destructive, positive, etc. A little thought\nwill show this. The deadliest poison is harmless if we do not make contact with it. Conversely, the best\nmedicine is worthless if we do not consume it. Or think of this: garbage seems heavenly food to a\nstarving person, but not to someone who is well fed; a child\u2019s toy means nothing to a mature adult.\nNothing has an innate ability to draw or force us\u2013all the drawing and forcing is in our own mind as it\nresponds to the object. We can blame no one at any time. It is all in us. If there are no grass seeds in the\nsoil no grass will grow. The seeds have to be in us to sprout and grow and bear fruit as thinking,\nwilling, and acting.\n\u201cThe wise, having examined both, distinguish the one from the other.\u201d Viveka, the ability to distinguish\nbetween the real and the unreal, between the true and the false, between the transient and the\npermanent, is indispensable for the serious spiritual aspirant. The wise possess and exercise this faculty,\nthe eye of wisdom, by deeply examining whatever is presented to them and discerning whether it is the\ngood or the merely pleasant they are being confronted with. Intelligence comes into the foreground,\nfeeling and emotion being banished from the mental field altogether. Human beings operate either\nrationally or instinctually-emotionally. The wise are rational at all times. At all times. For example, real\nlove is clearsighted\u2013never blind\u2013whereas infatuation masquerading as love is both blinding and\nblindness.\nPreferring and driven\nIf two people are walking, one toward the north and the other toward the south, the difference between\nthem is very little\u2013just the direction they are facing. But in the matter of the wise and the foolish the\ndifferences are profound, for they are rooted in their very being, especially the mind and intellect. Even\nas a child I always thought that the statement of Abraham to Lazarus that \u201cbetween us and you there is\na great gulf fixed,\u201d was spiritually symbolic, that a great gulf did indeed lie between the Godwards and\nthe earthwards. The upanishad is outlining this nature of this gulf for us by describing its effects on\nboth.\nThe wise prefer the good\u2013they are not enticed, coerced, or \u201csomehow drawn\u201d to the good. They\nintelligently\u2013yes, intellectually\u2013prefer it because they know its nature and its effects. This is true of\neverything in their life, mundane, mental, and spiritual. This is markedly true in the matter of religion.\nThe religious expression of the wise is always, peaceful, clear, intelligent, informed, and practical\u2013it\nworks.\nThe foolish, however are not so. They truly are a \u201ctroubled sea\u201d \u201ctossed to and fro, and carried about\nwith every wind\u201d as Isaiah and Saint Paul observed. \u201cDriven by fleshly desires,\u201d it only follows that\nthey prefer the pleasant to the good, for the \u201cflesh\u201d cannot even perceive the good to any appreciable\ndegree; but they create a lot of illusions about it\u2013all negative and self-assuring. Their religion is\nsubhuman, of course, catering to their emotions and their demands for the indulgence of their whims\nand vices. However educated they may be, or how boring and dry their church services, still animality\nreigns and all manner of subhuman behavior is sanctioned and even elevated and \u201cspiritualized.\u201d\n\nWallowing in the sty of their comforting and indulgent religion, they cast many a contemptuous (and\nsecretly guilty) glance at those who are not so, and create many a bon mot about their \u201cunnatural denial\nand repressions\u201d hinting of sinister implications for those who \u201crun away from life\u201d and \u201crefuse to face\nthemselves,\u201d and \u201cexpect too much from themselves and others.\u201d But they are still only talking pigs.\nEven though they like to say they are \u201conly human\u201d and that God understands they are.\nDriven by pleasure/pain, their humanity becomes submerged in the animality impressed in their\nsubconscious by millions of incarnations in subhuman forms. Merely possessing a human body is no\nguarantee of humanity. The redoubtable Dr. Bronner in a conversation with one of the monks of our\nashram referred to some people as \u201cnot yet HUMAN!\u201d He was right. A house does not make a home\nand a human body does not make a human. Humanity only dawns when intelligence dominates and\nwisdom is gained. We need not be intellectual in the academic sense, but we must be intelligent. Then\nif we use our intelligence there is a chance we may become wise and thereby cross the great gulf.\nThe plain facts\nChances are Nachiketa never got voted \u201cmost popular\u201d of anything and may not even have been \u201ca\ngood mixer.\u201d But Yama assessed him quite highly, saying: \u201cThou, O Nachiketa, having looked upon\nfleshly desires, delightful to the senses, hast renounced them all. Thou hast turned from the miry way\nwherein many a man wallows.\u201d Now this is a thumbnail portrait of a wise human being, but it is a test\nof the wise and the foolish. The wise will accept it and the foolish will not. So we should take a square\nlook at it and our reaction will tell us which we are.\nFirst of all, Nachiketa is not naive or \u201cinnocent.\u201d He knows what is going on, even if most things\nshould not be going on. He has not turned away, but has deeply looked into the desires of the flesh and\nthe delights of the senses. He knows what the fake life of the foolish is all about, and he has renounced\nit ALL\u2013not just a little bit or even most, but the whole mess. Why? Because he does not identify with\nthe flesh and the senses, but with the intelligence and his true self that is pure consciousness. He knows\nhe is not the perishable body.\n\u201cThou hast turned from the miry way wherein many a man wallows,\u201d says Yama. Nachiketa sees that\nthe world of body-sense enslavement is a suffocating bog\u2013not just ugly and repulsive to the wise, but\ndeadly. He knows, with Jesus, that: \u201cYe cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d He also knows that in reality\nonce a person has reached the level of human evolution he cannot really live like an animal without\ndire consequences, including terrible suffering. As humans we have simply gone beyond that to which\nthe foolish cling to so obsessively.\nThis is strikingly illustrated in Jesus\u2019 parable of the Prodigal Son found in the fifteenth chapter of Saint\nLuke. After wasting his inheritance, the man hired himself out to a pig farmer. This is a symbol of\nsomeone who has enslaved himself to the lower nature and the senses\u2013pigs that wallow in filth, eat\ngarbage, and demand more. \u201cAnd he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did\neat: and no man gave unto him.\u201d Like nearly all of us, the poor soul wants to feed on and be satisfied\nwith the garbage that the pigs revel in, grunting: \u201cThis is living!\u201d But it cannot be; we are not pigs; we\nare not the senses or the body.\nNo matter how much we desire to regress to animal living, we cannot really do so. And usually only\npain will wake us up from such folly. When we do wake up, like the Prodigal we will resolve: \u201cI will\narise and go\u201d forward in the path of evolution, leaving the sty and its pigs behind. The rising and the\ngoing will not be easy, but there simply is nothing else for a true human being to do. Moreover, the path\nwill not be long, though it may seem so, for time drags when we are having struggle and pain. Jesus\nindicates this, saying: \u201cwhen he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and\n\nran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\u201d All the perfected souls that have taught us about spiritual life\nhave assured us that the effort required of us is but a token\u2013nevertheless a token that must be paid. If\nwe can but get a glimpse or conceive a bit of what it will be to have arisen and travelled the way, then\nthe price will seem so small. Amazingly, Saint Paul tells us that Jesus \u201cfor the joy that was set before\nhim endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\u201d\nJust think: the joy. This should be our perspective, too.\nAgain, renunciation is the way of immortality.\n\nThe Way of Ignorance\nThe Two Ways\nYama, the King of Death, praises Nachiketa, saying: \u201cFar from each other, and leading to different\nends, are ignorance and knowledge. Thee, O Nachiketa, I regard as one who aspires after knowledge,\nfor a multitude of pleasant objects were unable to tempt thee.\u201d\nIt is interesting to note that the concept of Two Ways of human life are to be found in all religious\ntraditions. Jesus spoke of the Broad Way and the Strait Way, and when they met in Jerusalem and\nissued a joint spiritual letter, his apostles began by saying there are two Ways in this world. Long\nbefore that, the Katha Upanishad spoke of the Way of Ignorance and the Way of Knowledge.\nThe Way of Ignorance is the subject of the three verses we will be considering, but first Yama tells us\nthe key trait of one who aspires to knowledge: he cannot be tempted by the pleasant. This is because he\nsees its nature and its results. The pursuers of the Way of Ignorance are not such as Nachiketa, and\nYama now tells us about them and the results of their walking in that Way.\nThe Way of Folly\n\u201cLiving in the abyss of ignorance yet wise in their own conceit, deluded fools go round and round, the\nblind led by the blind.\u201d That certainly is plain speaking! Let us go through this verse bit by bit.\nLiving in the abyss of ignorance. This word \u201cabyss\u201d is very disturbing in this context. It indicates that\nthe condition of ignorance is profound\u2013not something than can easily be removed or escaped. Rather,\nthe person is sunk deep into the darkness of ignorance, so deep that he cannot see anything but\ndarkness, so deep that he can hardly be extricated from it\u2013at least in this life. It is not that his condition\nis utterly hopeless, but that he simply has neither awareness nor interest. If that dawns, he is on his way\nout of the abyss. But most of the time it does not happen. In a routine of the Firesign Theatre, a disease\nis described with the concluding words: \u201cThe only cure for which is death.\u201d In many (actually most)\ncases of abysmal ignorance this is the truth. The individual requires another birth before he can arise\nfrom the depths. Until then he should be left alone.\nYet wise in their own conceit. Somewhere I read the words: \u201cThe problem with ignorance is that it picks\nup confidence as it goes along.\u201d Since ignorance is a by-product of ego, as ignorance increases so does\negotism. Increasing in this alternating cycle, invincible arrogance and invincible ignorance arise, take\nhold and consume the ignorant person. This is really an ugly picture; but an accurate one. Thinking\nthemselves wise, how can the ignorant ever see the truth about themselves\u2013both the higher and the\nlower selves\u2013and try to rectify themselves? They cannot. Not content to revel in their private kingdom\nof ignorance, they then set about to aggressively expand it through influence of others. And if they\ncannot influence they will dominate and bully until they have extended their sphere of darkness. Again:\n\nugly but accurate. Living in the fantasy-land of ego, they sink deeper, believing that they are rising.\nDeluded fools go round and round. Cycling in confusion, the foolish spiral downward, seeming to go\nup and down but really only going down and down. In their minds they veer back and forth, up and\ndown, agitating themselves and others, but in actuality they just keep on sinking. Because of this they\ncontinually go round and round in the wheel of birth and death, perpetually bound to the torture wheel\nof samsara\u2013and reveling in every moment. They have discovered the secret of happiness in this world:\nunconsciousness.\nThe blind led by the blind. Ignorance as well as misery loves company, in fact needs it desperately and\nthrives on it. Supporting each other they stumble through this world until death claims them and they\nget to do it all over\u2013and over and over. When they are not being the leader and the led, they are the\npusher and the pushed, the dominating and the dominated, the victimizer and the victim\u2013alternating in\nthese two roles, they reel onward and downward.\nBlind to eternity\n\u201cTo the thoughtless youth, deceived by the vanity of earthly possessions, the path that leads to the\neternal abode is not revealed. This world alone is real; there is no hereafter\u2013thinking thus, he falls\nagain and again, birth after birth, into my jaws.\u201d\nRendered heedless of the truth about his condition through involvement with materiality\u2013both his body\nand objects in the world\u2013and deluded by what he thinks is going on, the ignorant never sees the way\nbeyond the abyss in which he dwells. He simply cannot see it, just as we cannot hear frequencies\nbeyond the range of our hearing or see things beyond the range of our sight. He is deaf and blind to\nspirit in all its aspects. Even if by some chance he should seek the way, if he finds it he will not know\nit, nor if he come face to face with the way will he realize it. Just the opposite. He will despise and\ndeny it, even denouncing it as delusive or evil. On the other hand, he will exult in devilish religion,\nteachers, and practices, seeking them out and devoting himself to them. Let me give two examples I\nknow of personally.\nA great master used to plead with a young man to learn meditation, assuring him that his progress\nwould be rapid and he would be liberated in this life. But he did not get initiated. When the master was\nabout to leave his body he told his disciples that if the man ever came to the ashram and expressed an\ninterest, one of them was to initiate him immediately. He never did. But a dozen or so years later one of\nthe biggest frauds the \u201cyoga world\u201d has ever produced came to town charging money for a worthless\ntechnique. The man was in poor financial condition, and could not really afford it, but he immediately\nslapped down the cash and got initiated into nothing.\nTwo Buddhist friends of mine visit a prison and instruct the inmates in Buddhist philosophy and\nspiritual practice. They are practicers of the Pure Land School of Buddhism. Whenever they try to get\nthe prisoners to chant the liberating name of Amida Buddha they refuse and insist that they chant\nTibetan \u201cpower mantras\u201d instead. They love bondage and lust after control. They belong where they\nare.\n\u201cThis world alone is real; there is no hereafter\u201d is thought by many of the foolish, but there are many\nmore who do not actually think it but live as though they did. Denial of spiritual realities is done more\nby deeds than by words. It does not matter how devoutly or spiritually we may think, if we live\ncarelessly and materially, as centered on our ego as any ignoramus we would regard as \u201cunspiritual.\u201d\nThis is the real test. Thinking the material world alone is real, the ignorant return to it again and again,\n\nliving in the jaws of death. If we do the same, then we are fools. If we do not, then we are wise.\n\nThe Mystery of the Self\nSeeing is not always seeing and hearing is not always hearing. In some instances it is misperception,\nand in others it is no perception at all. This is illustrated by an incident from the life of Jesus. While\nspeaking to the people, he prayed: \u201cFather, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,\nsaying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people therefore, that stood by, and heard\nit, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.\u201d Four levels of perception are manifested\nhere. One level knew that God had spoken, another thought that an angel had spoken, another thought it\nhad only thundered, and the fourth did not hear a thing.\nAs a rule, phenomena can be classified in fours. The four castes spoken of in Indian scriptures are not\nsocial strata based on physical birth, but four levels of awareness\u2013in fact, they correspond to the four\nresponses to the speaking of God that Saint John has recorded in this Gospel passage. Krishna follows\nthe same classification in the Bhagavad Gita, saying: \u201cThere are some who have actually looked upon\nthe Atman, and understood It, in all Its wonder. Others can only speak of It as wonderful beyond their\nunderstanding. Others know of Its wonder by hearsay. And there are others who are told about It and do\nnot understand a word.\u201d But it is the Katha Upanishad we are looking into at the moment, so let us see\nwhat Yama had to say to Nachiketa about this matter of understanding the Self (atman).\n\u201cTo many it is not given to hear of the Self. Many, though they hear of it, do not understand it.\nWonderful is he who speaks of it. Intelligent is he who learns of it. Blessed is he who, taught by a good\nteacher, is able to understand it.\u201d\nThe \u201csilent\u201d majority\n\u201cTo many it is not given to hear of the Self.\u201d Most people\u2013by far the most people\u2013have never heard of\nthe Self and never will in this lifetime. Oh, yes, they will hear about an immortal soul/spirit that a\ntyrannical God will reward or punish according to His whim, but the real nature of that spirit as part of\u2013\nand therefore one with\u2013the Supreme Reality and therefore supreme reality itself, eternal, immortal, and\nindivisible, will never be even hinted at nor will they come up with the concept on their own. Further, it\nwill not be even suggested to them, either from within or without, that the spirit nature is the Self\u2013\nnothing more\u2013and is the only true identity they can ever have.\nBeing unchanging, this Self cannot be affected or changed by anything\u2013no, not even by God. It is what\nit is, just as much as God is what He is. It is, therefore, not only the most worthwhile thing for us to get\ninvolved with, it is the only thing we can possibly be involved with. Everything else is illusion. This\nglorious truth of the Self, known only to the seers of Sanatana Dharma (there are others in various\nreligions that hold this, but they are looked upon as mavericks and heretics by those groups), must be\nthe sole perspective in which we view our present situation as consciousnesses experiencing the\nprocess of evolution. (It is the ever-shifting dance of prakriti to which we have become attached that\nevolves; we are ever the same, ever the One.)\nLiving in the silence of ignorance, what can they do? Not much, obviously.\nThe uncomprehending\n\u201cMany, though they hear of it, do not understand it.\u201d This is true of many who, though ostensibly\nadherents to Sanatana Dharma, really do not get the idea\u2013especially about the Self. These are those that\n\nfrequent temples, ashrams and saints as a kind of insurance against calamity and trouble. Then there are\nthose that only run to those holy places when problems arise. Obviously they have no degree of\ncomprehension regarding the Self.\nNeither do most who profess to understand the Self. This is seen by their words and deeds. If someone\nbelieves the building is on fire we can tell it by their attempts to get out. Similarly, if someone believes\nin the truth about the Self they will order their entire lives accordingly\u2013not just assent to the concept.\nTo know the Self, to enter into the fullness of its consciousness and being, will be the focus of their life\nand thought.\nSri Ramakrishna often said that if a thief learned of a great treasure being kept in the room next to\nwhere he was living, he would not be able to sleep for thinking about how to break through the wall\nand get it. In the same way, those who really understand about the wonder of the Self will not rest until\nthey have (re)claimed the Treasure for themselves. Spiritual purification and spiritual practice are the\nmeans for breaking through the wall and claiming the prize.\nWe have a dilemma here, also: Only those who understand about the self will be motivated to engage in\ntapasya to realize it fully; yet only those who are engaged in tapasya can have any glimmer of the self\nand be motivated to practice! The solution lies in the fact that in time the Self begins to urge us to its\nrealization, that we will intuit the presence of the Self and start moving toward the point where, when\nwe hear about it, we will accept and act upon what we hear.\nIt is interesting to see that Yama does not mention those who reject or deny the truth of the Self.\nApparently to him they do not even exist.\nWonderful\nWe joke sometimes about the exaggerations of the theatrical and motion picture industries. \u201cIt is\ncolossal! Magnificent! The greatest ever!\u201d and suchlike continually pour out in conversation and\nadvertisements. The song, Hollywood, assures us that out there \u201cyou\u2019re \u2018terrific\u2019 if you\u2019re good.\u201d\nDivinity, on the other hand, has a somewhat different viewpoint, so Yama tells Nachiketa: \u201cWonderful\nis he who speaks of it.\u201d He is not speaking of a parrot, a spiritual phonograph, but of one who speaks\nwith awakened awareness\u2013even if not from perfect knowledge or realization. \u201cFor out of the abundance\nof the heart the mouth speaketh.\u201d The implication here is that we should seek out and only listen to\nthose who speak of the Self, from the Self, and in the perspective of the Self. Theology is usually only\nso much distracting noise, and so is most \u201creligious\u201d and \u201cspiritual\u201d talk. Buddha likened a true teacher\nor teaching to a finger pointing at the moon\u2013only that which points us to our own Reality is itself real\nand worthwhile. Such a teacher or teaching is wonderful indeed.\nIntelligent\nThe word \u201cstupid\u201d gets tossed about in casual conversation as much as does \u201cwonderful,\u201d and no one\nrelishes being thought stupid. (Few care whether they actually are stupid, just as long as nobody notices\nor points it out.) Yama, with his very definite perspective, assures Nachiketa that the intelligent person\nis the one who pursues knowledge of the Self. This is done in two ways: listening to or reading the\nteachings about the Self of those who have themselves known the self, and\u2013most importantly\u2013by\nactively seeking to know one\u2019s own Self through careful analysis (swadhyaya) and spiritual practices,\nmost especially meditation. This latter point is very necessary for us to grasp. Intellectually intelligent\npeople love learning\u2013and they should. However, it is easy to fall into the trap of studying all the theory\nand not getting down to any practice to determine the validity of the theory.\n\nSaint Silouan of Athos said that delight in the study of theology was the false mysticism of the ego.\nWhen Swami Turiyananda first met Sri Ramakrishna he was intensely studying Vedanta for at least six\nhours a day. Upon hearing of this, Sri Ramakrishna was astounded. \u201cWhat else does Vedanta say except\nthat Brahman alone is real, the world is illusory, and the Self and Brahman are one?\u201d he asked. \u201cSo\nwhy do you need six hours of study for that?\u201d Turiyananda had the good sense to understand, and\nbegan to devote himself to japa and meditation in order to know the Self\u2013not just know about the Self.\nIn the West it is a common error to assume that knowing about something is the same thing as knowing\nit. More than once I have read in catechisms that knowing God is accomplished by reading the\ncatechism! That is stupid.\nBlessed\nTo be wonderful and intelligent is good, but to be blessed is the ideal. So Yama concludes: \u201cBlessed is\nhe who, taught by a good teacher, is able to understand it.\u201d This is because a good teacher does not just\nimpart theoretical knowledge, but reveals to the student the practical means by which he can open his\nunderstanding through meditation to behold and know the Self. Krishna, being the Supreme Teacher,\ninstructs Arjuna in the Gita about meditation, saying: \u201cIf he practices meditation in this manner, his\nheart will become pure.\u201d \u201cHe must be\u2026united constantly with me in his meditation.\u201d \u201cThe practice of\nserenity, sympathy, meditation upon the Atman, withdrawal of the mind from sense-objects, and\nintegrity of motive, is called austerity of the mind.\u201d \u201cMake a habit of practicing meditation, and do not\nlet your mind be distracted. In this way you will come finally to the Lord, who is the light-giver, the\nhighest of the high.\u201d\n\nHow to Either Know or Not Know the Self\nLet the student (who is often a \u201cbuyer\u201d) beware\n\u201cThe truth of the Self cannot be fully understood when taught by an ignorant man, for opinions\nregarding it, not founded in knowledge, vary one from another. Subtler than the subtlest is this Self, and\nbeyond all logic. Taught by a teacher who knows the Self and Brahman as one, a man leaves vain\ntheory behind and attains to truth.\u201d\nBy \u201cthe truth of the Self\u201d is meant both the philosophical, scriptural truth and the direct perception of\nthe truth experienced in meditation. However Yama is at this point speaking more on the side of\nlearning the intellectual truth about the Self, its nature, and its possibility of realization.\nWe all know the incredible and impenetrable tangle of theologies that constitute what most people think\nare the religions of the world. The reason for this is simple: most (almost all) teachers of religion are\nfundamentally ignorant. Ignorant not in the intellectual sense, but in the intuitive sense. Since we do\nneed an intellectual road map to help us in our search for direct experience of the Self, this is a serious\nmatter. For an attempt to figure out the truth of the Self in a purely theoretical manner will only add to\nthe prevailing confusion. We will just become one more voice in the cacophony of ignorant religion or\nphilosophy. Nothing is worse than an ignoramus that believes he has an \u201cinside track.\u201d As Jesus\nobserved: \u201cIf the \u2018light\u2019 that is in thee be [actually] darkness, how great is that darkness!\u201d\nConsequently, it is a most detrimental thing to come into the orbit of an ignorant teacher and accept his\nwords\u2013and even worse to act on them. Some years back there was a most interesting motion picture\ncalled Apprentice to Murder. It was based on the actual experience of a man who as an adolescent came\ninto contact with a \u201cwise man\u201d in the southern hills. This man conducted a kind of church whose\nmembers studied a nineteenth-century book of what might be called folk magic. He had genuine\n\npsychic abilities and really did work miracles. This boy became his student and ended up being jailed\nas an accomplice in the man\u2019s murder of someone he considered a \u201cblack magician.\u201d This is a rather\ndrastic example, but frankly it is much less destructive in the long run than involvement with many\ncontemporary teachers, some of the worst of whom are in the yoga world. To be confused is worse than\nbeing merely ignorant, and being flawed and distorted by wrong yoga practices is even worse.\nBeyond the intellect\n\u201cSubtler than the subtlest is this Self, and beyond all logic,\u201d says Yama. Being subtler than the subtlest,\nthe Self cannot possibly be perceived by any sense\u2013including those of the subtle bodies\u2013or conceived\nof by even the highest and subtle reaches of the intellect. Yet, the Self can be known. This is possible\nonly when \u201ctaught by a teacher who knows the Self and Brahman as one, a man leaves vain theory\nbehind and attains to truth\u201d through the practice of meditation, instruction in which a qualified teacher\nwill give. This really marks out the knowledgous teacher from the ignorant teacher. The ignorant\nteacher will only expound theory, \u201cproving\u201d what he teaches by intellectual means. The worthy teacher\nmay say much the same words, but will point the student to the means by which he can attain the vision\nof the Self. He will establish the student in the practice of correct meditation, without which nothing\nthat is real can possibly be known.\nA bit more. Yama tells us that the teacher should be one who knows\u2013not a rhetorician or theoretician.\nNow it is impossible for us to look into the consciousness of a teacher, so how will we know he has real\nknowledge? We cannot in an absolute sense, but Yama gives us a trait that at least assures us the teacher\nis not altogether astray: He will affirm the oneness of the Self and Brahman. No matter how cleverly,\nconvincingly, and cutely he may speak, however much he may appeal to our emotions and deluded\nintellects, if he does not insist on the unity of the Self and Brahman, saying with the Chandogya\nUpanishad \u201cTHAT THOU ART,\u201d he is unworthy and to be turned away from. Unhappily, there are a lot\nof ignoramuses who appeal to egotistical fools by saying: \u201cYou are God.\u201d The true teacher says not that\nwe are God, but that God is us. There is an infinite difference. Furthermore, the real teacher does not\njust tell us this fact, he instructs in the means to find it out for ourself. These two traits must be present\nbefore we even begin to think about accepting a teacher as a valid guide.\nThe ultimate test of a teacher is our own capacity, made accessible to us by his instruction, to leave all\nspeculation behind and enter into the Reality that is both Brahman and the Self while remaining ever\nOne. Then all the gods and sages will say of us what Yama said of Nachiketa: \u201cThe awakening which\nthou hast known does not come through the intellect, but rather, in fullest measure, from the lips of the\nwise. Beloved Nachiketa, blessed, blessed art thou, because thou seekest the Eternal. Would that I had\nmore pupils like thee!\u201d\n\nFrom the Unreal to the Real\nEternal values\nThere is an obscure Protestant song entitled \u201cWith Eternity\u2019s Values in View.\u201d Musically it is not much,\nbut philosophically it is profound. We are not temporal, mortal beings, and if we live our life as though\nwe were, then only confusion and chaos can result. Instead we must see ourselves as eternal beings\npresently dreaming the dream of evolution\u2013a dream whose culmination is awakening, toward which all\nof our attention and awareness should be focused. Nachiketa knew this, but Yama underlined it, telling\nhim:\n\u201cWell I know that earthly treasure lasts but till the morrow. For did not I myself, wishing to be King of\n\nDeath, make sacrifice with fire? But the sacrifice was a fleeting thing, performed with fleeting objects,\nand small is my reward, seeing that only for a moment will my reign endure.\u201d What are a billion years\ncompared to eternity? Not even a glimmer. Why, then, do we scramble after such short-lived earthly\ngoals, goals that even if attained prove to be worthless since they vanish away so quickly? Why do we\ncontinually deny our eternity and affirm the delusion of temporality? Because we identify thoroughly\nwith that which is temporal and finite.\nBuddha and two fools\nBuddha once encountered two deluded ascetics. One always behaved like a dog and the other like a\nwater buffalo. No explanation is given for their behavior. Perhaps it related to some deity worshipped\nby them. For example, a dog would be related to Bhairava, a form of Shiva, and a water buffalo to the\ngoddess Durga. However it might be, they wanted to know from Buddha what the results of their way\nof life would be. He refused to answer, but they kept insisting, so he told them plainly that if they were\nlucky they would be reborn as a dog and a water buffalo, and if they were unlucky they would find\nthemselves in astral hells corresponding to their aberrative life and thought. As anticipated by Buddha,\nthey wailed and fussed and went away without gaining any sense or rectifying their foolish ways. We\nare just like them, except we are hypocrites, claiming to believe in the eternal, unconditioned Self and\nacting just the opposite.\nThe dilemma of the gods\nIt is true that there is nothing on this earth we cannot attain if we put forth the effort. In previous\ncreations human beings performed elaborate rituals to become \u201cgods\u201d in this creation, including\nBrahma the creator. They succeeded, and the result was that they suffer more pain and anxiety than\nhuman beings do and are more subject to mental aberrations than humans. Furthermore, they are bound\nuntil the end of this creation cycle to fulfil their offices and can in no way shirk or abandon them. So\nthey are more bound than any human being could ever be. In other words, their heaven has turned out\nto be a hell. Still their main anxiety is fear over falling from their exalted status and returning to human\nform. They have learned nothing from their experience. (Do we?)\nA metaphysical fact\n\u201cBut the sacrifice was a fleeting thing, performed with fleeting objects, and small is my reward, seeing\nthat only for a moment will my reign endure.\u201d Within this lament of Yama is embedded a profound\ntruth regarding spiritual life.\nOnly the spirit is eternal and everlasting. Everything else, however highly evolved or sacred, is\ntemporal and impermanent. However long-lived they may be, in time they will dissolve back into the\nprimal energy of manifestation and we will lose them\u2013never really having \u201chad\u201d them at all.\nConsequently, the wise seek only for the eternal spirit, though using the material and the temporal to\naid them in their search. For example, physical health is not enlightenment, but it certainly makes the\nenlightenment process easier. Material sufficiency relieves us from anxiety and helps us pursue\nspiritual life without distraction. And so forth.\nDiscipline is essential for material life, and even more so for spiritual life. Yet, discipline will not take\nus to the goal\u2013it will greatly facilitate our going, but we must never mistake proficiency in any\ndiscipline or practice for spiritual attainment. In the same way, any type of yogic practice that does not\ndeal directly with Consciousness will not result in enlightenment. Like discipline, it may help us in our\nascent to higher awareness, but it must not be mistaken for that awareness.\n\n\u201cSadhana\u201d means spiritual practice that leads to the revelation of the Real (Sat). The temporal does not\nlead to the eternal, therefore real sadhana must begin and end in spirit consciousness. No material\nprocedure is sadhana, nor is any externally-oriented practice sadhana. The only true sadhana is the\nturning inward of the mind and the perception of the inmost spirit. In other words, meditation alone is\nsadhana\u2013meditation free of all mechanics and gimmicks, simple and direct, leading to the ultimate\nSimplicity that is the Self. We must begin with spirit if we are to end with spirit. That is why Patanjali\nbriefly outlines the nature of God, telling us that \u201cHis manifesting Word is Om,\u201d and concluding: \u201cIts\njapa and meditation is The Way.\u201d For constant japa/meditation utilizing the Eternal Om will render us\nan Infinite Reward.\nIn just a few more verses the Katha Upanishad encapsulates it thus: \u201cOf that goal which all the Vedas\ndeclare, which is implicit in all penances, and in pursuit of which men lead lives of continence and\nservice, of that will I briefly speak. It is\u2013OM. This syllable is Brahman. This syllable is indeed\nsupreme. He who knows it obtains his desire. It is the strongest support. It is the highest symbol. He\nwho knows it is reverenced as a knower of Brahman.\u201d\nThe truth\nAll truth is a two-edged sword. It tells us what IS and what IS NOT. The truth about the Self and\nBrahman also tells us what is not the Self or Brahman. Those of us who are clinging to the unreal will\nfind this painful or at least uncomfortable. But we have to let go of the unreal to lay hold of the Real. If\nwe do not like this fact we need not bother with Real, but keep on whirling around in our little hamster\nwheel we call life. But the wise listen and act upon Yama\u2019s next words to Nachiketa:\n\u2018The goal of worldly desire, the glittering objects for which all men long, the celestial pleasures they\nhope to gain by religious rites, the most sought-after of miraculous powers\u2014all these were within thy\ngrasp. But all these, with firm resolve, thou hast renounced.\u201d\nTo enter into Life we turn away from all fulfillments of material and temporal desires, no longer\nattracted by their false glitter. Nor do we aspire to some heaven or heavenly pleasures offered to us by\nego-oriented religion\u2013things that also end as painfully as the joys of earth. Even miracles mean nothing\nto us, for they occur only in the realm of duality, the realm of death.\nWhere is Life?\nSeeing that Nachiketa was yearning to pass from death to Immortality, Yama continues: \u201cThe ancient,\neffulgent being, the indwelling Spirit, subtle, deep-hidden in the lotus of the heart, is hard to know. But\nthe wise man, following the path of meditation, knows him, and is freed alike from pleasure and from\npain.\u201d\nFirst of all, before analyzing this, it must be realized that Yama is talking about us. Certainly, we are\nfinite and God is infinite, but substantially (essentially) we are the same. So Yama is talking about our\ntrue nature in these amazing words, and we should consider them accordingly.\nAncient\nWe are puranam\u2013ancient. God is called the Purana Purusha, the Ancient Person. Since we coexist with\nHim, we, too, are ancient. Shankara in his commentary explains that in this context puranam does not\njust mean incredibly old, but everlasting. That is, we, too, are primeval beings. \u201cThere was never a time\nwhen I did not exist, nor you, nor any of these kings. Nor is there any future in which we shall cease to\nbe,\u201d Krishna tells Arjuna in the Gita.\n\nOur eternity is very hard for us to grasp even theoretically because we have been caught in the timespace web for ages beyond calculation. Creations have come and gone as we barely crawled along the\nevolutionary path. We just cannot conceive of eternity, for it is not time without end, it is that state of\nbeing which lies beyond time. Actually, we are living in that state right now, but have completely lost\nsight of it and imagine we are immersed in the sea of constant change, of constant birth and death with\ntheir attendant sufferings.\nTo view ourselves as eternal, immortal beings is therefore most important, for without that perspective\n\u201clife\u201d will totally overwhelm us, drowning us in illusions without either numbering or end. Yet when\nwe step back, withdrawing our consciousness into our own reality, it will end instantly. It is the\nstepping back and withdrawal that takes the time.\nEffulgent Being\nDevam means \u201cshining one.\u201d We are ourselves \u201cthe light that shines in darkness\u201d for we are a living\npart of the Light of Life. Consequently we must turn within for illumination. Until we are perfected in\nthat in-turning we do need some external lights such as holy books and teachers, but it is unwise to\nbecome dependent on any outer source of knowledge. Eventually we must get it all from within, having\nbecome swayamprakash, self-illumined.\nCertainly we should be discontented with our present ignorant and bound state of being, but there is no\nroom here for condemning or loathing ourselves for being sinners, weak, foolish, etc. Our discontent\nwith our present state should arise from our conviction that we are ourselves divine\u2013for devam means\nthat as well. We are living far beneath our selves. Knowing that, we should turn around, stop our\ndescent, and begin ascending to our real place\u2013far beyond any childish heaven or relative condition of\nany type however exalted.\nSince we are self-effulgent, all guidance must eventually come from within. We may not be able to tap\nthe inner light right now to the needed degree, but in time our atma alone must be our guide through\nand beyond this life. We must learn to rely on our capacity for pure Knowing.\nAs a child and a young man I looked upon myself as a \u201cBible-believing Christian,\u201d so naturally I\nbelieved that Jesus Christ was the Light of the World. But it was only when I found the wisdom of the\nUpanishads that I really believed Jesus when he said: \u201cYe are the light of the world.\u201d For the\nfundamental necessity is to realize that we are the Light also. \u201cGod is light\u201d and so are we, for we and\nGod are one, not two. No one who claims to be spiritually enlightened can teach otherwise, \u201cfor with\nthee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.\u201d The Light of God reveals the Light of our\nown Self. The closer we get to our real self, the closer we come to God, and vice versa. Then \u201cthe sun\nshall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the\nLord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.\u201d For we shall know ourselves as\nLight and Glory. This is not egotism, for in the Light the ego melts away. \u201cThe path of the just is as the\nshining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\u201d\nIndwelling Spirit\n\u201cIndwelling spirit\u201d not only tells us that we are pure consciousness by nature, but the important fact\nthat our consciousness is the noumenon which dwells at the heart of all phenomena. That wherever\nthere is any \u201cthing\u201d there are we as the reality that is the substratum of all existence\u2013even of illusion.\nThat is why we find our selves if we pierce the veil of illusion or look within. We are omnipresent.\nSubtle\n\nWe do not perceive the Self because our conditionings from aeons of relative existence has coarsened\nour perceptions. Experiencing materiality over and over and over again has oriented and confined our\nawareness to the grossest levels of existence. Further, it has oriented and confined our awareness to\nexternalities. Any reflective person can readily understand the need to turn our awareness inward to\nperceive the self, but more is needed: we must refine our minds, rendering them more and more subtle\nso they can eventually see the Most Subtle: the Self.\nMeditation refines the mind no doubt, but we have to do more than that, otherwise an entire life will\nsimply not be enough time to produce the requisite refinement. Therefore Patanjali in Yoga Sutras\n2:30,32 lists the necessary means for the physical and psychic refinement without which the Self\ncannot be realized to any degree. They are:\n) Ahimsa: non-violence, non-injury, harmlessness\n2) Satya: truthfulness, honesty\n3) Asteya: non-stealing, honesty, non-misappropriativeness\n4) Brahmacharya: sexual continence in thought, word and deed as well as control of all the senses\n5) Aparigraha: non-possessiveness, non-greed, non-selfishness, non-acquisitiveness\n6) Shaucha: purity, cleanliness\n7) Santosha: contentment, peacefulness\n8) Tapas: austerity, practical (i.e., result-producing) spiritual discipline\n9) Swadhyaya: introspective self-study, spiritual study\n10) Ishwarapranidhana: offering of one\u2019s life to God\nAll of these deal with the innate powers of the human being\u2013or rather with the abstinence and\nobservance that will develop and release those powers to be used toward our spiritual perfection, to our\nself-realization and liberation. Equally important is their effect on our minds: harmonization,\nstrengthening, and refinement.\nThese ten factors and successful meditation are actually interdependent. Without meditation they are\nimpossible to accomplish, and without their steady and complete observance meditation becomes\nimpossible. This is why after nearly forty years of the \u201cyoga boom\u201d in this country nothing significant\nhas been accomplished spiritually. A lot of money has been made, organizations formed and exalted\nover the lives of their members, and a great deal of folly and neurosis has resulted (what to say of\nvirulent scandals) but that is all. Why? Because these ten needful elements are utterly omitted from the\nspheres of their existence. They are never mentioned, much less advocated. The only exception is\nahimsa\u2013limited only to opposition to war. This is because everybody wants to be nice and the pop-yoga\nmovement was born during the \u201cHell no, we won\u2019t go!\u201d war-protesting hip era. However, the most\nobvious personal application of ahimsa: advocacy of abstention from the eating of animal flesh, is\nusually absent.\nThe sensible aspirant cannot do otherwise than make these ten disciplines part of his life if he truly\nwishes to render himself capable of beholding the Self and living as the Self.\nDeep-hidden in the lotus of the heart\n\nWhy are we out of touch with God and our Self? Because we are skimming on the surface of \u201cthings\u201d\nwhile Reality is \u201cdeep-hidden in the lotus of the heart\u201d\u2013the Core of All. Actually, Reality is deephidden in the core of the things we are experiencing. We only need to see into them to find the True.\nThat is why in Buddhism we find the word Penetration so frequently used. We must See Deeply. That\nis, we need not turn away or withdraw from outer phenomena, but rather develop the capacity to see\ninto them to their ultimate Depth. To do this we do enter inside through meditation, but since there\nreally is neither Inside nor Outside in the truest sense, in time\u2013through the practice of meditation\u2013we\ncome to see all there is to see: The One.\nHard to know\nWe have all experienced getting a mistaken idea or impression stuck in our head that we could not get\nrid of even when we knew better. The same is true of habit patterns. Living in conditioned existence we\nourselves have become conditioned\u2013or at least we identify with the conditionings of the ever-shifting\nmind. This is the only reason that the Self is hard to know. It has nothing to do with the nature of the\nSelf, but with the conditioning of the mind\u2013conditioning resulting from billions and billions of\nlifetimes as everything from an atom of hydrogen onward to where we are now. It is not easy to undo in\na few years what we have taken thousands of creation cycles to build up! Yet it can be done and will be\ndone in time. We just have to understand the way things work and that it will take time. Nevertheless,\nthe words \u201chard to know\u201d assure us that the Self can be known.\nThe way and its effects\n\u201cBut the wise man, following the path of meditation, knows him, and is freed alike from pleasure and\nfrom pain.\u201d It is the path of meditation that leads to Self-knowledge, none other.\nThe uncontrolled mind\nDoes not guess that the Atman is present:\nHow can it meditate?\nWithout meditation, where is peace?\nWithout peace, where is happiness?\nIt is not that Self-knowledge renders us incapable of experiencing pleasure or pain, but of being in\nbondage to them\u2013that is, being subject to reaction to pleasure and pain.\nThe bonds of his flesh are broken.\nHe is lucky, and does not rejoice:\nHe is unlucky, and does not weep.\nI call him illumined.\nTo obey the Atman\nIs his peaceful joy;\nSorrow melts\nInto that clear peace:\nHis quiet mind\nIs soon established in peace.\n\nFinding the Treasure\nAll the world seeks happiness. Our American Declaration of Independence says that the pursuit of\n\nhappiness is an inalienable right for every human being. But see how miserable people really are\nbeneath the frantic veneer of the pursuit of happiness in an ever-changing and pain-producing world.\nThe problem? We are looking in the wrong direction. We are seeking outward when we should be\nseeking inward. We are seeking the non-self instead of the Self. From the Katha Upanishad we learn\nthe right line of action.\n\u201cThe man who has learned that the Self is separate from the body, the senses, and the mind, and has\nfully known him, the soul of truth, the subtle principle\u2013such a man verily attains to him, and is\nexceeding glad, because he has found the source and dwelling place of all felicity. Truly do I believe, O\nNachiketa, that for thee the gates of joy stand open.\u201d\nSeparate\n\u201cThe Self is separate from the body, the senses, and the mind.\u201d Therefore the body, senses, and mind\ncannot even \u201csee\u201d the Self as an object, and certainly cannot possibly experience the Self to any degree.\nThe happiness experienced by body, senses, and mind is not true happiness at all, but an approximation,\na sham that distracts us from the real thing, inevitably leading us to frustration and all-around misery.\nThis must be learned. Then the Self itself must be known.\nSoul of truth, subtle principle\nThe Self is the very soul of Truth, of Reality. It is not just the basis of reality, it IS reality. Apart from it\nthere simply is nothing. It is subtle beyond all conception\u2013but not beyond all experience. It is when we\nenter fully into the Being that is the Self, that we \u201cattain to him,\u201d that boundless happiness shall be\nours. For the Boundless itself shall be ours.\nSource and dwelling\nYama then tells us an important fact: the Self is the source of all and the dwelling place of all felicity.\nNow this is most intriguing. We are saying that the Self is all there really is, and then we hear that it is\nthe source of \u201call.\u201d This is the key to true non-dual comprehension. Sri Ramakrishna explained that at\nfirst we follow the path of negation saying \u201cNot this, not that,\u201d the idea being that everything we can\nsee or think of is not the Real. But when we come to the real end of that approach\u2013which is not just\nintellection or mind-gaming, but the inner path of meditation\u2013and turn back we will say \u201cALL this!\u201d\nThat is, we will see that everything is the Real, that the unreal was only our way of seeing and\n(mis)understanding it. The whole world, said Sri Ramakrishna, will then be seen as \u201ca mart of joy.\u201d\nUnless this is understood at the beginning we will end up being just another dyspeptic world-and-lifedenying grouch, claiming that our dryness and grimness is jnana (wisdom). \u201cThere is a state beyond\nbliss, you know,\u201d grated one of them to a friend of mine who dared to find joy in the Self. India\nabounds with these anatmic misfits and we have plenty of them in the West, too. (One is too many.)\nAll that is dwells in\u2013is rooted in\u2013the Self and is therefore an expression of divine Ananda. What a\nwonderful world-view: one that sees not \u201cthe world\u201d but Spirit. We do not go from one point to another\nto pass from the unreal to the Real, from darkness to the Light, from death to Immortality. It is only a\nmatter of changing our base of perception. This is the real alchemy, changing the lead of mundane\nexperience to the gold of supernal joy.\nThe conclusion\nNo one is excluded from this glorious truth, it extends to all and is vital to all in an equal degree. No\none is nearer or farer from the Self\u2013it embraces all. This is the real Gospel\u2013the Evangelion, the Good\n\nNews humanity needs so desperately: \u201cTruly, for thee the gates of joy stand open.\u201d\nLet us pass through them!\n\nThe Transcendent Reality of the Self\nPreviously Yama has spoken to Nachiketa of the manner to experience the Self that is immanent in all\nthat \u201cis.\u201d Now he completes the picture by an exposition of the Transcendent and the means to realize\nIt. He does this in response to Nachiketa\u2019s question: \u201cTeach me, O King, I beseech thee, whatsoever\nthou knowest to be beyond right and wrong, beyond cause and effect, beyond past, present, and future.\u201d\nHe desires to know about the Transcendental Reality that is beyond all qualities or designations. As the\nImmanent Being, That has infinite names, forms, conditions, and qualities, but beyond that is\nsomething much greater: the Transcendent. That can neither be said to exist or not to exist, to be with\nform or without form, with qualities or without qualities, for all these propositions are dualities, one\npresupposing the other. Where there is one there is its opposite\u2013duality is an absolute in the realm of\nthe Immanent Reality. Nachiketa is certainly pleased with the truth that all can be seen as the Divine\nUnity, but he wishes to complete his knowledge by learning about what lies beyond even that. Sri Ma\nAnandamayi, when discussing these things, always insisted on the point that there is a state in which\neven the question of duality/unity, form/formless, and such like cannot even arise. That is the state\nNachiketa aspires to comprehend and experience.\nThe answer is in the question\nEverything in manifestation is dual. This is the truth for every aspect of life. There is an interesting\ndivinatory process known as The Alphabet of the Magi. To \u201cwork\u201d it a question is formulated and then\nwritten on cards\u2013one letter per card. These cards are then shuffled and dealt out in a special way\n(unknown to me) to form the words that are the answer to the question! It was The Alphabet of the\nMagi, worked by a Benedictine monk who practiced divination and astrology in Paris after his\nmonastery had been closed by the anti-religious government, that inspired Charlotte Corday to\nassassinate Marat and inspired Napoleon, then a mere corporal, to aspire to the rulership of France. So\nit works.\nThe idea that the answer is inherent in the question is very important, for it means that the questioner\nalready knows the answer on the subconscious (or superconscious) level, that the question cannot arise\nuntil the answer is subliminally known. The purpose of questioning, then, is to bring out on the\nconscious level what is known unconsciously. When we seemingly ask another to teach us we are really\nseeking to stimulate and bring forth our own knowledge. That is why the wise have assured their\nstudents that in time they would be able to find the answers within themselves\u2013it is only a matter of\ndeveloping intuition through clarifying the mind.\nIt is very common to hear someone demand: \u201cWhy did you ask me if you are not going to accept what I\ntell you?\u201d The reply should be: \u201cSo I can figure the answer out for myself.\u201d The very fact that we reject\na given answer indicates that we think we do know what is the truth about the matter. Otherwise we\nwould mindlessly accept what we are told. (Many do, alas.) It is all inside us. Questioning reveals the\nripening of our innate knowledge. Knowing this, Jesus said: \u201cAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and\nye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that\nseeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\u201d He is not urging us to seek outside\nourselves, but to seek within.\nNachiketa seems to be asking Yama about the Transcendent, but his question reveals how much he\n\nalready knows.\nBeyond right and wrong\nThe moment we enter duality\u2013relative existence\u2013we become subject to the situation that some\nthoughts, words, and acts will impel us onward to higher consciousness and others will impel us to\nlower consciousness. No matter where we may \u201cbe\u201d at the moment, it cannot be permanent. By the\nnature of things we will keep moving up and down, back and forth. Whenever we think we have\nattained some stability it is only a matter of the movement being so slow it is imperceptible to us. We\nare always in danger of incurring suffering because of this. In truth, suffering is inevitable, for even\nrising requires effort and unsureness or doubt as to the success of our endeavor. As Krishna says of us:\n\u201cAnxiety binds them with a hundred chains.\u201d We suffer anxiety as to what is the right or wrong and\nanxiety as to whether we can avoid the wrong and manage to think and do the right. Even more, we are\nbusy getting and losing, anxious to get the good and rid ourselves of the wrong. And of course we are\nmostly deluded as to what is really right and wrong, usually thinking that the pleasurable is right and\nthe painful is wrong. That is why Krishna told Arjuna: \u201cBoth the good and the pleasant present\nthemselves to men. The wise, having examined both, distinguish the one from the other. The wise\nprefer the good to the pleasant; the foolish, driven by fleshly desires, prefer the pleasant to the good.\u201d\nThe danger is obvious.\nNachiketa intuits that this terrible dragging back and forth, this dilemma inherent in \u201cexistence,\u201d can\ncome to an end\u2013not in the realm of relative existence, but in its transcendence. Realizing the truth that\ntrying to \u201crise above\u201d any of the dualities is as foolish as trying to make dry water or cold fire, is a\ntremendous breakthrough for the developing consciousness and indicates that the end of the search is\nnear. Some of our monks visited a great saint in the Himalayan foothills and spoke with him about\nspiritual life. He told them: \u201cYour questions show that you are not far from the Goal.\u201d\nBeyond cause and effect\nIn ignorant religion \u201csin\u201d and \u201crighteousness\u201d occupy a great deal of attention, not necessarily because\nof a sincere desire to be virtuous, but because of their effects. Desire and fear motivate the religionist\u2013\nat least mentally and emotionally\u2013for sin gets punished and righteousness gets rewarded. Punishment\nhurts and reward feels good. Punishment takes away and reward supplies. The dispenser of reward and\npunishment is some kind (or many kinds) of deity who, being an extension of the ignorant egos of the\nadherents of the religion, judges good and bad on the basis of \u201cI like\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t like,\u201d \u201cI want\u201d and\n\u201cI don\u2019t want.\u201d Good sense and practicality have nothing to do with it. The deity is either pleased or\ndispleased and acts accordingly. To complicate matters, the deity can be placated if \u201csinned against\u201d\nand, being mollified by groveling and penitence, will reward the sinner as much as if he had been\nvirtuous\u2013maybe even more, so the deity\u2019s \u201clove\u201d and \u201cmercy\u201d can be revealed. We see this behavior in\nhuman beings all the time: tears, apology and self-castigation not only stop the anger or displeasure,\nthey evoke a tenderness and openness that should sensibly only be evoked by right conduct. So in evil\nreligion (for ignorance is evil), despite the assurance that virtue is rewarded, we see that sin and\nrepentance are rewarded and the sinner assured of salvation. Such a religion becomes a living hell\npopulated and promoted by living demons.\nI expect that just about everyone reading these words are congratulating themselves on having gotten\nout of or avoided such religion. Ah, the sane wisdom of the East. Really? Do we not see that \u201cgood\nkarma\u201d and \u201cbad karma\u201d are bugaboos just as much desired and feared as any heaven or hell proffered\nby Western religion? I knew a man that had a metaphysical bookstore. Shoplifting was a real problem.\nNow, if he had put a sign on the door so the departing malefactors would have read something like:\n\n\u201cThou shalt not steal,\u201d or \u201cThe soul that sinneth it shall die,\u201d or \u201c\u201cKnow thou that God will bring thee\ninto judgment,\u201d it would have had no result\u2013perhaps even the opposite. For after all, were not his\ncustomers \u201cbeyond all that\u201d Judeo-Christian negativity? Indeed they were! So he did this. He put a sign\non the door for all to see as they departed saying: \u201cShoplifting is Bad Karma.\u201d Nearly every day that\nsign stopped at least one person. Most sheepishly shuffled back to the shelf and sneaked the book back.\nSome actually came to the owner and gave him the book along with an apology. Why? Had he evoked\ntheir higher moral sensibilities? Not a bit. They had traded fear of sin and hell for fear of bad karma\nand retribution\u2013maybe even a bad rebirth. The ego was still in the driver\u2019s seat, and quite liable to stay\nthere for a long time. Karma may be more \u201cscientific\u201d a concept than sin, punishment, and hell, but the\nfear engendered is just as egoic, and therefore just as negative and ultimately ignorant.\nNachiketa had a clear vision of things. The problem was not tears or smiles, but the LAW of cause and\neffect, the truth that for every action there is an equal responsive reaction. Reactivity, inner and outer, is\nalso inherent in relative\u2013dual\u2013consciousness. But Nachiketa did not just want to get away from the\nnoise and damp of the ocean of samsara, he wanted to get away from the ocean itself. A jail cell may be\nmiserable or luxurious, but it is still a prison. Nachiketa aspired to freedom. He wished to attain that\nwhich was beyond cause and effect, not just a means of avoiding them. This is one of the reasons why\nreligion is usually so pointless: it attempts to make the fire stop burning rather than showing the way\nout of the conflagration. It seeks to make bondage palatable, pleasing to both the egocentric deity and\nthe egocentric devotee. A confederacy of dunces, indeed.\nBeyond past, present, and future\nMy first reading of the Bhagavad Gita revealed to me something I had intuited all my life: the\nfundamental truth that space and time are utter illusions, basic delusions of human consciousness. What\na relief! So when in three or four days I heard one of the most intelligent of my university professors\nremark that time and space were the two fundamental realities, you can imagine how much I\nappreciated the Gita for clearing that nonsense up for me. (I appreciated myself, too, for being so clever\nas to understand it.)\nThe time-space continuum is a torment to the awakened consciousness, for it is the basis for the\nexistence of cause and effect and therefore of right and wrong. It is impermanence itself, the root cause\nof all suffering, fear, anxiety, and instability. Since we have been immersed in relativity for creation\ncycles beyond number, we find ourselves in a present whose vast roots are thoroughly unknown, and\nwhose effects will create an unknown future that will be a fusion of the past and the \u201cpresent present.\u201d\nUncertainty and confusion are the results of even a small attempt to make sense of the whole thing.\nAnd the idea of controlling any aspect is simply beyond our imagination. We are drowning in a\nshoreless ocean. But we do not just drown once and have it over with. We drown daily\u2013every moment,\nactually. Only the stupid or the willfully ignorant do not see this. How can we blame those who take\nrefuge in illusion, whatever the form? They do not need an analysis or judgment of their predicament;\nthey need a way out. Nachiketa is asking for that, not for more philosophy or exposition of the\nproblem.\nTranscendent being\nThere is not a \u201cplace\u201d beyond right and wrong, beyond cause and effect, beyond past, present, and\nfuture, but a state of being that transcends them. Nachiketa sought to become an altogether different\norder of being, to enter into the state of Brahman Itself. Knowing this to be so, Yama does not hesitate,\nbut literally spells it out. He begins:\n\u201cOf that goal which all the Vedas declare, which is implicit in all penances, and in pursuit of which\n\nmen lead lives of continence and service, of that will I briefly speak.\u201d\nGoal\nThat which Nachiketa seeks is not an abstraction but a positive reality known to Yama. Perhaps the\nmost heartening thing that can be said about That Which Is is the fact that it is The Goal. Its attainment\nis not only possible, it is inevitable. The entire field of relative existence, however much we have\ndamaged or corrupted it, and it in turn has damaged or corrupted us, has a single purpose: the\nattainment of Brahman and the consequent liberation of the questing spirit (atman). This is what\neverything is all about. So no wonder we have made such a mess of things\u2013literally. Not knowing\neither their or our purpose, what else could be the result? We are like the character in the Woody Allen\nmovie that tried to play the cello by blowing through the holes. Ignorance is the root of all the trouble.\n\u201cShake off this fever of ignorance. Stop hoping for worldly rewards. Fix your mind on the Atman. Be\nfree from the sense of ego,\u201d counsels Krishna. \u201cYou dream you are the doer, you dream that action is\ndone, you dream that action bears fruit. It is your ignorance, it is the world\u2019s delusion that gives you\nthese dreams.\u201d \u201cSeek this knowledge and comprehend clearly why you should seek it: such, it is said,\nare the roots of true wisdom: ignorance, merely, is all that denies them.\u201d \u201cWhen men have thrown off\ntheir ignorance, they are free from pride and delusion. They have conquered the evil of worldly\nattachment. They live in constant union with the Atman. All craving has left them. They are no longer\nat the mercy of opposing sense-reactions. Thus they reach that state which is beyond all change.\u201d\nVedas\nBy \u201cvedas\u201d Yama means the teachings of illumined sages regarding the nature of Brahman and the way\nto conscious union with Brahman. For \u201cveda\u201d means knowledge or wisdom. Although that word has\ncome to be used only in the sense of the ancient Sanskrit hymns found in the Rig, Sama, Yajur, and\nAtharva Vedas, they are not meant here. At the time of Nachiketa the vedas were the orally transmitted\nwisdom of the Vedic Rishis that only later were written down as the upanishads. In a broader sense, the\nvedas are the words of any enlightened person about the nature of God and the realization of God.\nBooks of speculative philosophy mean nothing to our search for Divine Consciousness. Only the\nteachings of those who have themselves reached the Goal are relevant and worthy of our attention.\nImplicit in all penances\nThe word rather poorly translated here as \u201cpenances\u201d is tapasya. Literally it means the generation of\nheat or energy, but is always used in a symbolic manner, referring to spiritual practice and its effect,\nespecially the roasting of karmic seeds, the burning up of karma. Tapasya means a practical\u2013i.e., resultproducing\u2013spiritual discipline which culminates in spiritual evolution and enlightenment.\nThe important idea in Yama\u2019s words are that our spiritual practice must be congruent with the nature of\nGod. Though tapasya implies a discipline, it cannot just be some type of militaristic coercion or\n\u201cmortification\u201d of the body and mind that are often nothing more than an expression of self-loathing.\nThe religions of the world abound in admiration for those who torture the body and mind, attaining\nabnormal psychic states foolishly mistaken for spiritual attainment. But according to Yama, the Goal\nmust be implicit in all disciplines. That is, the disciplines themselves must embody the nature of God\u2013\nand our own selves, as well. A person unfamiliar with spiritual truth should be able through analysis of\nauthentic practice to actually come to understand the truth regarding the nature of both the seeker and\nthe Goal. If a spiritual practice cannot impart this knowledge by its very mechanics, then it is invalid\nand cannot possibly lead to the Goal. For this is a very valuable fact: only that practice which from the\nvery first moment puts us in touch with God and begins to reveal our true nature is genuine yoga. All\n\nelse is illusion. That is why Krishna says: \u201cWhat is man\u2019s will and how shall he use it? Let him put\nforth its power to uncover the Atman, not hide the Atman: man\u2019s will is the only friend of the Atman:\nhis will is also the Atman\u2019s enemy.\u201d The plain truth is that putting the force of the will into erroneous\npractices will hide the Truth from us even more, whereas applying the will in correct practice will\nreveal Divinity to us. For Divinity is inherent in true yoga.\nIn pursuit of which\u2026\nThe upanishads teach us the truth of the unity of the atman and Brahman. Therefore that truth is known\nas advaita, \u201cnot two,\u201d meaning that there is no separation of the atman and Brahman at any time.\nSimplistic thinkers, especially in the West, immediately begin to decry the idea of tapasya, yoga, or any\nother discipline, insisting very shrilly that there is no need for such, that to engage in spiritual practice\nis to affirm a delusion of separation between us and God. They usually end up denying that either we or\nGod even exist, advocating a kind of petulant, bullying nihilism, reminding any sensible person of\nKrishna\u2019s indictment: \u201cThese malignant creatures are full of egoism, vanity, lust, wrath, and\nconsciousness of power. They loathe me, and deny my presence both in themselves and in others. They\nare enemies of all men and of myself.\u201d Drastic words, these, but they address a drastic mental and\nspiritual aberration. Read the entire sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita for a full outline of such\nkinds of people. This is but one of the reasons why a continual study of the Gita is necessary for those\nwho do not wish to go (or be led) astray in their spiritual pursuit. No student of the Gita could ever fall\ninto such absurd pitfalls as these \u201cadvaitans\u201d whose only unity is their absorption in the illusion of the\nego.\nThe truth is that the realization of God not only can but must be pursued. We do not pursue God,\nunderstand, for God is everywhere and always one with us. Rather, we pursue the revelation of that\neternal oneness and its manifestation on all levels of our present existence. Regarding this, a yogi-adept\nof the twentieth century, Dr. I. K. Taimni, remarked in his book The Science of Yoga: \u201cAccording to the\nyogic philosophy it is possible to rise completely above the illusions and miseries of life and to gain\ninfinite knowledge, bliss, and power through enlightenment here and now while we are still living in\nthe physical body. And if we do not attain this enlightenment while we are still alive we will have to\ncome back again and again into this world until we have accomplished this appointed task. So it is not a\nquestion of choosing the path of yoga or rejecting it. It is a question of choosing it now or in some\nfuture life. It is a question of gaining enlightenment as soon as possible and avoiding the suffering in\nthe future or postponing the effort and going through further suffering which is unnecessary and\navoidable. This is the meaning of Yoga Sutra 2:16: \u2018The misery which is not yet come can and is to be\navoided.\u2019 No vague promise of an uncertain postmortem happiness this, but a definite scientific\nassertion of a fact verified by the experience of innumerable yogis, saints, and sages who have trodden\nthe path of yoga throughout the ages.\u201d\nIt is absolutely sure: \u201cSeek, and ye shall find.\u201d\nBrahmacharya\nBrahmacharyam is the word Swami Prabhavananda translates as \u201clives of continence and service.\u201d\nRadhakrishnan renders it \u201cthe life of a religious student,\u201d and Swami Sivananda: \u201clife of a\nbrahmacharin.\u201d In India the first stage of life is that of a student, a brahmachari. The brahmacharistudent leads a life of discipline, the core of which is sexual continence\u2013a concept utterly lacking in\nother cultures as their present disintegration reveals. He also serves his teacher in a practical way, for\nthe ideal environment of the brahmacharya ashram is rural, a forest setting being the ideal. At the time\nthe upanishads were first spoken, all Aryas lived in the forests, living an agrarian life of the utmost\n\nsimplicity. The students of a teacher helped out in the day-to-day routine required by such a lifestyle.\nBut Yama is not confining brahmacharya to the student\u2019s stage of life, and in \u201cmodern times,\u201d whatever\nthe age or outer circumstances of the seeker, it would consist of both self control (abstinence) and\npractical positive action, including selfless service.\nI once saw a cartoon in which a drunk was lying in a gutter and asking a Salvation Army woman: \u201cCan\nyou save me here, or do I have to go somewhere?\u201d Obviously, being \u201csaved\u201d did not interest him very\nmuch. But those who are truly interested say with the Prodigal Son: \u201cI will arise and go.\u201d And they do.\nLiving a life of purity and discipline is the way they rise and go.\nBriefly speak.\nIt is most significant that Yama says he will briefly speak of the Goal. Why is this? Because the Goal is\nBrahman, and Brahman can only be spoken of very briefly. This is because Brahman is exceedingly\nsimple, in fact the only really simple (incomplex) \u201cthing\u201d there is. Also, the intellect can only grasp the\ntiniest bit of the truth about Brahman, so not only can little be said, little can be understood. In a way\nthis makes it very easy for us. Here is how the Gita teaches us about Brahman:\n\u201cNow I shall describe That which has to be known, in order that its knower may gain immortality. That\nBrahman is beginningless, transcendent, eternal. He is said to be equally beyond what is, and what is\nnot.\u201d \u201cLight of all lights, He abides beyond our ignorant darkness; Knowledge, the one thing real we\nmay study or know, the heart\u2019s dweller.\u201d\nBut Nachiketa does not want to know about Brahman, he wants to know Brahman. With this in mind,\nYama reveals both Brahman and the way to Brahman\u2013for they are the same\u2013by saying:\n\u201cIt is\u2013OM.\u201d\nYou cannot be briefer than that. Nor do you need to be. Yama has said it all, for Om is the embodiment\nof The All.\nHe has, as I say, said it all, but Yama continues with a brief exposition of the nature of Om.\nOm is Supreme Brahman\n\u201cThis syllable is Brahman. This syllable is indeed supreme. He who knows it obtains his desire.\u201d\nOm is Brahman. It is not a symbol of Brahman, It IS Brahman. Om is not even a word\u2013It is the very\npresence of Brahman. \u201cOm is not counted among words,\u201d said Sri Ramakrishna. \u201cIt is not a word, it is\nGod Himself,\u201d said Swami Vivekananda. This assertion is borne out by the fact that in Sanskrit Om is\nnot treated as a word\u2013that is, It does not go through any changes in form according to its grammatical\nposition or status. It has no plural, possessive, subjective, objective, or adjectival forms. It is always\njust \u201cOm\u201d and nothing else.\nI could cite a great many authoritative statements affirming the divine nature of Om, but I recommend\nour publication, The Glories and Powers of Om, which contains under many headings the scriptural\nstatements on Om.\nObviously Om is supreme, being Itself the Supreme. But Yama has made this seemingly obvious\ncomment to convey the fact that Om is the supreme means to the realization of the Supreme. There is\nnothing higher than Om, nor is there any means of spiritual cultivation higher than Om. That is why\nPatanjali simply said: \u201cIts repetition and meditation is the way.\u201d\n\nYama then tells Nachiketa that he who knows Om obtains whatever he desires. Many upanishads state\nthat Om encompasses all existence and therefore literally is all things, that all things are formed of Om\njust as all clay pots are made of the single substance, clay. Since all things are contained in Om, it can\nonly follow that he who truly knows Om by uniting his consciousness with It through Its japa and\nmeditation shall attain all that he desires as a matter of course. Such a wise one, will of course desire\nonly That which fulfills all desire: Brahman. Commenting on this very verse, Swami Vivekananda said:\n\u201cAy, therefore first know the secret of this Om, that you are the Om\u2026.\u201d Om is the ending of all desire\nby being the fulfillment of all desire.\nThe strongest and the highest\n\u201cIt is the strongest support. It is the highest symbol. He who knows it is reverenced as a knower of\nBrahman.\u201d The need for security is fundamental to human existence. This is especially true in relation\nto spiritual life. Even a little observation reveals how incredibly fragile spiritual consciousness and\nspiritual activity is in human life, for everything militates against it and overwhelms it. Observing this,\nJesus\u2019 disciples asked him: \u201cLord, are there few that be saved?\u201d And he assured them that indeed few\nmanage to be saved. The New Testament Greek word translated \u201csaved\u201d is sodzo, which means to be\nsafe in the sense of delivered from danger or harm. It also means to be healed and become whole.\nSalvation in the view of Jesus and his disciples was not having sins forgiven and allowed into heaven,\nbut was the same as the upanishadic sages: Liberation (Moksha). All shall eventually attain liberation,\nbut only a few at a time do so. Not because it is so difficult, but that so few even conceive of it, and\neven fewer persevere in the pursuit of it. Jesus quoted the Gita in his discourses and was certainly\nfamiliar with Krishna\u2019s words to Arjuna: \u201cWho cares to seek for that perfect freedom? One man,\nperhaps, in many thousands. Then tell me how many of those who seek freedom shall know the total\ntruth of my being? Perhaps one only.\u201d\nWith this perspective, Yama tells Nachiketa that Om is the strongest and highest support. Swami\nPabhavananda translated alambana the second time as \u201csymbol\u201d no doubt thinking of Om as an object\nof meditation. Although its supporting power is most important in relation to spiritual life and practice,\nYama makes no such explicit qualification, so we can be sure that Om is the empowerment and support\nof everything positive in our life. This, too, is asserted many times in the upanishads.\nKnower of Om\u2013knower of Brahman.\n\u201cHe who knows It is reverenced as a knower of Brahman.\u201d Some translators render this: \u201cHe who\nknows It is revered in the world of Brahman.\u201d For a knower of Om is translated into that world, having\nbeen transmuted into Brahman through Om. It is no wonder, then, that the Mundaka Upanishad says\nabout Om: \u201cDismiss other utterances. This is the bridge to immortality.\u201d\nOm is our self (atman)\nHow can Om have such an incredible effect upon us? Because we are Om. It is our own self (atman).\n\u201cThe Self, whose symbol is OM, is the omniscient Lord. He is not born. He does not die. He is neither\ncause nor effect. This Ancient One is unborn, imperishable, eternal: though the body be destroyed, he is\nnot killed.\u201d\nIf Brahman was not at the core of our being, as the core of our being, we could not possibly become\none with Brahman. All talk of \u201cbecoming\u201d is of course not really accurate if we think of it as becoming\nsomething we are not. Rather, it is the becoming aware of, becoming established in, our eternal unity\nwith Brahman. Some years ago, workers in a Burmese temple were moving a huge plaster image of\n\nBuddha with heavy equipment. Something went wrong and the image was dropped. To their\nastonishment the plaster, which was only a layer a few inches thick, broke and fell off, revealing that\nthe image was solid gold! Centuries before it had been covered with plaster to protect it from thieves.\nToday it is considered the single most valuable image of Buddha in the world. We are like that. A layer\nof relative existence has been plastered onto our consciousness for so long that we think we are the\nplaster. When the plaster was broken the image was revealed to be gold, and when our \u201cplaster\u201d is\nbroken we shall be revealed as parts of Brahman, waves of the One Ocean of Being.\nWe shall then know that we are not born, we do not die, we are neither cause nor effect; we are unborn,\nimperishable, eternal, unaffected by any conditions of the body whatsoever. For as Shankara sang:\nI am not the mind, intellect, thought, or ego;\nNot hearing, not tasting, not smelling, not seeing;\nI am not the elements\u2013ether, earth, fire, air:\nI am the form of Conscious Bliss: I am Spirit!\nI am neither Prana, nor the five vital airs;\nNor the seven components of the gross body;\nNor the subtle bodies; nor organs of action:\nI am the form of Conscious Bliss: I am Spirit!\nI have no aversion, clinging, greed, delusion;\nNo envy or pride, and no duty or purpose;\nI have no desire, and I have no freedom:\nI am the form of Conscious Bliss: I am Spirit!\nI have no merit or sin, nor pleasure or pain;\nNo mantra, pilgrimage, Veda or sacrifice;\nNot enjoying, enjoyable, or enjoyer:\nI am the form of Conscious Bliss: I am Spirit!\nI have no death or fear, no distinction of caste;\nNeither father, nor mother, nor do I have birth;\nNo friend or relation, guru or disciple:\nI am the form of Conscious Bliss: I am Spirit!\nI am without attributes; I am without form;\nI am all-pervading, I am omnipresent;\nBy senses untouched, neither free, nor knowable:\nI am the form of Conscious Bliss: I am Spirit!\nWe do not really need to become immortal and eternal, for we are that already. Instead we need to get\nbeyond the illusory consciousness of birth and death, cause and effect, and the entire range of relative\nexistence. The japa and meditation of Om is the Way.\n\nThe Immortal Self\nYama has just told Nachiketa that \u201cthough the body be destroyed, he [the Self] is not killed.\u201d Then he\ncontinues: \u201cIf the slayer think that he slays, if the slain think that he is slain, neither of them knows the\ntruth. The Self slays not, nor is he slain.\u201d Before considering this upanishadic passage, here is what the\n\nBhagavad Gita, the great digest of the upanishads, has to say about this:\n\u201cBodies are said to die, but That which possesses the body is eternal. It cannot be limited, or destroyed.\n\u2026Some say this Atman is slain, and others call It the slayer: they know nothing. How can It slay or\nwho shall slay It? Know this Atman unborn, undying, never ceasing, never beginning, deathless,\nbirthless, unchanging for ever. How can It die the death of the body? Knowing It birthless, knowing It\ndeathless, knowing It endless, for ever unchanging, dream not you do the deed of the killer\u2026.\u201d\nDreaming\u2013that is the key. God is dreaming the entire drama of the cosmos, but he knows it and controls\nthe dream. We, too, are dreaming the drama of our life, so Krishna tells us: \u201cYou dream you are the\ndoer, you dream that action is done, you dream that action bears fruit. It is your ignorance, it is the\nworld\u2019s delusion that gives you these dreams.\u201d The richest people in the world, if they dream they are\npenniless, suffer the frustration and fear of poverty just as keenly as do those who really are paupers.\nWhen they awake, the mental pain disperses, but it was no less real.\nThis is something we often miss when we subscribe to the theory of Maya. The experiences, such as\nbirth, death, and disease, may be illusion, but the suffering they produce is not. It is real. The grief we\nfeel at the death of a loved one is real, even if the death is not. That is why the Sankhya Karika, the\nbasic text of the Sankhya philosophy upon which the Yoga philosophy is based, opens with a discussion\nof suffering as our problem. Certainly, illusion should be dispelled, but that will not take care of the\ndeeper problem: our capacity for suffering. It is foolish and callous to bully those who suffer by\nexpounding on the unreality of that to which they are reacting. For there is no thing or situation which\ncan make us suffer. Suffering is our reaction to those things. When we reach the state where we no\nlonger react\u2013for pleasure is as destructive as pain\u2013then we will be free.\nPatanjali\u2019s dictum that yoga is the cessation of modifications of the chitta does not refer at all to restless\nthoughts in the superficial mind. He is speaking of the capacity for any kind of reactivity to outer\nstimuli. It is when we are unreacting and resting in our true self that we are in the state of Yoga. To\nmerely fiddle around with the shallow thinking mind, believing that calming it makes us yogis, is\ndeluding ourselves. Our problem is far, far greater and deeper than jittery thoughts. It is the capacity for\nsuffering and for being deluded. To be awake in the fullest sense is to be incapable of sleep and dream.\n(I am speaking metaphysically.) All the philosophy and analysis in the world will not help us. We need\nto awaken forever. That is what real yoga is all about.\nSlayer and slain are roles in the dream-drama of the evolving consciousness. If we know\u2013not just\nsuppose or believe\u2013this, then nothing can move us from the state of peace that is a quality of our true\nself. Fortunately for us all, the cliche about \u201cThere is naught but thinking makes it so,\u201d is bunkum,\nanother Western \u201ctruth\u201d that mercifully is false.\nThe body can be slain and can be a slayer. Being part of the dream, it really acts and is acted upon in\nthe dream context. The dreamer, however is not part of the dream, even when it projects an image of\nitself into the dream and slays or is slain. Nothing external can affect or change the internal reality.\nAgain, awakening is the only solution, and we should accept nothing less. Any view other than this\nwhich Yama presents to Nachiketa is but the blind leading the blind.\nA great flaw in the thinking of most of us is only accepting half of this great truth. We easily affirm our\nimmortality, saying: \u201cI can never die,\u201d and thus reject the idea that we can be slain. Yet we accept the\nconcept that we can be slayers, and make a great to-do about \u201csin\u201d and \u201ckarma.\u201d Is not that so?\nBecause we want to control the behavior of others by promising rewards and threatening punishments,\nwe have literally bought into this delusion and traded on it for life after life, fooling even ourselves.\nThough we find the truth in the upanishads or the Gita, we still keep on worrying about purifying\n\nourselves and clearing out our karma. Half-deluded, we stumble on, distracting ourselves from the real\ngoal, sinking deeper into the morass. Consider the lives of saints. So many of them have been great\nsinners, even murderers, or incredibly ignorant, and yet we see them either instantly entering into the\nstate of holiness or rocketing to it in a short time. The reason is simple: they had never committed a sin\nin their eternal lives. Like David, they awoke and found themselves with God.\n\nThe Indwelling Self\n\u201cSmaller than the smallest, greater than the greatest, this Self forever dwells within the hearts of all.\nWhen a man is free from desire, his mind and senses purified, he beholds the glory of the Self and is\nwithout sorrow.\u201d So Yama now tells Nachiketa.\nSmaller than the smallest, greater than the greatest\nWe tend to think of infinity as boundlessly large, when in actuality that which is infinite transcends\nspace and can therefore not be measured in any manner. It cannot be small or large. Which is why there\nis no thing too small or to great for God to be involved with. The Self, being a part of God, is likewise\nbeyond measurement. It is neither small nor large, gross nor subtle. In fact, the Self is simply beyond\ndescription. We can only talk around it, not really express its mystery.\nThis Self forever dwells within the hearts of all\nHowever, there are some things that can be said about the presence of the Self, therefore Yama does tell\nNachiketa that \u201cthis Self forever dwells within the hearts of all.\u201d\nThe Self is eternal. It has no beginning and it can never have an end. Whatever it is, it has been forever.\nWhat it is not, it shall never be. We say this glibly, but usually do not believe, and rarely manifest it.\nNevertheless, it is bedrock truth.\nThe Self, being beyond time and space, cannot possibly be anywhere. Yet we readily say that it is\nwithin. This is as close to the truth about the Self as we can get. At the core of all things, having itself\nneither periphery or core, is the unchanging Self. It \u201cdwells\u201d in the sense that it abides, yet the Self\ndoes not at all \u201cexist\u201d in the way we understand existence, which is completely relative. The Self is\nabsolute, and relativity can never affect or touch it.\nThe Self abides in the hearts of all. But what is the \u201cheart\u201d? Guha means both cave and heart, but it\nalso means to be \u201cin a secret place.\u201d Within the inmost heart of all things is that which transcends even\n\u201cinmost.\u201d That is the Self. And there is no thing whatsoever that does not have the Self as its eternal,\nunchanging indweller. The Self can be within all as their essential being only if the Self is all. This is\nthe Great Revelation. All that we see around us is resting upon the Self as the substratum. All that we\n\u201csee\u201d objectively is Maya, illusion. That which we cannot see, but which we can \u201cbe\u201d is the Self, the\nall-pervading subject.\nThis all sounds wonderful, but what possible meaning can it have if we do not experience this glorious\ntruth for ourselves? Nothing, obviously. So Yama proceeds to tell Nachiketa how the Self can be\nrealized.\nWhen a man is free from desire\nTo be truly free from desire is to be incapable of desire. To not be desiring anything at the moment is\nnot what is spoken of here. We mistakenly think that if we can become indifferent to all things and\n\nwant nothing we will be free from desire. But we will still be in the condition where desire is possible\u2013\neven if it be in the future\u2013or even a future life.\nTo desire something we have to feel inadequate, but even more fundamentally, we have to have\nobjective consciousness and a belief in the reality of the objects perceived, and a belief that in some\nway we can enter into relation with those objects, that we can affect them and they can affect us. What\na heap of delusions! Desire is only a symptom of profound ignorance and delusion. In itself it is no\nmore the problem than red blotches on the skin are the disease we call measles. (See? We even name a\ndisease as the symptoms.) However, true desirelessness\u2013and that is what Yama is speaking about\u2013is the\nstate of the liberated, those who know the Self.\nHis mind and senses purified\nA few years ago a valuable book was published by the Sri Ramakrishna Math in Madras: a translation\nof the Sankhya Karika by Swami Virupakshananda. In the Publisher\u2019s Note we find this: \u201cVedanta\ntakes off to ethereal heights only from the granite platform provided by Sankhya.\u2026Not only Vedanta,\nbut also modern science, cannot be understood in all their nuances without a firm grasp of the\nSankhyan tenets.\u201d And the translator writes: \u201cOf all the philosophical systems, the Sankhya philosophy\nis considered to be the most ancient school of thought. Sankhya philosophy maintains a prominent\nplace in all the shastras\u2026. In the Mahabharata it is said that there is no knowledge such as Sankhya and\nno power like that of Yoga. [On which Sankhya is based.] We should have no doubt as to Sankhya\nbeing the highest knowledge. (Shantiparva 316-2).\u201d Later he outlines how the Sankhya philosophy is\npresented in the Chandogya, Katha, and Svetasvatara upanishads particularly. And: \u201cIn the\nMahabharata and Puranas we find the Sankhya Philosophy fully explained.\u201d The second chapter of the\nBhagavad Gita (part of the Mahabharata) is entitled Sankhya Yoga, and Krishna mentions Sankhya by\nname as the truth he is expounding.\nI mention this because it is so common for students to approach the upanishads as exponents of the\nsimplistic monism that is erroneously thought to be Advaita. With this distorted frame of reference the\nupanishadic teachings that are very obviously opposed to their opinion are ignored. But we cannot\nafford the luxury of wilful ignorance. Simply babbling that \u201cIt is all one\u201d and \u201cWe are already there\u201d\naccomplishes absolutely nothing. And besides, it is not true\u2013in the simplistic sense they mean.\nGod, the Primal Purusha, is eternally associated with Prakriti (Pradhana) on the macrocosmic level, and\ncontinually projects and withdraws it as the ever-evolving creation. In the same way each individual\npurusha is eternally associated with prakriti on the microcosmic level and engages in a series of\nincarnations, evolving the personal prakriti to the point where it becomes a perfect mirror of the\nindividual purusha and there is a practical separation between the two, just as on the cosmic level. Let\nus not forget: Patanjali defines yoga (liberation) as a condition of the chitta\u2013of our personal prakriti\u2013not\na simple intellectual insight or \u201crealization.\u201d\nThe essence is this: Each one of us is evolving our own prakriti, just as God is evolving the universe.\nThe difference is that God is not caught in the drama, and we are. Sankhya states that we must learn to\nseparate our consciousness from its enmeshment in prakriti, but that is only the preparation. Then we\nmust engage in the process of bringing our prakriti to a state of perfection in which it no longer\nproduces waves, but becomes a permanently quiescent reflection of purusha\u2013of our true Self, which\nBuddhism calls our Original Face.\nThat process is Yoga, and Yama has this in mind when he speaks of the seeker having \u201chis mind and\nsenses purified.\u201d Merely reading a few books and hearing a few lectures on the nature of the Self will\nnot do it. We must focus our attention on/in the energy fields we call \u201cmind\u201d and \u201csenses\u201d and\n\ncompletely repolarize and reconstruct them. \u201cBe ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,\u201d wrote\nSaint Paul. Patanjali speaks of the process of kriya yoga, the yoga of purification, consisting of\nausterity (tapasya), self-study, and devoting the life to God. Yama, Saint Paul, Patanjali, and Krishna all\ntell us the same thing: \u201cBecome a yogi.\u201d\nHe beholds the glory of the Self\nThe Self cannot be intellectually conceived or spoken about, but it can be seen\u2013and thereby fully\nknown\u2013by the purified consciousness. And it is seen within the core of our being, within the cave of the\nheart. Caves are important symbols. Though they are to be found everywhere, we naturally think of\nyogis as dwelling in caves. Which they do, metaphorically. In the Gospels we see that Christ\n(Consciousness) is born in a cave and resurrects in a cave. It all takes place in the heart. Wherefore the\nwise Solomon said: \u201cKeep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.\u201d The practice\nof yoga (mediation) is the keeping of the heart which transforms the yogi\u2019s life.\nIt is said that Shiva sits immersed in samadhi, but occasionally awakens, arises, and dances in ecstasy,\nexclaiming over and over: \u201cO! Who I am! Who I am!\u201d The same wonder at the glory of the Self will be\nexperienced by the persevering yogi.\nAnd is without sorrow\nHow could there be sorrow or any slightest form of suffering or discontent for those who behold that\nglory and realize that they are themselves that glory? It can be said of such a one, as Arjuna said of\nKrishna: \u201cYou know yourself through yourself alone.\u201d And as Krishna said of the perfected yogi: \u201cTo\nobey the Atman is his peaceful joy; sorrow melts into that clear peace: his quiet mind is soon\nestablished in peace.\u2026Now that he holds it [the knowledge of the Self], he knows this treasure above\nall others: faith so certain shall never be shaken by heaviest sorrow.\u2026Who knows the Atman knows\nthat happiness born of pure knowledge: the joy of sattwa. Deep his delight after strict self-schooling:\nsour toil at first but at last what sweetness, the end of sorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Omnipresent Self\n\u201cThough seated, he travels far; though at rest, he moves all things. Who but the purest of the pure can\nrealize this Effulgent Being, who is joy and who is beyond joy.\u201d\nYama continues instructing Nachiketa on the nature of the Self. Being a highly developed being,\nNachiketa had doubtless intuited most of this already, but for us who were raised in the dry gulch of the\nWest and its \u201creligions\u201d his words are profoundly stirring\u2013astounding, actually. Who could believe that\nin this chaotic world there were ever\u2013and still are\u2013sages who by direct experience have seen and\nspoken these truths? We should analyze them carefully, not for mere philosophical exactitude, but for a\ngood, joyful revel in knowing the facts at last.\nUnmoving, he moves\nBeing rooted in Infinity and thereby beyond space, the Self can never \u201cgo\u201d anywhere. When we speak\nof the atma descending into relative existence or coming into matter, we are only describing the mayic\nexperience that is itself nothing more than a training movie. If we see a motion picture about Europe,\nwe do not think we have actually been there\u2013yet, we did see Europe. In the same way, under the spell\nof Maya we have all kinds of experiences, yet they are mere appearance only. \u201cAppearance,\u201d however\nis real, even if insubstantial. So we both are and are not here. I experience writing this, and you\nexperience reading it. That is real. But the environment in which we live, including our bodies, is but\n\nthe picture projected onto the formless screen of consciousness that is our Self.\nSo, going nowhere, the Self \u201cgoes\u201d everywhere. Being no thing, the Self \u201cbecomes\u201d all things. Doing\nnothing, the Self \u201cdoes\u201d everything. This is the way of it.\nUnmoved, he is the mover\nNothing affects the Self, but the Self affects all situations and things. Sankhya philosophy postulates\nthat although Prakriti never touches the Purusha, it is the proximity of the Purusha that causes Prakriti\nto move and manifest in manifold ways. In the West we find the expressions \u201cuncaused Cause\u201d and\n\u201cunmoved Mover.\u201d These apply to the individual Self as much as to God.\nThere is a very practical application of this fact. Being under the spell of Maya we think: \u201cAll this is\nhappening to me. All this is being done to me.\u201d But that is erroneous. We are making it all happen, we\nare \u201cdoing\u201d it to ourselves. There are no victims. Everything proceeds from us. Consequently we can\nstudy our lives and determine what is going on in our inner mind (which is not the Self, either). Our\nlives and environment are mirror images, revealing our states of mind. Our life is an exercise in\nconsciousness. There are computer games in which the images on the screen are actually manipulated\nby the player\u2019s mind and will. That is but a feeble glimpse of the truth about our entire chain of births\nand deaths. That is also what karma is. \u201cYou dream you are the doer, you dream that action is done, you\ndream that action bears fruit. It is your ignorance, it is the world\u2019s delusion that gives you these\ndreams.\u201d\nWho can know him?\nWe have a terrible conditioning. We believe that all knowledge must come from outside ourselves, that\nwe are blanks that need to be written on. In contemporary America this is very marked. Everybody\nthinks they need to have classes or lessons on everything. Some years back a friend of our ashram\npointed this out about horse-riding. She commented that everyone she knew took horse-riding lessons,\nin contrast to her children who just got up on a horse and rode. The she commented: \u201cEveryone thinks\nthey have to be taught to do anything, rather than learning on their own by experience.\u201d\nThis spills over into our philosophical life, too. We think we are dummies that have to have every\nnuance, every subtle point, taught to us\u2013and even worse, that they all have to be embodied in technical\nterms. It is only sensible to inquire about these things from those with more experience and knowledge\nthan ourselves, but childish dependence is no wisdom at all. Dr. Spock began one of his books my\ntelling new mothers that they knew much more about caring for babies than they thought they did, and\nto trust their inner feelings on the matter. This caused quite a stir. I was only a child at the time, and yet\nthe ripples of consternation even reached me through a magazine review of his \u201crevolutionary\u201d book.\nWe have no confidence, and spiritual laziness often compounds the problem.\nFor some reason Swami Prabhavanandaji gives us this translation: \u201cWho but the purest of the pure can\nrealize this Effulgent Being.\u201d That is so lofty, so noble, that frankly it paralyzes our aspiration\ncompletely. \u201cI am not \u2018the purest of the pure,\u2019 so how can I know the Self? I will have to ask others to\ngive me hints about it.\u201d But that is very mistaken. The actual upanishadic question is: \u201cWho else but\nmyself can know that radiant one [devam],\u201d the Self? This is not just an inspiring thought, it is perfect\ngood sense. Being the Self, who else but I can know my Self? Others may see the divine in me, but I\nalone can know the divine in me.\nIn the Chandogya Upanishad we have the thrilling story of Uddalaka instructing Svetaketu on the\nnature of the Self, saying to him over and over: \u201cThou art That.\u201d But however stirring that account may\n\nbe, Uddalaka is only telling him about the Self. It is up to Svetaketu to know the Self. Someone can\nbring us strawberries, show them to us, and even put them in our mouths, but we alone can know their\ntaste\u2013no one can taste them for us. In the same way, millions may tell us about our Self, but we alone\ncan really know It. It begins and ends with us. Self-knowledge is the most natural thing for us all. We\nare working very hard to produce and maintain the unnatural state of not knowing the Self. Once we\nget sensible and literally \u201cwise up\u201d things will change.\nJoy and beyond\nThe self is \u201cthis Effulgent Being, who is joy and who is beyond joy.\u201d We are ourselves devas\u2013gods.\nThere is no happiness or joy anywhere but in ourselves, for we are not happy or joyful by nature, we\nARE happiness and joy. The idea is that joy is the permanent, eternal, condition of our true Self. The\nword translated \u201cjoy\u201d in this verse is mada, which means delight, intoxication, and exhilaration. To\ndelight in our Self is the ultimate enjoyment. In the last essay I mentioned that it is said that Shiva sits\nimmersed in samadhi, but occasionally awakens, arises, and dances in ecstasy, exclaiming over and\nover: \u201cO! Who I am! Who I am!\u201d This is delight in the self.\nYet, Yama says that the Self \u201crejoices and rejoices not.\u201d He is trying to convey that the delight in the\nSelf is not delight in an object, but is totally subjective and inward-turned. This is very important, for as\nthe yogi develops through his sadhana, his prakriti-nature begins to reflect his inner joy more and more,\nand he can start delighting in the delight-reflection rather than in the real thing, and come to the\nconclusion that he has already attained the state Yama is speaking about. This is the state of\nshuddhasattwa, of extreme purity of the chitta, the mind-substance of the yogi. If he is not careful, he\nwill mistake the mirror image for his true \u201cface\u201d and believe he has attained what still lies before him.\nInnumerable are the yogis who have been deluded in this way and become trapped in the subtlest\nreaches of Maya. That is why Lord Krishna said: \u201cHow hard to break through is this, my Maya, made\nof the gunas!\u201d For to delight in the mere picture of the joy that is the Self is to still be trapped in\nobjective, outward-turned consciousness. As Krishna further tells us: \u201cOnly that yogi whose joy is\ninward, inward his peace, and his vision inward shall come to Brahman and know nirvana.\nHow do we avoid mistaking the image for the reality? By continuing to practice meditation and other\nspiritual disciplines until the moment the body drops off! A sure sign of a deluded individual is the\nbelief that he has gone beyond the need for meditation and other spiritual practices. \u201cBaba no longer\nneeds to meditate.\u201d \u201cBaba has transcended these things long ago.\u201d \u201cBaba is always in That, so such\nthings are unnecessary for him.\u201d (You can put \u201cMa\u201d in place of \u201cBaba\u201d if need be.) But what about\nSahaja Nirvikalpa Samadhi? Yes. What about it?\nA very famous Indian guru of the twentieth century believed that he had attained sahaja nirvikalpa\nsamadhi, so he announced that he no longer needed to meditate, since there was nothing more it could\ndo for him. While his disciples meditated, he stayed in his room and fiddled around with this and that.\nAfter some years he was visited by two Americans who thought of themselves as big guns on the\nAmerican spiritual scene. Not wanting to scandalize them by messing about while everyone else in the\nashram meditated, Sahaja Nirvikalpa Samadhi Baba started attending the meditation sessions and\nmeditating also. After a few days he remarked in wonder to a group of disciples that he could perceive\na very marked improvement in his mind and consciousness since starting to meditate daily, and\nexpressed wonder and puzzlement over how that could be. Unfortunately, no one had either the good\nsense or the courage to tell him, so when the American biggies left, SNSB went back to fooling around\nin his room during the meditation periods.\nConsider the perfect life of Gautama Buddha. To the last moment of his life he lived like a normal\n\nmonk. He was eighty years of age, yet he went forth and begged for his food every day\u2013no one brought\nspecially-prepared goodies for him. He lived outdoors, under a tree, not in a special \u201cretreat\u201d designed\nby a renowned architect-disciple. He dressed in the simple, minimal clothing of a monk, not in some\nexpensive rigs donated by disciples to express their \u201cdevotion.\u201d He walked everywhere he went. He did\nnot ride in some cart or chariot provided by a rich patron out of consideration for his age. And here is\nthe most important point of all: He meditated for hours a day, even withdrawing for weeks and months\nat a time to engage in even more intense meditation. He never relaxed his disciplines for an hour, much\nless a day. In this way he showed us how to not fall into delusion: keep on till the end, until the Self is\ntruly known. And then keep on until death says: The End.\n\nThe Sorrowless Self\n\u201cFormless is he, though inhabiting form. In the midst of the fleeting he abides forever. All-pervading\nand supreme is the Self. The wise man, knowing him in his true nature, transcends all grief.\nYama continues to instruct us regarding the nature of the Self, using the most simple words yet with the\nmost profound meanings.\nFormless is he, though inhabiting form\nAshariram sharireshu\u2013the bodiless within bodies\u2013such is the Self. Though ever without a \u201cbody\u201d or\nadjunct in any form (as far as its true nature is concerned), yet all bodies are inhabited by the Self.\nThere is no form in which the Self, the Formless, does not dwell. Who can number the forms in which\nwe have manifested from the beginning of our evolutionary peregrinations in relativity, yet we have\nslipped away from each embodiment as bodiless as we were from the first. Being one with Brahman, it\ncan be said of the Self as well as of Brahman:\nEverywhere are His hands, eyes, feet; His heads and His faces:\nThis whole world is His ear; He exists, encompassing all things;\nDoing the tasks of each sense, yet Himself devoid of the senses:\nStanding apart, He sustains: He is free from the gunas but feels them.\nHe is within and without: He lives in the live and the lifeless:\nSubtle beyond mind\u2019s grasp; so near us, so utterly distant:\nUndivided, He seems to divide into objects and creatures;\nSending creation forth from Himself, He upholds and withdraws it;\nLight of all lights, He abides beyond our ignorant darkness;\n>Knowledge, the one thing real we may study or know, the heart\u2019s dweller.\nIn the midst of the fleeting he abides forever\nAnavastheshv\u2019 avasthitam\u2013the stable among the unstable, the unchanging among the ever-changing\u2013so\nis the Self. For aeons we are entertained with the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of Maya\u2019s web. Finally we\nare no longer entertained by it, but wearied. Yet we find ourselves addicted to it. Only in the beginning\ndo addicts love their addiction. In time they come to loathe it, yet refuse to even hear of ridding\nthemselves of it. And then at last they see themselves as slaves, hating their bondage but incapable of\nshedding it. Yet we are ever free.\nPeople bound by various addictions, including alcohol and drugs, would come to Sri Ramakrishna and\nplead for help. Often he would just touch them, and their enslavement would be gone forever. Learning\nof this, we naturally glorify Sri Ramakrishna for his power of merciful deliverance, but we must not\noverlook the great truth it demonstrates: It was the nature of those people to be free. Otherwise he\n\ncould not have freed them.\nIf we would seek freedom, then, we must seek it only in the Self. And the Self being within, we must\nseek within. For \u201cWithout meditation, where is peace? Without peace, where is happiness?\u201d\nAll-pervading\nTime and space being mirages, the Self is everywhere. Infinity is not \u201cbigness\u201d so big it cannot be\ncalculated, it is beyond measuring because it transcends the modes of measurable being. It is simply\nanother mode of existence altogether. The truth is, the atman, like the Paramatman is omnipresent,\nomniscient, and omnipotent. (This latter is easy, since the Self never \u201cdoes\u201d anything.) So there is no\nplace where the Self is not present. It goes everywhere without moving.\nSupreme\nThe Self is supreme, but not in the sense of earthly entities. It is all-embracing. Not only is there\nnothing above it, there is nothing beneath it, for such states are not native\u2013and therefore impossible\u2013to\nit. But Maya is doing a superb job at convincing us otherwise and fooling us into thinking that the\npurpose of both material life and sadhana is to expand in the illusory realms of conditioned existence,\nto become large or small, to enter in or depart\u2013none of which are even possible for the Self.\nSimply hearing about the Self can make us more ignorant than we were before if we interpret the Self\nin terms of samsaric delusion.\nThe wise\nThe wise are those who know the Self as it is. And that they have accomplished by shedding their\nassociation with the unreal and turning back to their own reality.\nTranscend all grief\nThey transcend all grief by removing their center of awareness from the realm in which suffering is\npossible. Suffering being an illusion, they need only awaken from the dream and abide in the Real. This\nis not a negative state, for it is not just a removal of sorrow, but the entering into the bliss that is the\nnature of the Self.\n\nWho Can Know the Self?\nThe sense of nonsense\nI once read a long and rather tedious essay on Shakespeare\u2019s policy of putting discomfiting truths into\nthe mouths of fools so people could scorn them and not get upset with him for unmasking their folly. It\noften happens that what people hope is \u201cjust fun\u201d or \u201cnonsense\u201d is really insightful commentary on\ntheir foibles. The happens very often in poetry, for everybody knows we need not take poetry seriously.\nEdward Lear, who protected himself by first claiming that he wrote \u201cnonsense verse,\u201d made some\nprofound observations on life. Some of his limericks have a lot to say about how life should be lived.\nOne of his wisest works was a poem entitled \u201cThe Jumblies,\u201d in which he tells us at the end of every\nverse:\nFar and few, far and few,\nAre the lands where the Jumblies live;\n\nTheir heads are green, and their hands are blue,\nAnd they went to sea in a Sieve.\nThese exotic people, went to sea in a sieve. Everyone else said they would drown, considering that a\nsieve is more holes than anything else. Some even told them that though they might manage, it would\nbe a wrong thing to do. But they did it anyway\u2013excellently and to great profit. Upon their return, all the\nnay-sayers announced that they, too would go to sea in a sieve. But Lear assures us still that \u201cFar and\nfew, far and few, are the lands where the Jumblies live.\u201d No; everyone will not be going to sea in a\nsieve. Just the far and few Jumblies.\nThe requirements\nPerhaps Lear, as he wrote the poem, thought of the following from the Gospel of Saint Luke: \u201cThen\nsaid one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, Strive to enter in at the\nstrait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\u201d This is not a statement\nof pessimism, but of simple fact. All manage in time, but in dribbles.\nYama has been very encouraging in his exposition of the Self, but now having told of its wonder he\nenters upon the subject of what is required to know the Self. Actually, the \u201cprice\u201d he presents to us is\nquite simple and direct. If we are interested, then the price is substantial but not impossible. If we are\nonly window-shoppers, then the price seems unreasonable and beyond payment. Here it is in two\nverses:\n\u201cThe Self is not known through study of the scriptures, nor through subtlety of the intellect, nor\nthrough much learning; but by him who longs for him is he known.\u2019 Verily unto him does the Self\nreveal his true being.\u201d\n\u201cBy learning, a man cannot know him, if he desist not from evil, if he control not his senses, if he quiet\nnot his mind, and practice not meditation.\u201d\nNot through study of the scriptures\nI was fortunate some years back to live near an ideal Brahmin scholar, a professor of mathematics at a\nuniversity. Together we formed a Hindu Parishad to help Indian residents stay focused on Sanatana\nDharma while living in the West. At our first meeting several of us spoke. In his discourse, Sri Dwivedi\nspoke of the nature of true dharma as a way of life and not a system of abstract concepts. In contrast,\nthe other religions of the world are all \u201cpeople of The Book.\u201d Their entire identity is taken up with\nfollowing a Book and professing its teachings. As a consequence, he pointed out, they can all\n\u201cdialogue\u201d with even the Marxists, for they, too, are people of a Book. But what can they say to real\ndharma, which cannot be gotten out of a book? See how vast are the sacred writings of Sanatana\nDharma, yet we know that they are of limited value once true wisdom is gained.\nReading the Bhagavad Gita opened to me a world I had never thought could exist. How many\nwonderful things I found therein! Many were amazing, not the least being the statement: \u201cWhen the\nwhole country is flooded, the reservoir becomes superfluous. So, to the illumined seer, the Vedas are all\nsuperfluous.\u201d Here was a scripture that told me I should go beyond it and know for myself\u2013and showed\nme the way to do that! Sri Ramakrishna often used the simile of a letter. Once you read it and know\nwhat it says, what more need do you have for it?\nThe self cannot be known through scriptural study, for Krishna tells us that \u201che who even wishes to\nknow of yoga transcends the Vedic rites.\u201d Books are nothing more than paper and ink. Obsession with\n\nthem is detrimental, proving the truth of the statement that: \u201cthe letter kills, but the spirit gives life.\u201d We\nmust get behind the words of even illumined masters and tap the Source of those words.\nSri Ramakrishna frequently pointed out that almanacs predict rainfall, but you cannot get a drop by\nsqueezing them, however hard. In the same way, intense study of scriptures cannot give a drop of\nspiritual life, for no book can reveal That which lies beyond all we think or know.\nNot through subtlety of the intellect\nWe cannot possibly figure out the nature of anything, much less the Self, by mere intellection. This is\nnot the fault of the mind, any more than it is the fault of a blender that you cannot get television\nprograms through it. There is absolutely no faculty which can perceive or reveal the Self. The Self\nalone knows Itself. As long as we attempt to perceive the Self through any intermediary, just so long\nshall we be frustrated\u2013or worse, deluded. There is no instrument, however subtle, no capacity of the\nmind, however refined, that can reveal the Self. Yet, the purified intellect (buddhi) can intuit the\npresence of the Self and even some of its traits, and this is good, but this is not Self-knowledge. Many\nintelligent people with highly developed intellects mistake this intuition for direct experience and\nknowledge. This is a subtle trap we must avoid diligently. How could we know if we have fallen into\nthe trap rather than risen into the Light? That, actually is easy to determine. If we can talk about what\nwe perceive, and define it, then it is not the Self, but only our approximation. That which lies within the\nrange of speech lies outside the Self. No matter how near we can come to the Self, it is not the same as\nknowing the Self. For when the Self is revealed, all \u201cknowing\u201d not only ceases, it becomes impossible.\nIntelligence should not be confused with intellectuality. Intelligence is a help to the revelation of the\nSelf, but intellectuality is an insurmountable hindrance. That is why Jesus said to God: \u201cThou hast hid\nthese things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\u201d To demonstrate this\nvividly, \u201cJesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say\nunto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of\nheaven.\u201d Think how direct and uncomplicated a child\u2019s mind usually is. Also, they are capable of\nintensely magical/mystical thought. How unquestioning they accept the idea of the miraculous,\nincluding the power of the individual\u2013including themselves\u2013to work marvels. How sad that they ever\ncome to \u201cknow better\u201d in a wrong way. A friend of mine was watching a television program in which a\npianist seemed to be floating in the air and even turning over and over. \u201cHow do you suppose they do\nthat?\u201d she mused to herself aloud. Instantly her five-year-old said: \u201cEasy! There\u2019s a magician hidden in\nthe piano.\u201d And that is so true: there is a magical being hidden in each one of us known as the Self\nwhich can do\u2013and does\u2013all things.\nNot through much learning\nVyasa was the greatest sage of post-Vedic India, codifier of the Vedas, commentator on the Yoga Sutras,\nauthor of the Mahabharata (which includes the Bhagavad Gita), and the Brahma Sutras (Vedanta\nSutras). Vast as his writings were, hummed up everything that was taught by these holy books, saying:\nI shall tell you in half a verse (sloka) what has been written in tens of millions of books:\nBrahman is real. The world is unreal. The jiva [individual spirit] is none other than Brahman.\nThat is it. So when the future Swami Turiyananda told Sri Ramakrishna that he studied Vedanta for\nseveral hours a day, the great Master was astonished. Quoting the words of Vyasa, he asked: \u201cHow can\nyou spend hours studying something so simple? What more is there to say?\u201d Turiyananda got the idea\nbehind the idea and himself became a knower of the Self.\n\nAll the learning in the world is futile in relation to the Self and Brahman, for they lie outside the scope\nof the intellect. The ear cannot hear color, the eye cannot smell fragrance. No thing can know the Self\nbut the Self.\nIt can be done\nYama\u2019s words of seeming negation are really quite positive, for he then tells Nachiketa: \u201cBut by him\nwho longs for him is he known. Verily unto him does the Self reveal his true being.\u201d\nThis is a remarkable statement. There are no tools or gimmicks that can mechanically lead us to the\nvision of the Self. Certainly there are methods that aid in our search\u2013that is what yoga is all about. But\nit is a mistake to think that a technique can be applied like a crowbar to break open the inner treasury\nand loot the vault. (And this is the attitude of most \u201cseekers.\u201d) Methods, such as yoga (meditation),\nworship, and good deeds are necessary to successfully prosecute our quest for God. Their function is\ntwofold: they prepare us\u2013make us capable\u2013for the attainment of self-knowledge, and they are\nmanifestations\u2013evidence, actually\u2013of the genuineness of our aspiration. By engaging in them we live\nout our intention.\nMa Anandamayi continually assured people that the desire for the God was the way to God\u2013everything\nelse were aids or expressions, but it is our own divine self-will that accomplishes our liberation. This is\nvery important to understand.\nIt is commonly said that all religions are valid, that they all led to the same goal. That is true to some\ndegree, but it leaves out the real fact: it is the seeking that brings about the finding. Frankly, it is the\nseekers who validate the religions, not the other way around. People finding God in all religions is not a\nstatement about the worth of those religions, but a statement about the worth of those people. Sri\nRamakrishna attained God-vision through the various religions he practiced and thereby demonstrated\ntheir viability as spiritual paths. But he also revealed that it is the nature of the individual to attain that\nvision whatever the path that is followed. For without that innate capacity what value would the\nreligions have? The jivatman by its nature can know the Paramatman. As the Psalmist said: \u201cDeep\ncalleth unto deep.\u201d Like attracts like; it really does take one to know one.\nSwami Prabhavananda notes that an alternate translation can be: \u201cWhom the Self chooses, by him is he\nattained.\u201d In India they have the saying: \u201cHe who chooses God has first been chosen by Him.\u201d Jesus\ntold his disciples: \u201c Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.\u201d The very fact that we are seeking\nGod is guarantee of our finding, for it is an indication that He has called us. And He does not call in\nvain. Nor do we seek in vain. \u201cVerily unto him does the Self reveal his true being.\u201d\nYet there are obstacles to knowing the Self: \u201cBy learning, a man cannot know him, if he desist not from\nevil, if he control not his senses, if he quiet not his mind, and practice not meditation.\u201d\nLearning\nYama lists mere intellectual study, the heaping up of extraneous \u201cknowledge\u201d which by its character is\nexternal and superficial as an obstacle\u2013not so much in itself, but by the illusion of knowledge that\narises in the self-satisfied mind of the \u201cknower.\u201d Yama\u2019s assertion shows how mistaken it is to translate\nswadhyaya (self-study) as \u201cstudy of scriptures\u201d when we encounter it in the Yoga Sutras.\nThe Kena Upanishad examines this matter, saying: \u201cHe by whom Brahman is not known, knows It; he\nby whom It is known, knows It not. It is not known by those who know It; It is known by those who do\nnot know It.\u201d Obviously the word \u201cknow\u201d has two meanings here. One is the mere intellection about\n\nBrahman, the other is knowledge derived from the direct experience of Brahman, from conscious union\nwith Brahman. There is a knowing that is unknowing and an unknowing that is knowing. That is why\nSwami Prabhavananda renders the Kena verse: \u201cHe truly knows Brahman who knows him as beyond\nknowledge; he who thinks that he knows, knows not. The ignorant think that Brahman is known, but\nthe wise know him to be beyond knowledge.\u201d\nPersisting in evil\nEvil in all forms must be abandoned if the Self, which is all good, is to be known. This should not be\nhard to understand, but many deny it anyway, or try to skirt around it. Of them Jesus said: \u201cThey have\ntheir reward\u201d\u2013a false security that is really \u201cthe sleep of death.\u201d But for us who wish to live it is\nimportant to determine what is good and what is evil, what is right and what is wrong.\nSanatana Dharma has a concept of right and wrong unique among the world religions. The others teach\nthat something is right or wrong because their God or Prophet has said so in their infallible scriptures.\n\u201cIt is in the Bible,\u201d \u201cIt is in the ZendAvesta,\u201d \u201cIt is in the Koran,\u201d etc. Although the scriptures of Hindu\nDharma do mention things as being good or evil, the basis for the statements are utterly different from\nthat of other religions.\nSanatana Dharma does not look upon a thing as wrong because God or gods have declared it wrong or\nsome lawgiver has prohibited it. And the same in relation to the things that are right. Rather, a thing is\ngood or evil according to its innate character. Many times people tried to get Mata Anandamayi to\napprove or disapprove of something. But she would simply say: \u201cIf it takes you toward the Goal it is\ngood. If it takes you away from the Goal it is evil.\u201d That which darkens, obscures, or limits our\nconsciousness is bad. That which lights, clears, and expands our consciousness is good. That which\nhelps in the search for God is good; that which hinders or delays it is not.\nWe all know people who declare that their addictions and illusions either do not hurt them or even are\ngood for them. Very well; they have their reward. But the intelligent do not engage in such childish\nrationalization. They impartially examine and conclude accordingly. It is all a matter of the individual\u2019s\ninterest and honesty. In other words, it is all in our hands\u2013as are all the aspects of our life if we face up\nto it. Sanatana Dharma does not list \u201cbads\u201d and \u201cgoods\u201d because it assumes that those who wish to\npursue dharma can judge for themselves. Though we can certainly determine whether the Vedic\nscriptures consider something harmful or helpful, we should look upon the list as neither exhaustive or\neven binding. Sanatana Dharma is Manava Dharma\u2013human dharma. And human beings use their\nintelligent reason. Sanatana Dharma also leaves every one free to be wise or foolish. Dharma never\ncondemns or praises. It just waits to be fulfilled.\nLack of sense control\nThe senses must be controlled, but we usually mistake the way to do so. The upanishads use the simile\nof horses pulling a chariot, and we mistake that, too, thinking it a symbol of incredible forces to be\novercome. But we need not think of it so drastically. Before you control a horse, you tame it. So before\nwe control the senses we \u201ctame\u201d them through purification. Sadhana is the only way. Meditation alone\npurifies in a lasting manner. At the same time we purify the senses by directing them Godward. We\nmake the eyes look at sacred symbols or depictions, the ears to hear the words of sacred texts and\nsacred music, the nose to smell the offered incense, the tongue to taste the offered sweets or food, and\nthe inner sense of touch to feel the exalted atmosphere created by worship and contact with the holy.\nPilgrimage is valuable because it is a \u201ctotal sense\u201d experience of holiness. The good news is that we\nneed not struggle with the senses, but turn them in spiritual directions.\n\nRestlessness of mind\nRestlessness of mind is itself great suffering. Yama says that a quiet mind is indispensable to selfknowledge. Here is what Krishna has to say about it:\n\u201cIf a yogi has perfect control over his mind, and struggles continually in this way to unite himself with\nBrahman, he will come at last to the crowning peace of Nirvana, the peace that is in me.\u201d\n\u201cWhen can a man be said to have achieved union with Brahman? When his mind is under perfect\ncontrol and freed from all desires, so that he becomes absorbed in the Atman, and nothing else. \u201cThe\nlight of a lamp does not flicker in a windless place\u201d: that is the simile which describes a yogi of onepointed mind, who meditates upon the Atman. When, through the practice of yoga, the mind ceases its\nrestless movements, and becomes still, he realizes the Atman. It satisfies him entirely. Then he knows\nthat infinite happiness which can be realized by the purified heart but is beyond the grasp of the senses.\nHe stands firm in this realization. Because of it, he can never again wander from the inmost truth of his\nbeing.\u201d\nCan I say more than that?\nWithout meditation\n\u201cWithout meditation, where is peace? Without peace, where is happiness?\u201d\nThe sine qua non of self-knowledge is meditation. The Self is ever-present but we do not perceive it\nbecause our vision is obscured by the illusion known as Maya. After describing the method of\nmeditation, Krishna says: \u201cIf he practices meditation in this manner, his heart will become pure\u201d and\nthe Self will become literally self-evident. In conclusion he remarks: \u201cMake a habit of practicing\nmeditation, and do not let your mind be distracted. In this way you will come finally to the Lord, who\nis the light-giver, the highest of the high.\u201d\nThe formula\nThe Self can be known by those who truly desire to know. And that true desire manifests through\ndesisting from evil, controlling of the senses, quieting (restraining) the mind, and practicing meditation.\nThis is the real Formula For Success.\n\nThe All-Consuming Self\nSomewhere along the line\u2013perhaps when they stopped killing their own people for sacrificial victims\nand committing genocide for the glory of their gods\u2013the religion of Westerners lost its vigor.\n\u201cSpiritual\u201d came to be equated with the insubstantial and ethereal, degenerating in time into an airy and\nvaporous sentimentalism of the sickliest character. Languishing in love for God became an ideal along\nwith nobly bearing the terrible burdens God threw onto a groaning and groveling humanity. The\nkeynote of all this was passivity, and not a passivity born of true courage or nobility, but from a\ncrushing sense of impotence and hopelessness. Hell became exalted to heaven, and the contempt of a\ncapricious and tyrannical God became Divine Love, a love that demanded placation and acceptanceobedience. This God of love hated a lot more things than he liked and basically tolerated nothing. His\nreligion in time became just like him, and so did many of his devotees\u2013in attitude and deed. Since he\nwas the ideal Father, they began treating their children just as he did his. Contemporary Western society\nis the result. Even the rebellion against this madness is as hateful, ignorant, and repressive as that which\nis being supposedly rejected. Only the pious cover is discarded; the evil core flourishes. The utter\n\ninsubstantiality of the \u201cspirituel\u201d has become a logical doorway to denial of any spiritual reality.\nIn the East (India) things are fundamentally different, even if some of the sillier ways of Western\nreligion are also to be found there, particularly in the \u201cbhakti movement.\u201d The concept of the Self as\nidentified with the Supreme Self rather than a creation whose tenuous existence is continually\nthreatened by the possibility of divine wrath, has produced a psychology and a society the reverse of\nthat found in the West. The Self is as eternal and immovable as God\u2013because it is one with God.\nAlways.\nIn the nineteenth century the remarkable poet, author, and mystic Emily Bronte became exposed to the\nUpanishads and the Bhagavad Gita while studying in Belgium. She had long before instinctually\nrejected the ignorant religion of her childhood, but now she had an intelligent basis for her rejection.\nFortunately it took the form of affirmation rather than negation. She had seen clearly when nine or so\nthat she and all her sisters (and brother) would die young of the same disease (tuberculosis), and had\nwritten a poem about it. When death was only a matter of weeks away, she wrote this final poem:\nNo coward soul is mine,\nNo trembler in the world\u2019s storm-troubled sphere:\nI see Heaven\u2019s glories shine,\nAnd Faith shines equal, arming me from Fear.\nO God within my breast,\nAlmighty, ever-present Deity!\nLife, that in me has rest,\nAs I, undying Life, have power in Thee!\nVain are the thousand creeds\nThat move men\u2019s hearts: unutterably vain;\nWorthless as withered weeds,\nOr idlest froth amid the boundless main,\nTo waken doubt in one\nHolding so fast by Thy infinity,\nSo surely anchored on\nThe steadfast rock of Immortality.\nWith wide-embracing love\nThy Spirit animates eternal years,\nPervades and broods above,\nChanges, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears.\nThough earth and moon were gone,\nAnd suns and universes ceased to be,\nAnd Thou wert left alone,\nEvery existence would exist in Thee.\nThere is not room for Death,\nNor atom that his might could render void:\nThou\u2013thou art Being and Breath,\nAnd what thou art may never be destroyed.\n\nYama\u2019s analysis of the Self has had a very logical progression. Then he tosses out to Nachiketa a single\nincredible sentence: \u201cTo him Brahmins and Kshatriyas are but food, and death itself a condiment.\u201d\nAll that we consider worthy of respect, either venerable (brahmin) or powerful (kshatriya), is but a\nsnack to the everlasting Self. Even death, which is ever with us and seemingly rules our destiny, is but a\nflavoring for the Self at its feast of life, adding spice.\nYama\u2019s words are reminiscent of Arjuna\u2019s vision of the Universal Self in the eleventh chapter of the\nBhagavad Gita. Since the individual atman and the Paramatman are one they have the same qualities.\nJust as Arjuna saw that all things emanate from the Supreme and are reabsorbed in the Supreme\u2013are\n\u201ceaten\u201d by It, so it is with the Self. All that is \u201cus\u201d has come from the Self and shall return to the Self.\nThe Self is the eternal immortal source of that which we think is temporal and perishable. But only the\nforms are such. Their essence is the Self.\nUnborn, the Self moves through many births. Formless, the Self inhabits many forms. Untouched, the\nSelf encounters a myriad objects. Unconditioned, the Self manifests countless qualities. Remaining\nwhat it is, the Self appears to be all that it is not. All that it encounters is but its repast, and its births and\ndeaths merely a sauce.\n\u201cLicking with your burning tongues, devouring all the worlds, you probe the heights of heaven!\u201d\n\nThe Divine Indwellers\n\u201cBoth the individual self and the Universal Self have entered the cave of the heart, the abode of the\nMost High, but the knowers of Brahman and the householders who perform the fire sacrifices see a\ndifference between them as between sunshine and shadow.\u201d\nThe two selves\nThere are two selves\u2013the many individual selves and the one Universal Self. The Mundaka Upanishad\nlikens them to two birds of the same appearance who sit in the same tree. First we come to know the\nindividual self, and that enables us to attain the knowledge of the All-inclusive Self. How the two exist\nas one yet two is incomprehensible to the intellect but is readily experienced by the inmost\nconsciousness of the persevering yogi. Yet intellectually we need to have some grasp of the\nunity/duality, otherwise we can have no correct perspective on anything, inner or outer. Extreme\ndualism is an error, and \u201cmonism\u201d of any kind is even worse in its \u201csimplisticism.\u201d For this reason the\nenlightened use the expression Non-Dual (advaita) as the nearest we can come to conveying the truth of\nour existence. The verse beginning Purnamadah purnamidam is usually interpreted as a statement that\nthe Relative has come from the Transcendent while retaining essential unity with the Transcendent. But\nit can also be understood as referring to the individual Self that exists rooted in the Universal Self. It,\nthe atman, originates in the Supreme Self, the Paramatman, and is never separate from that Self. If\nexamined, the two will be seen to be one. How is it possible? The One alone knows\u2013and those who\nhave united their consciousness with the One through yoga.\nThe cave of the heart\nIt is easy to see that the individual Self abides in\u2013and as\u2013the heart (hridaya), but when we look at the\nvast manifestation of Cosmic Life we call \u201ccreation\u201d it is natural for our awareness to be drawn\noutward and thereby forget that the Supreme Self is right there inside in the same space (akasha). The\nParamatman is not in the cave of our heart only incidentally, since It is everywhere, but that is Its\nabode, its \u201cnative place,\u201d Its center. Its manifestation can be found everywhere, but It can be found\n\nonly in the cave of the heart.\nOnly that yogi\nWhose joy is inward,\nInward his peace,\nAnd his vision inward\nShall come to Brahman\nAnd know Nirvana.\nGreat is that yogi who seeks to be with Brahman,\nGreater than those who mortify the body,\nGreater than the learned,\nGreater than the doers of good works:\nTherefore, Arjuna, become a yogi.\nHow foolish to climb mountains, delve into the earth, wander across the plains, or cross the seas,\nthinking to find the Abode of God\u2013which is the heart alone.\nThe two knowers\nThere are those who know Brahman directly and those who possess a secondary knowledge based on\nintuition resulting from their seeking of Brahman. Though only the first really know Brahman, yet the\nothers\u2019 \u201cknowing about\u201d Brahman is of such a character that it can lead them on to the direct\nknowledge of the illumined. Both of these have the same understanding without contradiction.\nTherefore the Finders never disdain the Seekers.\nThe difference\nWhat do the Finders and Seekers know? That the atman and the Paramatman, though one, are as\ndifferent as sunshine and shadow. But not in the sense of being opposite or antithetical to one another.\nRather, it means that the individual Self exists only because the Supreme Self exists, just as a shadow\ncan only exist because of the light. As the Rig Veda says of the Supreme Self: \u201cHis shadow is\nimmortality.\u201d Also, the idea is that the individual self (jivatman) is a reflection of the Supreme Self\n(Paramatman). Later, Yama will say: \u201cHe shining, everything shines.\u201d\nThe aspiration\nSince the foregoing is true, the next verse of the upanishad says: \u201cMay we perform the Nachiketa\nSacrifice, which bridges the world of suffering. May we know the imperishable Brahman, who is\nfearless, and who is the end and refuge of those who seek liberation.\u201d\nWhat is the Nachiketa Sacrifice? It is not a secret fire ritual that produces a magical enlightenment. The\nNachiketa Sacrifice is the determined search for knowledge (jnana) which stops not until the Goal is\nreached. That is this the correct understanding is demonstrated by the results desired by the sacrificer:\nthe knowledge of Brahman.\nThe search for union with God is the bridge which we cross to be free from this world of suffering.\nSeeking God is itself the guarantee that we shall find Him. Many who lack confidence worry as to\nwhether they can succeed in spiritual life, if they are \u201cready,\u201d and so forth. But the very fact that they\nwish to find God means that they have already travelled far along the path in previous lives. Otherwise\nthey would sleep along with most of the world. \u201cFor the man who has once asked the way to Brahman\ngoes further than any mere fulfiller of the Vedic rituals.\u201d \u201cThe scriptures declare that merit can be\n\nacquired by studying the Vedas, performing ritualistic sacrifices, practising austerities and giving alms.\nBut the yogi who has understood this teaching of mine will gain more than any who do these things. He\nwill reach that universal source, which is the uttermost abode of God.\u201d\nTruly, \u201cMay we know the imperishable Brahman, who is fearless, and who is the end and refuge of\nthose who seek liberation.\u201d\n\nThe Chariot\nPerhaps the most perfect simile of our condition as human beings as we meander through the labyrinth\nof continual birth and death is that given in the Katha Upanishad, and it is worthy of careful analysis.\n\u201cKnow that the Self is the rider, and the body the chariot; that the intellect is the charioteer, and the\nmind the reins.\u201d The first idea set forth in this verse is the completely inactive role of the individual\nSelf (atman). The other \u201cingredients\u201d in the list are actively involved in \u201cliving\u201d but the atman is\nabsolutely beyond any activity, and is merely the observer. This is because its nature is pure\nconsciousness\u2013and nothing else.\nBody-chariot\nThe body is the chariot, a conglomerate of parts without any consciousness or will of its own. (Did\nanyone else \u201cout there\u201d grow up hearing certain fundamentalists say: \u201cI don\u2019t sin but my body sins\u201d?)\nYet, being pervaded by the intellect (buddhi) it does seem to have \u201ca mind of its own.\u201d It does not, but\nit is an extension-expression of the mind and as such has great relevance to the spiritual aspirant. Sri\nRamakrishna used to study the physical configuration of newcomers and thereby determine their\nspiritual qualifications. So we must think of the body as an inert thing. It is alive, but alive through the\nindwelling spirit. We may not be the body, but the body is certainly an expression of ourself. The body\nis not only the vehicle of our accumulated karmas it is the embodiment of them. Our karmas are\nincarnated in the body much more than is the Self.\nIntellect-charioteer\n\u201cThe intellect is the charioteer.\u201d Our movement through \u201clife\u201d is solely through the agency of the\nintellect, the buddhi. This is why Krishna speaks of Buddhi Yoga as the process of liberation. Yoga is\nsolely under the supervision of the buddhi. Yoga takes place both through the buddhi and within the\nbuddhi. This gives us a tremendous insight into the nature of liberation: it is totally a matter of intellect,\nof reconstruction of awareness. The wise certainly undertake many external, even physical, disciplines\nto assist in their practice of yoga, but all of these are intended to affect the buddhi in its striving\ntowards enlightenment. Since the buddhi is the charioteer, its quality determines everything in life. The\ncultivation of our buddhi, then, must be the focus of our sadhana. Any humanimal can be taught asanas\nand pranayama, but only the developed human can engage in real yoga. If you think this previous\nstatement is extreme let me tell you something I learned early on in my \u201cyoga life.\u201d\nIn 1962 I was privileged to meet and listen to the venerable A. B. Purani, the administrator of the\nrenowned Aurobindo Ashram. Sri Purani had been a fellow revolutionary with the (future) great Master\nSri Aurobindo Ghosh (who, incidentally, was a high school teacher and inspirer of Paramhansa\nYogananda). Later he became his disciple and lived in the ashram for many years before the master\u2019s\npassing.\nDuring one of his brilliant discourses at the East-West Cultural Center in Hollywood, Sri Purani told of\nan experience he had while travelling to the United States. He had stopped over in Japan where he was\n\ninvited to speak to a yoga group in Tokyo. This group taught and practiced only Hatha Yoga (asanas\nand pranayama). At the conclusion of his talk, Sri Purani asked them: \u201cWould you agree that the\ngreatest yogis of recent times were Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Aurobindo, and Sri Ramana Maharshi?\u201d They\nexpressed unanimous assent to this statement. \u201cYet,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cnot one of them practiced Hatha\nYoga. So why do you consider yourselves yogis when you only practice that which they never bothered\nwith?\u201d\nNo matter how many external assists we may use, yoga is essentially of the buddhi alone.\nMind-reins\n\u201cAnd the mind the reins.\u201d By mind (manah) is meant the sensory mind, the intermediary between the\nintellect and the body\u2013and the entire world, as well. Through the mind the intellect sees whether the\nbody should act or be still. For example, the mind conveys the sensation of a hand burning to the\nintellect, which then directs the body\u2013again, through the mind\u2013to pull the hand away from the fire and\nplunge it in cold water or some such remedy.\nThe next element in the matter are the senses, without which the mind would have nothing to show the\nintellect. Therefore:\nSense-horses\n\u201cThe senses, say the wise, are the horses; the roads they travel are the mazes of desire.\u201d\nIt is the senses that drag the chariot of the body along according to their impulses. If the buddhi is weak\nor underdeveloped, the mind which is driven by pain-pleasure motivation alone takes complete charge\nin giving \u201cfull rein\u201d to the senses. Having no intelligence they plunge onward, ever seeking fulfillment\nand, not finding it, hurtling even further on the paths of unreason and folly. For \u201cthe roads they travel\nare the mazes of desire\u201d rather than intelligence. As a consequence the individual becomes hopelessly\nlost and mired in the morass of external sensation. Enslavement to body and senses is the only possible\nconsequence\u2013death in life and ultimately death in \u201cactuality\u201d\u2013of the body and senses.\nSelf-definition\n\u201cWho am I?\u201d is the gate to real understanding, for it sets us seeking true knowledge. And the\nupanishadic verse continues: \u201cThe wise call the Self the enjoyer when he is united with the body, the\nsenses, and the mind.\u201d We certainly do not enjoy a great deal of our experiences in/through the body, so\nperhaps a better translation of bhokta is \u201cexperiencer\u201d rather than enjoyer.\nThe major idea in this verse is that the Self is the actionless consciousness that experiences the intellect,\nmind, senses, and body. As a consequence we can understand that the Self is never \u201cthe doer\u201d at any\ntime. The Gita illumines this for us, saying: \u201cEvery action is really performed by the gunas [sensory\nenergies]. Man, deluded by his egoism, thinks: \u2018I am the doer.\u2019 But he who has the true insight into the\noperations of the gunas and their various functions, knows that when senses attach themselves to\nobjects, gunas are merely attaching themselves to gunas. Knowing this, he does not become attached to\nhis actions.\u201d \u201cYou dream you are the doer.\u201d \u201cLet the wise man know these gunas alone as the doers of\nevery action; let him learn to know That Which is beyond them, also.\u201d\nThere is more material like this, but the sum is: \u201cThe truly admirable man controls his senses by the\npower of his will.\u201d This is because: \u201cThe senses are said to be higher than the sense-objects. The mind\nis higher than the senses. The intelligent will is higher than the mind. What is higher than the intelligent\nwill? The Atman Itself.\u201d\n\nThe practical application\n\u201cWhen a man lacks discrimination and his mind is uncontrolled, his senses are unmanageable, like the\nrestive horses of a charioteer. But when a man has discrimination and his mind is controlled, his senses,\nlike the well-broken horses of a charioteer, lightly obey the rein.\u201d\nAnd more:\n\u201cHe who lacks discrimination, whose mind is unsteady and whose heart is impure, never reaches the\ngoal, but is born again and again. But he who has discrimination, whose mind is steady and whose\nheart is pure, reaches the goal, and having reached it is born no more. The man who has a sound\nunderstanding for charioteer, a controlled mind for reins\u2013he it is that reaches the end of the journey, the\nsupreme abode of Vishnu, the all pervading.\u201d\n\nThe Chariot\u2019s Journey\nThe upanishadic seers have just told us that the Self in the body is like a driver in a chariot. Now they\nset the intended journey before us.\n\u201cThe senses derive from physical objects, physical objects from mind, mind from intellect, intellect\nfrom ego, ego from the unmanifested seed, and the unmanifested seed from Brahman\u2013the Uncaused\nCause. Brahman is the end of the journey. Brahman is the supreme goal.\u201d\nIt is the genealogy of perception that is being outlined here, for if we reverse the order of perception we\nwill come to perceive the Source, the Eternal Witness Itself. This verse, then, is a exposition of the\nchain, or progression of consciousness. According to it, the hierarchy of perception is:\nBrahman (Purusha)\nUnmanifested seed (Avyaktam)\nEgo (Atma Mahan\u2013the Great Self or Mahat Tattwa)\nIntellect (Buddhi)\nMind (Manas)\nSenses (Indriyas)\nPhysical objects (Arthas)\nThe Bhagavad Gita gives a similar but simpler list relating exclusively to the individual (microcosm)\nrather than the Universal (Macrocosm), but we can translate the foregoing list to relate to us as\nindividual beings (jivas). In that case we get:\nThe Self\nThe unmanifested yet out-turned will-energy\nThe sense of \u201cI am\u201d\nThe intellect\nThe mind\nThe senses\nThe sense organs.\nMy list is more literal than that of Swami Prabhavananda. It is not more meritorious when considering\nthe Cosmos, but it is better when looking at the situation of the individual being.\nHaving descended the ladder, how do we get back up\u2013especially sense we have no memory of how we\n\nmanaged the descent? Luckily for us the yogis of India figured that out for us untold eons ago, and it\nworks as well today as it did then. Meditation is the way of ascent back to awareness of the Self. It is\npossible to work our way back up the ladder, for the \u201crungs\u201d are not disparate elements but evolutes or\nemanations of those above them. If all the rungs, including the senses themselves, were not extensions\nof the Self, we could not reach back to the Self. This is as true on the microcosmic level as it is on the\nmacrocosmic. Fortunately Brahman has not \u201cfallen\u201d and forgotten Itself, but It, too, withdraws and\nprojects himself as creation\u2013as we do ourselves by coming into manifestation and eventually into\nphysical birth. \u201cAs above, so below\u201d has many ramifications.\nThe destination and how to get there\n\u201cBrahman is the end of the journey. Brahman is the supreme goal.\u201d But the simple saying counts for\nlittle. So the upanishad continues: \u201cThis Brahman, this Self, deep-hidden in all beings, is not revealed\nto all; but to the seers, pure in heart, concentrated in mind\u2013to them is he revealed.\u201d Who sees Brahman?\nThe sukshma-darshibhih\u2013those who can see the subtle, the inmost Reality.\nHow, then, can we become seers of the Subtle? By continually developing our capacity for inner\nperception and simultaneously refining our inner faculties. To do that we must \u201cgo inside\u201d in\nmeditation and work with our inner mechanism called the antahkarana by the yogis. As the Taittiriya\nUpanishad says: \u201cSeek to know Brahman by meditation.\u201d And: \u201cOm is Brahman. Om is all. He who\nmeditates on Om attains to Brahman.\u201d\n\u201cWithin the lotus of the heart he dwells, where, like the spokes of a wheel in its hub, the nerves meet.\nMeditate on him as OM. Easily mayest thou cross the sea of darkness.\u201d\n\u201cThe mind may be compared to a firestick, the syllable OM to another. Rub the two sticks together by\nrepeating the sacred syllable and meditating on Brahman, and the flame of knowledge will be kindled\nin your heart and all impurities will be burnt away.\u201d \u201cLet your body be the stick that is rubbed, the\nsacred syllable OM the stick that is rubbed against it. Thus shall you realize God, who is hidden within\nthe body as fire is hidden within the wood.\u201d\nTurning back\n\u201cThe senses of the wise man obey his mind, his mind obeys his intellect, his intellect obeys his ego, and\nhis ego obeys the Self.\u201d This, too, is the product/effect of meditation! Meditation is the establishing of\norder within and without.\nMarching orders!\n\u201cArise! Awake! Approach the feet of the master and know THAT.\u201d\nIn point of fact, the text does not say \u201capproach the feet of the master,\u201d but prapya varan, which means\n\u201chaving attained boons.\u201d The idea is to seek and attain kripa\u2013grace. Actually, the scriptures speak of\nthree kinds of kripa: 1) sadhana kripa, the grace of self-effort; ) guru kripa, the grace of a teacher, and\n3) divya kripa, divine grace. This wise will gain all three. But there is no denying that kripa is a\nrequisite for those who, having arisen and awakened, seek Brahman.\nThe path\nThe verse continues: \u201cLike the sharp edge of a razor, the sages say, is the path. Narrow it is, and\ndifficult to tread!\u201d Immediately we think of Jesus words: \u201cEnter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the\ngate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because\n\nstrait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\u201d\nBecause popular religion, despite its attempt to entice followers, continually implies or outright states\nthat spiritual life is hard (I grew up with this in fundamentalist Protestantism and found it outrageous),\nwe tend to look at the principles of Sanatana Dharma with a tainted perspective. The upanishad is not\ntelling us in the manner of Western religion how hard it will be to follow the way of life.\nThe clue to difficulty in spiritual is found in the description of the path as \u201clike the sharp edge of a\nrazor.\u201d The idea is that the path is extremely subtle\u2013not arduous. But that makes it all the more difficult,\neven impossible, for those of coarse minds. This, and this alone, is what makes the path hard to tread.\nNo spiritual discipline comes near to being as hard as the things human beings commonly do every day\nto get the things they want. And \u201cwant\u201d is the operative word. If we do not want a thing, then any\naction needed to obtain it will be tedious and \u201ctoo hard.\u201d But if we want it intensely, then no effort is\ntoo much or too hard. That is why the thirty-fourth Ode of Solomon says: \u201cThere is no hard way where\nthere is a simple heart, nor any barrier where the thoughts are upright. Nor is there any whirlwind in the\ndepth of the illuminated thought. Where one is surrounded on every side by pleasing country, there is\nnothing divided in him.\u201d So the problem is in us, not in the path.\nHere, as in the last essay, we see that the solution is to refine our consciousness through meditation. We\nmust also refine our physical and mental bodes through purity of thought and deed and especially\npurity of diet. The ingesting of animal flesh, alcohol, nicotine and mind-affecting drugs is a frontal\nattack on spiritual life. It is completely insane for a seeker to engage in such destructive habits (and\nthey are addictions).\nThe subtle Goal\nThe absolute necessity for refinement of perception through refinement of all the levels of our being is\nrevealed by the nature of the path\u2019s goal: \u201cSoundless, formless, intangible, undying, tasteless, odorless,\nwithout beginning, without end, eternal, immutable, beyond nature, is the Self. Knowing him as such,\none is freed from death.\u201d\nWe must become able to hear Silence, see the Formless, touch the Untouchable, live to the Immortal,\ntaste the Tasteless, perceive the fragrance of the Odorless, and transcend all relative measure, and even\nrelativity itself. Such a state is verily inconceivable to us at the present. But it can be achieved through\nyoga.\nLet us arise, awake, pass from death unto life, and lay hold of Immortality.\n\nThe Glorious Way\nThe Katha Upanishad is now going to elaborate on the path so we can better understand how to journey\nupon it.\n\u201cThe Self-Existent made the senses turn outward. Accordingly, man looks toward what is without, and\nsees not what is within. Rare is he who, longing for immortality, shuts his eyes to what is without and\nbeholds the Self.\u201d\nWhy?\nThe first thing this verse teaches us is that the Divine Itself has caused our consciousness to turn\noutward. This is not the result of any negative force or \u201cfall\u201d on our part. (The fall took place as a\n\nwrong response to the outward turn.) What was the purpose of our turning outward? Evolution. We had\nto enter into relative existence and run the maze of ever-ascending evolution in order to satisfy our\ninnate urge for infinity. (For more on this, see .) Consequently, there is nothing wrong with the senses\nturning outward; the problem is when the sense become locked in externalizing. The purpose of our\nentering the field of evolutionary life was for us to experience the many shades of evolving\nconsciousness while never losing awareness of our true nature or identifying with the costumes we\nconstantly donned and put off as the ages progressed. However it may have been intended, the situation\nhas horribly changed, making us blind to inner realities.\nSunk in awareness of seeming mortality, human beings either seek to distract themselves from the\nterror and pain which arises from their delusion, or they seek some way to attain immortality. Both\nsearches are based on delusion, so they can only fail. We need not become immortal, but must realize\nour present, eternal immortal nature. Those who shut their eyes\u2013their consciousness\u2013to the false\nappearances of external existence and turn within discover the truth of their immortality. No longer do\nthey think that the solution is to be found in some external factor, but clearly see that their own Self is\nthe wondrous answer.\nThe foolish and the wise\n\u201cFools follow the desires of the flesh and fall into the snare of all-encompassing death; but the wise,\nknowing the Self as eternal, seek not the things that pass away.\u201d\nIn its true state, relative existence is a vast field of life, but when it is overlain with the veneer of our\ninner delusions, it becomes death to us. That which is meant to expand our consciousness and free us\ninto Infinity becomes a prison, a killer of our soul\u2013and this is all our doing. The world remains what it\never was, but we have lost sight of its nature just as we have become blind to our own Self.\nThe urge to expansion of consciousness through upward-moving evolution becomes distorted into a\nmyriad desires arising from our false identity with the body and its illusory mortality. \u201cSeize the\nmoment!\u201d is our despairing cry. Seeking to live, we plunge ourselves \u201cinto the snare of allencompassing death.\u201d\nThe wise, who have come to know their immortality through the direct experience produced (only) by\nmeditation, turn from the snare and seek only that which cannot pass away because it has never come\ninto being at some point in time, but is immortal\u2013like us. In other words, we seek the kingdom of God\nthat is nothing less than God\u2013and our own Self.\nThere is a seeking that is necessary, but a seeking for deepening consciousness rather than for\nsomething that is not already ours. We must not fall into the facile illusion that we have nothing to do\nor attain. Certainly there is nothing objective to be done or attained, but in the subjective realm of\nConsciousness there is literally Everything to be sought and attained. \u201cStrive without ceasing to know\nthe Atman, seek this knowledge and comprehend clearly why you should seek it: such, it is said, are the\nroots of true wisdom.\u201d\n\nTo Know The Self\nDefining the Self\nRecently I read of a yogi who was asked, \u201cWhat is the Self?\u201d The yogi answered: \u201cThe one who knows\nthe mind.\u201d How simple! And the answer to the query, \u201cWho/What is God?\u201d is equally simple: The one\nwho enables the Self to know the mind and Who knows the Self as its Self.\n\n\u201cHe through whom man sees, tastes, smells, hears, feels, and enjoys, is the omniscient Lord.\u201d All the\ndoors of perception function through the Divine Presence, not just the Divine Power. Our\nconsciousness is the Consciousness of God, the finite drawn from the Infinite, as the wave draws its\nexistence from the ocean. It is a grave error to decry the experience of our senses as either illusory or\nsomehow degrading. It is our response to sensory experience that is often illusory or degrading. But we\nare at every moment living in and by God.\nBut God is not just the Power by which \u201cwe live, and move, and have our being.\u201d \u201cHe, verily, is the\nimmortal Self. Knowing him, one knows all things.\u201d He is the all-embracing Consciousness within our\nconsciousness and within all things. If we come to know\u2013enter into the being of\u2013that Infinite One we\nshall know with His knowing, and therefore know all things. As Saint Paul said: \u201cNow I know in part;\nbut then shall I know even as also I am known.\u201d This is the inmost meaning of Saint John\u2019s statement:\n\u201cBeloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,\nwhen he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.\u201d\n\u201cHe through whom man experiences the sleeping or waking states is the all-pervading Self. Knowing\nhim, one grieves no more.\u201d All states of consciousness are directly rooted in the Self, individual and\nuniversal. When through yoga this is truly known, all grief ceases, for the yogi identifies with his allperceiving Self.\nHe transcends fear as well, for \u201cHe who knows that the individual soul, enjoyer of the fruits of action,\nis the Self\u2013ever present within, lord of time, past and future\u2013casts out all fear. For this Self is the\nimmortal Self.\u201d What an incredible statement! We are thinking that we are poor, mortal beings swept\nalong by forces alien to us and totally beyond our control, when all the time we are the masters of past\nand future. All our fear comes from our unawareness of this glorious fact. By turning inward and\ndiscovering the truth of ourself we will pass beyond fear. The message of the upanishads is inseparably\nbound up with the necessity for sadhana if it is not to be no more than dead words on a dead page.\nSeeing truly\n\u201cHe who sees the First-Born\u2014born of the mind of Brahma, born before the creation of waters\u2013and sees\nhim inhabiting the lotus of the heart, living among physical elements, sees Brahman indeed. For this\nFirst-Born is the immortal Self.\u201d The only way to \u201csee true\u201d is to see The True.\nWhen we turn within, to the core of our being, there we will not only find the individual self, the jiva or\natman, but we will find its origin, the Supreme Self, the Paramatman, the eternal Brahman. This is the\ntrue vision of God\u2013that in which the two are seen to be One, although their distinction is eternal. The\nword \u201cborn\u201d is misleading, for the Self is never born. There does come a time when it becomes\nmanifest in relative creation, but it existed before that \u201cbirth.\u201d It is not even right to say that God is our\n\u201corigin,\u201d for the Self is co-eternal with God. As Krishna told Arjuna: \u201cThere was never a time when I\ndid not exist, nor you, nor any of these kings. Nor is there any future in which we shall cease to be.\u201d\nThe all-embracing Self\nIt is no news to us that God not only is within all things but in an ineffable way IS all things. But there\nis a further fact: We, too, embrace all the levels of being on the finite level, just as does God on the\ninfinite level. So the upanishads further says: \u201cThat being who is the power of all powers, and is born\nas such, who embodies himself in the elements and in them exists, and who has entered the lotus of the\nheart, is the immortal Self.\u201d Again, this refers to both the finite and the Infinite spirits.\nTherefore we see that in the vision of the upanishadic sages we are not abstract spirits with no\n\nconnection whatever with the energies of prakriti. Rather, as with God, those energies are our own\nexpanded and \u201cfrozen\u201d energies that in time are to be revealed as consciousness and assimilated into\nour Self\u2013from which they have never really been separate. Everything is consciousness. In the final\nsense there is no matter or energy at all. Yet, at the moment we find ourselves in the seemingly\nmanifold condition that is necessary for our evolution and ultimate freedom.\nWe not only mistake our own nature, we mistake the nature of God as well. We are ourselves \u201cthe\npower of all powers,\u201d having willingly embodied ourselves in subtle and gross matter while still living\nessentially in \u201cthe lotus of the heart.\u201d How then can we consider ourselves the servants or slaves of any\nbeing\u2013including God? There is no \u201cwork of God\u201d in this world for us to do\u2013only our work, the\nascension to perfect freedom. There is a theism that is bondage and a theism that is freedom. We must\ndiscriminate between the two.\nThe source\nBecause it fits better with the foregoing, let us skip a verse and read: \u201cThat in which the sun rises and in\nwhich it sets, that which is the source of all the powers of nature and of the senses, that which nothing\ncan transcend\u2013that is the immortal Self.\u201d\nThe Self and the Supreme Self are both the Chidakasha, the Sky or Ether of Consciousness in which\nthe sun of manifested life rises and sets. The waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states take place within\nthe consciousness that is the Self. The experience of birth and death likewise take place within the Self.\nThe Self is, like the Supreme Self, the source of the energies that manifest as the various levels of the\nsubtle and gross bodies which we are presently evolving until they manifest as the spirit-self. Nothing\nis ever destroyed, but is resolved back into its origin, the spirit. This is the great and awesome assertion\nof the upanishads.\nNothing is beyond or higher than the Self\u2013not even God, for God and the Self are essentially one, as\nare the ocean and the waves. As long as we dream of separation, so long will we continue to come and\ngo, suffering the pain and fear of continual change. But when we awaken into Unity, all sorrow and fear\ncease forever.\n\nThe Power of Enlightenment\n\u201cAgni, the all-seeing, who lies hidden in fire sticks, like a child well guarded in the womb, who is\nworshiped day by day by awakened souls, and by those who offer oblations in sacrificial fire\u2013he is the\nimmortal Self.\u201d\nAccording to the researches of Sri Aurobindo, Agni, the supposed \u201cgod of fire,\u201d is really the will power\nof the individual which manifests specifically in the practice of yoga. This is not the whimsical will\npower of egoic goals, but the will to liberate our consciousness from all bonds. This manifests\nexclusively in spiritual practice, not in philosophizing or in feeling \u201cspiritual.\u201d This is the highest form\nof action possible to any being in relativity, and merits our careful analysis.\nHidden in fire sticks\nThe fire for the Vedic sacrifice is kindled by the friction of two sticks. The upanishad uses this as a\nsimile, saying that the yogic fire \u201clies hidden in fire sticks.\u201d Both the Kaivalya and the Swetashwatara\nUpanishads explain this as follows.\n\n\u201cThe mind may be compared to a firestick, the syllable OM to another. Rub the two sticks together by\nrepeating the sacred syllable and meditating on Brahman, and the flame of knowledge will be kindled\nin your heart and all impurities will be burnt away.\u201d \u201cFire, though present in the firesticks, is not\nperceived until one stick is rubbed against another. The Self is like that fire: it is realized in the body by\nmeditation on the sacred syllable OM.\u201d Not only is the will to practice meditation produced by\nmeditation on Om, so is the goal\u2013enlightenment.\n\u201cLike a child well guarded in the womb\u201d\nThe propensity toward the Divine is rare, and it is also fragile because the downward pull accumulated\nin thousands of previous lives threaten its very existence. Consequently, the wise sadhaka guards it well\nonce it arises, ensuring that it can grow unhindered and in time come forth as the liberating force we\nneed to be successful yogis. The observance of Yama and Niyama are absolutely essential in this, as is\nthe need to reorder one\u2019s life so as not to put this developing power in danger of harm or destruction.\n\u201cWorshiped day by day by awakened souls\u201d\nThe idea of the previous section is being continued. The awakened (though no yet enlightened) soul\ncherishes the yogic will, and realizes that it is a worshipful thing\u2013the Godward-tending divine power of\nthe divine Self that moves within him like an embryo within the womb. Day by day he worships it by\nusing it to meditate.\n\u201cThose who offer oblations in sacrificial fire\u201d\nThose who are consciously engaging in Ishwarapranidhana, the offering of the life to God, extend the\npower of their spiritual will beyond the practice of meditation into every moment of their life and\nactivity, using it to accomplish a spiritualized mode of life. Here, too, the necessity for reordering the\nlife of the sadhaka is evident.\nMay that divine Agni be enkindled and maintained within us.\n\nThe Infinite Self\n\u201cWhat is within us is also without. What is without is also within. He who sees difference between\nwhat is within and what is without goes evermore from death to death.\u201d These words have various\nlevels of meaning, and we should consider them all.\nMicrocosms\nMany years ago, Dr. Judith Tyberg, a disciple of Sri Aurobindo and director of the East-West Cultural\nCenter in Los Angeles, told me that she had attended a lecture at Benares Hindu University in which a\nmap of the universe and charts from Gray\u2019s Anatomy were compared and seen to be strikingly alike.\nOur bodies are little models of the universe.\nSome months before she told this to me I had experienced this for myself. While meditating one day all\nordinary physical sensation vanished. Spatial relation ceased to exist and I found myself keenly aware\nof being beyond dimension, neither large nor small, but infinite (for infinity is beyond size). Although\nthe terminology is inappropriate to such a state, to make it somewhat understandable I have to say that I\nperceived an infinity of worlds \u201cwithin\u201d me. Suns\u2013some solo and others surrounded by planets\u2013\nglimmered inside my spaceless space. Not that I saw the light, but I felt or intuited it. Actually, I did not\n\u201csee\u201d anything\u2013and yet I did. It is not expressible in terms of ordinary sense experience, yet I must use\n\nthose terms. I experienced myself as everything that existed within the relative material universe. Or so\nit seemed, for the human body is a miniature universe, a microcosmic model of the macrocosm. The\nphysical human body is a reflection of the universal womb that conceived it. I had experienced the\nsubtle level of the physical body that is its ideational (i.e., causal) blueprint. On that level it can be\nexperienced as a map of the material creation.\nIn this matter, it was crucial that I not mistake the copy for the Original and think I was an infinite\nbeing or had attained Cosmic Consciousness. It was Macrocosmic Consciousness\u2013not an insignificant\nexperience, but certainly not the final step in evolution.\n\u201cAs above, so below\u201d\nIn the Hermetic Philosophy of the ancient Mediterranean world there was a principle: \u201cAs above, so\nbelow.\u201d That is, this material plane of existence is a mirroring of higher levels of being all the way up\nto the Absolute. Therefore, by studying earthly phenomena we can gain some idea of heavenly things.\nAlso, that material conditions are reflections of psychic forces. Astrology is an example of this. The\nphysical planets, through universal gravitation, certainly have some influence on our physical being,\nbut their movements are indications of the arising and subsiding of inner, subtle energies that greatly\naffect us, both psychologically and externally.\nWe need to realize that the inner is always more real than the outer. The thirty-fourth Ode of Solomon,\none of the earliest Christian hymns, says: \u201cThe likeness of that which is below is that which is above.\nFor everything is above, and below there is nothing, but it is believed to be by those in whom there is\nno knowledge.\u201d\nThis is also true in yoga. Everything real happens in the head\u2013the Sahasrara, the Thousand-petalled\nLotus, the astral/causal brain. This is why Paramhansa Nityananda told his students: \u201cAwareness\n[buddhi] should be concentrated in the head. Your attention should always be above the neck; never\nbelow the neck.\u201d Yogis should never look to or trust phenomena that take place in the body below the\nSahasrara.\nOuter/inner\nThe outer is the inner; the inner is the outer. We have touched on this slightly. It is of inestimable\nimportance to realize that our outer life is but a mirror image of our inner life, that whatever is taking\nplace in our external body and environment is happening in the depths of our mind. So by studying and\nanalyzing our outer life we come to gauge the true character of our inner life. This is not palatable to\nthe ego, for it means that our misfortunes are our own doing and reveal our inner negativity. As the\nChinese maxim has it: When mean-spirited people live behind the door, mean-spirited people come in\nfront of the door. So let us be careful before we indulge in a litany of all the wrongs we have suffered\nand all the bad people that have done those wrongs to us. We will only be confessing our own sins. It is\nnot sympathy we need, but self-correction. As a very wise book, The Astral City, says: \u201cSelf-pity is a\nsymptom of mental illness.\u201d\nConsistency\nIt is also necessary that our inner and outer lives be identical. We are all aware that very corrupt people\ncan act and speak in a seemingly virtuous way. Also, many soft-hearted people pretend to be callous or\neven prickly. But neither is admirable. \u201cWhat you see is what you get\u201d should be our rule of life. Our\nouter life must be an exact imaging of our inner life. In the Gospel of Thomas, section 22, Jesus tells\nhis disciples that they will enter the kingdom of God: \u201cWhen you make the two one, and when you\n\nmake the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below.\u201d\nThe inner and outer Reality\nGod is the inner, and God is the outer. \u201cHe who sees difference between what is within and what is\nwithout goes evermore from death to death.\u201d We are bound to the cycle of perpetual births and deaths\nuntil we see God, both within and without\u2013until we know that God is the sole reality of both \u201cthe\nworld\u201d and ourselves. In that vision we become immortal. The great Swami Sivananda wrote the\nfollowing expressing this truth:\nWhen I surveyed from Ananda Kutir, Rishikesh,\nBy the side of the Tehri Hills, only God I saw.\nIn the Ganges and the Kailas peak,\nIn the famous Chakra Tirtha of Naimisar also, only God I saw.\nIn tribulation and in grief, in joy and in glee,\nIn sickness and in sorrow, only God I saw.\nIn birds and dogs, in stones and trees,\nIn flowers and fruits, in the sun, moon and stars, only God I saw.\nIn the rosy cheeks of Kashmiri ladies,\nIn the black faces of African negroes, only God I saw.\nIn filth and scents, in poison and dainties,\nIn the market and in society, only God I saw.\nIn Brahmakara Vritti and Vedantic Nididhyasana,\nIn Atmic Vichara and Atmic Chintana, only God I saw.\nIn Kirtan and Nama Smaran, in Sravana and Vandana,\nIn Archana and Padasevana, in Dasya and Atmanivedana, only God I saw.\nLike camphor I was melting in His fire of knowledge,\nAmidst the flames outflashing, only God I saw.\nMy Prana entered the Brahmarandhra at the Moordha,\nThen I looked with God\u2019s eyes, only God I saw.\nI passed away into nothingness, I vanished,\nAnd lo, I was the all-living, only God I saw.\nI enjoyed the Divine Aisvarya, all God\u2019s Vibhutis,\nI had Visvaroopa Darshan, the Cosmic Consciousness, only God I saw.\nGlory, glory unto the Lord, hail! hail! hail! O sweet Ram.\nLet me sing once more Thy Name\u2014Ram Ram Ram, Om, Om, Om, only God I saw.\nThe seeing mind\nJesus, who said: \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God,\u201d had learned this well in India.\nFor the next verse of the Katha Upanishad tells us: \u201cBy the purified mind alone is the indivisible\nBrahman to be attained. Brahman alone is\u2013nothing else is. He who sees the manifold universe, and not\nthe one reality, goes evermore from death to death.\u201d\nThe necessary purification is profound, for Saint John tells us: \u201cEvery man that hath this hope in him\npurifieth himself, even as he [God] is pure.\u201d Those whose minds have been made pure in the\n\ncontemplation of God automatically see Him. As Patanjali explains: \u201cGod is a Spirit\u2026.\u2026His\ndesignator is Om. Its constant repetition and meditation is the way. From it result the disappearance of\nobstacles and the turning inward of consciousness.\u201d And, more importantly, they attain God, as the\nupanishad says. They come to know themselves as gods within God.\nThe universe and ourselves are in an ineffable way part of the indivisible Brahman. That is why Jesus\nsaid: \u201cThis is life eternal: that they might know thee the only true God.\u201d And why the upanishad tell us\nthat \u201cHe who sees the manifold universe, and not the one reality, goes evermore from death to death.\u201d\nThe upanishad calls us to see God and enter into Life Eternal.\n\nThe Dweller in the Heart\nFor numberless ages, in the rest of the world people were intent on the awesome greatness of God\u2013and\nnothing more. Whereas in India the sages were intent on the awesome greatness of both the individual\nand the Universal Selves. Perceiving their unity, they understood that whatever can be said about one\ncan be said about the other. Thus their teachings are a unique revelation of the true nature of us all.\nWithout this self-understanding, our life is nothing but confusion with a few random stumblings into\ninsight. It is an absolute necessity that we comprehend the upanishadic teachings and strive to gain the\nupanishadic vision.\nIn the lotus of the heart\n\u201cThat being, of the size of a thumb, dwells deep within the heart. He is the lord of time, past and future.\nHaving attained him, one fears no more. He, verily, is the immortal Self.\u201d This verse tells us several\nthings about our true Self.\nThat being, of the size of a thumb, dwells deep within the heart. Since the Self transcends space, how\ncan it have a measurable size? It cannot. Shankara explains in his commentary that \u201cthe lotus of the\nheart is of the size of a thumb. Existing in the space within the lotus of the heart, [the Self] has the size\nof a thumb, just like space existing in a section of a bamboo that is of the size of a thumb.\u201d Just as\nwater filling a vessel sunk in the ocean has volume and shape, in the same way the Self seems to have a\nshape and a measure. But once the vessel is broken, the shape and volume of the water cease to be, and\nso it is with the Self. Incarnate in a body, the Self pervades it and reflects it, but upon the dissolution of\nthe body those seeming conditions cease instantly, for they have no objective reality. So it is not the\nSelf that is really of the size of a thumb, but rather the lotus of the heart within which it momentarily\ndwells.\nWe should not mistake the lotus of the heart for the organ that pumps blood through the body. The real\nlotus of the heart is the core of the Thousand-Petalled Lotus, the Sahasrara located in the head. This\nthumb-shaped nucleus is also referred to in yogic teachings as \u201cthe Linga in the head.\u201d\n\u201cDeep within the heart\u201d indicates that the Self is the inmost level of our being, our absolute essence\nbeyond which we simply do not exist. It also indicates that to know ourself we must meditate and\npenetrate deep into our consciousness. There is no other way.\nHe is the lord of time, past and future. It is a grave error to think that we are helpless flotsam and\njetsam on the bosom of the ocean of Relativity, being moved about by forces such as karma, our\nthoughts, and even God. It is our own Self that determines whatever happens to us and is the sole\ncontroller of our past, present, and future. Look at the chaotic lives of those who \u201ctrust in God\u201d and\n\n\u201csurrender to the Divine Will.\u201d They rationalize their disordered state by saying they have peace of\nmind through their attitude, but that is a poor substitute for the truth. Look at how many people die\npeacefully. Peace counts for little when it is nothing more than an opiate. We must stop living a lie. It is\nnot our karma, our thinking, or even God that ordains our life. It is our Self. And until we unite our\nawareness with the Self we shall know nothing but uncertainty and confusion. But when we do,\n\u201csorrow melts into that clear peace\u201d which is ours forever.\nHaving attained him, one fears no more. For what can produce fear in the knower of the Self? As Emily\nBronte wrote:\nO God within my breast, Almighty, ever-present Deity! Life, that in me has rest, As I, undying Life,\nhave power in Thee!\nVain are the thousand creeds That move men\u2019s hearts: unutterably vain; Worthless as withered weeds,\nOr idlest froth amid the boundless main,\nTo waken doubt in one Holding so fast by Thy infinity, So surely anchored on The steadfast rock of\nImmortality.\nThe smokeless flame\n\u201cThat being, of the size of a thumb, is like a flame without smoke. He is the lord of time, past and\nfuture, the same today and tomorrow. He, verily, is the immortal Self.\u201d Now we learn some more\nessential facts about our Self.\nLike a flame without smoke. The Self is pure light without covering or admixture. In our present state\nof delusion we think that the Self can be inhibited and even corrupted, but that is not so. The various\nenergy levels within which the Self is dwelling certainly can be inhibited, corrupted, and even\ndestroyed. If we identify with those levels we will live in fear and uncertainty, relieved only\noccasionally by utterly false hopes. \u201cIt is your ignorance, it is the world\u2019s delusion that gives you these\ndreams\u201d of both hope and fear. But once our consciousness is posited in the Self, all that is past,\ndispelled by the eternal Light of the Self.\nThe same today and tomorrow. The changeless nature of the Self puts us beyond all fear, concern, and\nanxiety, \u201cknowing It birthless, knowing It deathless, knowing It endless, for ever unchanging.\u201d The Self\nreally has no past, present or future. It is, itself, the Eternal Now.\nLiberating unity\n\u201cAs rain, fallen on a hill, streams down its side, so runs he after many births who sees manifoldness in\nthe Self.\u201d The \u201cgravity\u201d of delusion pulls inexorably downward those who think that the many layers of\ntheir incarnate existence are the Self. Yet, they do not think they are enslaved by the consequences of\ntheir ignorance, but think they have free will as they \u201crun\u201d into the valleys of darkness and pain. \u201cIt\u2019s\nmy life, and I will do what I want to,\u201d they shout as they roll downward into the jaws of sorrow and\ndeath. Only when the unity of our Self is known\u2013both in the fact of its unitary state of being and its\neternal oneness with Brahman\u2013will the earthward pull disappear along with the compulsion to\ncontinual rebirth. \u201cIf a man sees Brahman in every action, He will find Brahman.\u201d It is as simple as\nthat.\nEver the same\n\u201cAs pure water poured into pure water remains pure, so does the Self remain pure, O Nachiketa, uniting\n\nwith Brahman.\u201d\nWe and Brahman are one Substance. There is no difference. We are not \u201ccreations,\u201d we are\nbeginningless and endless, co-eternal with God. Knowing this makes all the difference\u2013the only\ndifference we need. Brahman is Pure Being and we are Pure Being. Uniting with Brahman we remain\nwhat we always have been, but no longer subject to ignorance and delusion. As Jesus said: \u201cHim that\novercometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out.\u201d The Self does\nnot change, but becomes irrevocably established in the consciousness of its changelessness.\n\nThe Birthless Self\nThe subject of the Self is virtually inexhaustible. It is the sole object of the upanishads. So Yamaraj\ncontinues to expound the Self to Nachiketa.\n\u201cTo the Birthless, the light of whose consciousness forever shines, belongs the city of eleven gates. He\nwho meditates on the ruler of that city knows no more sorrow. He attains liberation, and for him there\ncan no longer be birth or death. For the ruler of that city is the immortal Self.\u201d\nThis verse tells us many aspects of the Self, each of which should be scrutinized in turn.\nBirthless\nA cornerstone of Eastern wisdom is the understanding that verbal formulas can never encompass the\ntruth, but can only be hints, albeit excellent hints\u2013that truth is always beyond books, concepts, and\nwords; that in time the aspirant must pass beyond them into the level of spiritual intuition in which\ndirect knowledge is possible. Yet it is understood that the aspirant will not be able to fully translate such\ndirect knowledge into words. As the adage says: \u201cHe who knows tells it not; he who tells knows it not.\u201d\nNot from an attitude of arcane secrecy (always a symptom of spiritual pathology), but from the fact that\nknowing transcends speech and (discursive) thought.\nNevertheless, \u201cAccording to your faith be it unto you.\u201d And faith is conceptual, even if not fully verbal.\nConsequently, our ideas about ourselves, our nature, and our life have a profound influence on our life\nand its unfoldment. If we think we are sinful mortals, we shall live like sinful mortals, incapable of\nreaching God. If we think we are evolving consciousness, moving onward to spiritual heights, we shall\nevolve beyond human limitations. But if we think we are eternal beings, part of God\u2019s infinite Being,\nwe shall rise to the state of Divine Unity and manifest the declaration: \u201cYe are gods.\u201d\nIt is necessary, then, for us to firmly set in mind that we are birthless beings, that we have never \u201ccome\ninto being\u201d or been \u201ccreated.\u201d Rather, we are co-eternal with God, the Essence of our existence. We\nnever came into being, nor shall we ever cease to be. When we understand that our consciousness is\nsomehow a wave of the Infinite Consciousness that is God, that we are irrevocably a part of God\u2019s\ninfinite Light and Life, it will have a transforming effect on us.\nSri Ramakrishna was fond of the simile of a washerman\u2019s donkey. Each night the washerman passes a\nrope around the legs of the donkey and then removes it. The donkey believes it has been tied, so it\nnever tries to move away from that spot. Its bondage is imaginary, yet because of its belief it is as\nbound as though it were tied. It is the same with us. If we believe we are bound, we shall be bound. But\nif we believe we are free we can manifest that freedom. This is what yoga\u2013and yoga alone\u2013is all about.\nThe light of consciousness\n\nGod cannot be defined, but it can be said that God is Light\u2013even more, that God is the Light that is\nLife. In other words, God is Conscious Light. And so are we. If this is realized, then we will not\nidentify with the change and dissolution that is inherent in relative existence. The hymn says: \u201cChange\nand decay in all around I see; O Thou Who changest not, abide with me.\u201d The mistake is in thinking\nthat what is needed is God as a separate being, when what is really needed is the abiding awareness of\nour own Self, of which God is the Essence. As the Psalmist sang: \u201cI shall be satisfied, when I awake,\nwith thy likeness.\u2026When I awake, I am still with thee.\u201d\nForever shines\nOur divine nature may be obscured to our earthly eyes in the way that clouds can hide the sun and even\nmake the earth dark. But the sun ever shines. Night occurs because of the turning of the earth, and\nspiritual ignorance and darkness arise because our awareness is turned wrong. Yet, as Buddha said:\n\u201cTurn around and lo! The Other Shore.\u201d And Jesus said over and over: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is at\nhand\u201d\u2013right here where it has always been. It is only a matter of attunement of consciousness. Again,\nthat is where yoga comes in.\nThe Self is what It is forever, nothing can alter that. So what we need is a recovering of Consciousness.\nIt need not be produced or even gained\u2013only recognized. This is difficult for us to grasp since we have\nbecome habituated to the ways of relativity in which everything is a \u201cprocess\u201d moving along in stages.\nYoga reveals the Truth of our Selves, and since the clouds of illusion have to be moved aside to reveal\nthe ever-shining Self, yoga appears to be a process, too, but essentially it is not. Yoga is simply Seeing\nTrue.\nThe city of eleven gates\nThe human body is usually called \u201cthe city of nine gates\u201d for the nine apertures of the body, but here it\nhas the number eleven. Shankara says this is because the navel and the Brahmarandhra, the \u201csoft spot\u201d\nat the crown of the head are also being counted as gates. This is appropriate, as before birth we are\nnourished through the navel, and at death we often depart through the Brahmarandhra.\nThe important point that is being made here is in contradistinction to religions other than Hinduism,\nand even to the attitudes found today in contemporary Indian philosophy. For it is commonly thought\nvery \u201cspiritual\u201d to disregard the body, push it aside in our consciousness, and despise it as a liability\nand even a prison. But the upanishad tells us that the body is not alien to the Self (atman), but rather\nbelongs to the Self, just as the cosmos belongs to God\u2013and is in a sense the \u201cbody\u201d of God. (It is\nimportant to continually keep in mind that whatever can be said of God can usually be said about the\nindividual being, as well.) The body is ours, and is fundamentally a mirroring of our personal\nconsciousness, which is why we can legitimately speak of \u201cthe body-mind connection.\u201d\nThe body is the vehicle through which the individual evolves during the span of life on earth, and must\nbe taken into serious account by the yogi who will discover that the body can exert a necessary effect\non the mind. For example, the yogi meditates and discovers that the process of yoga takes place in the\nthousand-petalled lotus of the brain. For, as Paramhansa Nityananda said: \u201cAll takes place to a raja\nyogi in the brain center.\u2026What is called Raja Yoga is above the neck.\u201d Furthermore, the yogi joins the\njapa (repetition) of Om to the breath\u2013a physical process known as pranayama.\nThe yogi who observes will discover that the diet of the physical body is also the diet of the mind, that\nwhatever is eaten physically will have an effect mentally. One who does not know this is no yogi at all.\nNo more sorrow\n\n\u201cHe who meditates on the ruler of that city knows no more sorrow.\u201d When we meditate on our Self, our\natman, we will end all sorrow. The Gita says of the yogi who meditates on the Self: \u201cTo obey the\nAtman is his peaceful joy; sorrow melts into that clear peace: his quiet mind is soon established in\npeace.\u201d \u201cWhen, through the practice of yoga, the mind ceases its restless movements, and becomes\nstill, he realizes the Atman. It satisfies him entirely. Then he knows that infinite happiness which can be\nrealized by the purified heart but is beyond the grasp of the senses. He stands firm in this realization.\nBecause of it, he can never again wander from the inmost truth of his being. Now that he holds it he\nknows this treasure above all others: faith so certain shall never be shaken by heaviest sorrow. To\nachieve this certainty is to know the real meaning of the word yoga. It is the breaking of contact with\npain. You must practice this yoga resolutely, without losing heart.\u201d\nWe must meditate on the Self\u2013not on external deities or symbolic forms of psychic states. As Sri Ma\nSarada Devi said: \u201cAfter attaining wisdom one sees that gods and deities are all maya.\u201d The\nupanishads, Gita, and Yoga Sutras know nothing of meditating on \u201cishta devatas\u201d\u2013only on Om, for Om\nis our Self. Here are a few upanishadic statements on the subject:\n\u201cThe Self is of the nature of the Syllable Om.\u201d\n\u201cDirectly realize the self by meditating on Om.\u201d\n\u201cThe Self is of the nature of the Syllable Om. Thus the Syllable Om is the very Self.\u201d\n\u201cMeditate on Om as the Self.\u201d\n\u201cOm is the atman himself.\u201d\n\u201cOm is a single syllable that is of the nature of the Self.\u2026Om is the true form of the Self.\u201d\nLiberation\u2013no longer birth or death\n\u201cHe attains liberation, and for him there can no longer be birth or death.\u201d\nThere is no need for commentary, but here is some corroboration:\n\u201cKnow this Atman unborn, undying, never ceasing, never beginning, deathless, birthless, how\ncan It die the death of the body?\u201d\n\u201cThe seers\u2026reach enlightenment. Then they are free from the bondage of rebirth, and pass to\nthat state which is beyond all evil.\u201d\n\u201cKnowing the Atman, man finds Nirvana that is in Brahman, here and hereafter.\u201d\nImmortal\n\u201cFor the ruler of that city is the immortal Self.\u201d\nThe Gita encapsulates it perfectly:\n\u201cThis true wisdom I have taught will lead you to immortality. The faithful practice it with devotion,\ntaking me for their highest aim. To me they surrender heart and mind. They are exceedingly dear to\nme.\u201d\n\u201cFor I am Brahman within this body, life immortal that shall not perish: I am the Truth and the Joy for\never.\u201d\n\nThe Shining Self\n\u201cThe immortal Self is the sun shining in the sky, he is the breeze blowing in space, he is the fire\nburning on the altar, he is the guest dwelling in the house; he is in all men, he is in the gods, he is in the\nether, he is wherever there is truth; he is the fish that is born in water, he is the plant that grows in the\nsoil, he is the river that gushes from the mountain\u2013he, the changeless reality, the illimitable!\u201d\nWhere in all the scriptures of the world can we find such a thrilling statement\u2013thrilling and glorious\nbecause it is TRUE?\nThe two that are One\nTo fully comprehend the teachings of the upanishadic sages we must keep in mind that whatever can be\nsaid of the Paramatman on the cosmic, universal level can usually also be said of the jivatman on the\nlevel of our individual life within the cosmos. So the upanishads are describing not only God, the\nSupreme Spirit, but the nature of our own individual spirit.\nWhat is needed\nThere is another, essential, side to this upanishadic statement\u2013and indeed to all scriptural teachings\u2013that\nmust be kept in mind at all times in our study: We must experience and know the realities spoken of by\nthe sages. They did not write down their perceptions for us to merely accept them and be intellectually\nconvinced of their veracity. Rather, they wrote them down as signposts so we could check our own\nperceptions against them. Never did they mean for their writings to become dogmas and doctrines.\nThey assume that their readers will be yogis like themselves, sadhaka-pilgrims pressing on toward the\nultimate frontiers of consciousness.\nThis is the absolutely unique character of the basic texts of Sanatana Dharma. All other scriptures,\nincluding those of later authorship in India as well as those of other religions, are statements of \u201ctruths\u201d\nwe are supposed to accept \u201con faith\u201d without question. This is why intelligent investigation and\nanalysis are so little valued by the expounders of those scriptures, why nearly all religions warn their\nadherents away from reading the books of \u201cheretics\u201d and demand that they shun their company.\nIntellectual fearlessness terrifies \u201cthe chosen faithful\u201d and sets their teeth on edge.\nBut no religious system that employs a single bond can lead us to freedom. For example, in Yoga, yama\nand niyama are not \u201ccommandments\u201d but helpful information. Just as we learn what food is harmful to\nthe body, so from Patanjali we learn what conduct limits and clouds the consciousness of the aspiring\nyogi. If we wish to ignore his counsel, that is our own concern. No one will call us to account for our\nheedlessness except our own Self. Those who are fit to be yogis joyfully learn what to cultivate and\nwhat to avoid, and live accordingly. Those who drag their feet, sigh, and sullenly demand mitigations,\nare simply not fit for yoga and should occupy themselves in other areas. This is why Jesus asked:\n\u201cWhich of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he\nhave sufficient to finish it? Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all\nthat behold it begin to mock him, saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.\u201d\nEvery yogi must be adhikarin\u2013qualified and worthy, fit for yoga and capable of its total practice. Jesus\nsaid: \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke\nupon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For\nmy yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d It is interesting that he likens spiritual life to the cumbersome\nwooden yoke of oxen or bullocks, assuring us that it will be restful and easy and light to bear. How is\n\nthis? To a strong ox or bullock the heaviest of yokes will be of no consequence. So if we are the kind of\npeople for whom yoga is intended, its requirements and disciplines will be light and easeful. But if,\ninstead of being oxen or bullocks we are dogs and swine\u2013symbols used by Jesus for the unworthy\u2013the\n\u201clight and easy\u201d yoke will break our backs! This is why some people should take up bowling or surfing\nand forget religion altogether, what to say of yoga.\nFor the serious seekers, though, the ancient rishis hold back nothing, but give the full picture of the\nSelf.\n\u201cThe immortal Self\u201d\nThe self can appear (please note I say \u201cappear\u201d) to enter into numberless conditions and interior states.\nIt even experiences millions of births and deaths, yet It never really dies, for immortality is a\nfundamental trait of Its nature. It is not easy, but the yogi must cultivate a continual awareness that he is\nImmortal Being\u2013never anything less, and never anything more\u2013and order his life accordingly. I do not\nmean by this that he denies his present (seeming) condition, but that, as Yogananda continually advised,\nhe is always aware that he is only sitting in the motion picture theatre of the cosmos watching a movie\nthat, cosmic as its scope may be, can be wiped away in a moment, that only he and the other viewers\nare real, that all must eventually leave the theater and go home to Infinity. How splendid are the truths\nof the Vedanta!\n\u201cThe sun\u201d\nThe Self is the source of all light\u2013the Inner Light of Consciousness that illumines all things. For outside\nthe Self there is no perception of even the brightest of material suns. It is the presence of the Self that\nproduces awareness of all phenomena. Outside the Self nothing at all exists. Within the Self is\neverything.\n\u201cShining in the sky\u201d\nThe Self shines in the \u201csky\u201d of the Chidakasha, the subtle Ether (Akasha). The Chidakasha is the\ninfinite, all-pervading expanse of Consciousness from which all \u201cthings\u201d proceed; the true \u201cheart\u201d of\nall things. The \u201cshining\u201d of the Self in the Chidakasha is the emanation of Om. In the individual, the\nChidakasha is the subtle space of Consciousness located in the Sahasrara, the Thousand-petalled Lotus\nthat is the astral/causal brain. From that point Om, the Word of Life (Pranava) enlivens and illumines\nall things; which is why we meditate upon Om in the head.\n\u201cThe breeze blowing in space\u201d\nThe Self is also that power which moves within the Chidakasha as the wind moves within earthly\nspace. As the wind causes movement in the trees and on the surfaces of earth and water, in the same\nway it is the Self that produces all movement in the cosmos, in all the worlds gross and subtle.\n\u201cThe fire burning on the altar\u201d\nThe Self is the transmuting force of Cosmic Fire on the altar of the universe. In India of the upanishadic\nrishis there were no temples, nor were there any external religious rites other than the sandhya\n(morning and evening salutations of the sun) and the havan, the fire ritual in which by the agency of\nconsecrated fire the offerings were transformed into subtle energy forms and transferred into higher\nworlds. The Self, then is the ultimate transmuting power which evolves both the cosmos and the\npersonal energies of the individual spirits within it. The entire universe is an altar in which, through the\npower of the Self, all things are offerings unto\u2013and into\u2013Infinite Being.\n\n\u201cThe guest dwelling in the house\u201d\nAll things, even the least atom, are \u201chouses\u201d for the all-pervading Self. All things that exist have the\nSelf as their inmost dweller. Where there is any objecting \u201cthing,\u201d there is the Self. Yet, since no things\nare permanent, the Self is only a momentary Guest\u2013but none the less real for that.\n\u201cIn all men\u201d\nWhat is meaningful to us is the truth that the Self is the dweller in all consciousness beings. And since\nthey are not \u201cthings,\u201d the Self is not a guest but the permanent Indweller as the Self of the Self. The\nconsciousness of each one of is the only temple is which Spirit ever dwells in Its essential being.\nAlthough it can be said that in a sense our bodies are temples of God, that is not really true in the purest\nsense. Only in our consciousness is Spirit to be found. This is why the Upanishads and the Bhagavad\nGita insist that we must identify with the Self alone, seeing all else as mirages destined to dissolve\naway and cease to exist. Their message has been summed up by Shankara in these words: \u201cBrahman is\nreal. The world is illusory. The jiva is nothing but Brahman.\u201d\n\u201cIn the gods\u201d\nIn the upanishads, \u201cgods\u201d mean not only highly evolved beings that can control the forces of nature,\netc., \u201cgods\u201d are also our higher faculties of perception which illumine our awareness of both the inner\nand outer worlds. Here the idea is that the Self is the enlivening power by which our higher faculties\nfunction.\n\u201cIn the ether\u201d\nThe Ether, the Chidakasha, is the natural home of the Self. Only in this inmost level of being can the\nSelf be always perceived. In the lesser levels we usually \u201close\u201d the Self by losing perception of It. How\ncan we establish ourselves in \u201cetheric awareness\u201d? Through the unique property of akasha: sound\u2013\nspecifically, through the japa and meditation of Om, as Patanjali has stated in the Yoga Sutras. In the\nVedanta Sutras of the sage Vyasa (also called the Brahma Sutras) he tells us: \u201cAnavrittih shabdai\u2013By\nsound vibration one becomes liberated.\u201d\n\u201cWherever there is truth\u201d\nWherever there is true knowing, there the Self is operative as the Sun of Consciousness, revealing both\nrelative and absolute truth. For Truth is Its nature. A popular Sanskrit adage is: \u201cTruth alone conquers,\u201d\nmeaning that victory over ignorance and bondage is found only in the Self, the ultimate Truth.\n\u201cThe fish that is born in water\u201d\nEgotism is a prime train of human beings\u2013usually in the form of outright arrogance. In religion this\nmanifests in the insistence that human beings are superior to all other beings. Even in India we have the\nidea that \u201ceven the gods pray for human birth\u201d because supposedly only human beings can be\nenlightened. In Christianity there is an insistence that human beings are higher than angels because they\nalone can be \u201csaved\u201d through Christ. In the most ignorant of religions there is the insistence that only\nhuman beings are immortal and that animals are some kind of animated machines, that human beings\nalone are \u201cin the image of God\u201d and suchlike.\nTherefore the upanishad tells us the truth: that even in the dullest of animals\u2013the fish\u2013the Self is\npresent, that the fish is the Self in manifestation, as are we.\n\n\u201cThe plant that grows in the soil\u201d\nLest we confine the Self to animal life, the upanishad further tells us that plants are dwellingplaces of\nthe Self, too.\n\u201cThe river that gushes from the mountain\u201d\nAnd lest we think that the Self in only in \u201cliving\u201d things, the seers assure us that in inanimate things the\nSelf is living and moving. Everything is alive in Spirit. What a sublime world-view!\n\u201cThe changeless reality\u201d\nAll the things listed as abodes of the Self are ever-changing, and their forms are evanescent, soon seen\nto be without permanent reality. Since we identify with what we see around us, we continually fall into\nthe snare of thinking that we, too, change and have no ultimate reality. Even if we think otherwise\nintellectually, we keep acting in a delusive manner. Hence we must keep reminding ourselves that we\nare changeless and absolutely real.\n\u201cThe illimitable\u201d\nEqually wonderful is the truth that we are beyond limitation, that infinite are our possibilities\u2013for we\nare the Infinite Self.\nThe call\nThose who embodied their realizations in the upanishads did not do so to furnish us with a bundle of\nbeliefs to \u201ctake on faith\u201d and wrangle over. Their intention was to spur us onward to attain the same\nvision as they possessed, to be sages equal with them, no longer \u201cservants\u201d but \u201cfriends.\u201d Their call to\nus is the same as that of Swami Vivekananda, who continually exhorted his hearers: \u201cAwake! Arise!\u201d\n\nThe Life-Giving Self\nJust as children babble on aimlessly about things they do not understand, so we do the same, though in\na more sophisticated way, especially in religion and philosophy. So the three verses relating to the Self\nand life are very much needed by us. First the upanishad tells us:\n\u201cHe, the adorable one, seated in the heart, is the power that gives breath. Unto him all the senses do\nhomage.\u201d\nAdorable\nThe word Prabhavananda translates \u201cadorable\u201d is vamanam, which means adorable, dear, and pleasing.\nThese epithets are traditionally used in relation to Shiva, the symbol of the atman and atmic\nconsciousness. This is important, for the Self is not just Truth or Reality\u2013a mere abstraction\u2013but when\nexperienced as either the individual Self or the Supreme Self produces in us a personal response,\nliterally the response of bhakti (devotion) and even prema (love).\nIn contemporary India there is the idea that bhakti and prema can only be experienced toward a being\nthat possesses form (rupa) or qualities (guna)\u2013that it is impossible to have these responses to Brahman\nthe transcendent Being. But in the upanishads and the Gita we are constantly exhorted to love\nBrahman\u2013not just some \u201cforms\u201d of Brahman\u2013and the atman. This also indicates that the ancient\nupanishadic sages did not believe that the Absolute or the Self was without attributes of any kind.\n\nRather, they considered that, although anything said would be only approximations of divine realities,\nstill human beings could conceive of God in at least a dim way. And they absolutely could experience\nGod, and have reactions and definitions arising from their experience. In Chapter Twelve Krishna\nspeaks of this in more detail, and we will consider it there.\nTo the yogi, then, the Self and Brahman are equally adorable.\nSeated in the heart\nGod and the Self are seated in the heart, as the upanishads and the Gita continually emphasize. There\nthey abide permanently\u2013it is not a matter of occasional visitations. Knowing this, Jesus said: \u201cBehold,\nthe kingdom of God is within you.\u201d This, too, is a matter of direct experience. Saint Luke used the\nword idou\u2013in other words, \u201cSee for yourself that the kingdom of God is within you.\u201d This is not\nsomething Jesus wants us to believe and act on blindly\u2013he wants us to experience this truth, for only\nexperience produces lasting effects.\nThe heart is the throne of God and the throne of the divine Self. When Jesus says: \u201cTo him that\novercometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my\nFather in his throne,\u201d he is speaking of our heart\u2013not his. Our heart and the heart of God are not the\nsame, but they are ONE.\nPower that gives breath\nThe upanishads literally say that it is the Self which produces our inhalations and exhalations. \u201cWho\ncould live, who could breathe, if that blissful self dwelt not within the lotus of the heart?\u201d \u201cThe Self is\nthe breath of the breath.\u201d \u201cThe breaths are the Real, and their Reality is the Self.\u201d \u201cHe who breathes in\nwith your breathing in is your Self. He who breathes out with your breathing out is your Self.\u201d \u201cFrom\nhim is born the breath.\u201d \u201cThe shining, immortal person who is breath is the Self, is Brahman.\u201d \u201cWhich\nis the one God? The breath. He is Brahman.\u201d\nIn the spiritual texts of India the word hridaya\u2013heart\u2013means not just the heart, or core, but also is said\nto indicate the space (akasha) where the inbreath and outbreath merge\u2013the ultimate heart. This is why\nyoga must involve working with the inhaling and exhalation breaths in the form of subtle pranayama.\n\u201cThe breath is the Supreme Brahman. The breath never deserts him who, knowing thus, meditates upon\nit. Having become a god, he goes to the gods.\u201d \u201cThey who know the breath of the breath\u2026have\nrealized the ancient, primordial Brahman.\u201d\nThe senses do homage\nIn the primal texts of Sanatana Dharma we find references to \u201cgods\u201d (devas). In modern Hinduism we\nfind a panorama of all kinds of gods, demigods, and suchlike, so it is supposed that the ancient tests\nrefer to them when speaking of \u201cdevas.\u201d But a simple perusal of the context of those references reveal\nthat the upanishadic sages meant the senses (jnanendriyas), not some kind of external deific\nintelligences.\nThe senses \u201cdo homage\u201d in the sense that in the evolved individual they draw near to (upasate) and\nbecome merged in the Self, which is their source. Now this tells us two interesting and usually\nunsuspected things. First, that it is natural for the Self to control the senses, not to be their slave.\nSecond, it is completely natural for the senses to move inward toward the Self and experience the Self\nby uniting with It. Neither of these is our present experience. Rather, we consider it normal for the Self\nto be bound by the senses, and for it to require great struggle to turn them inward and bring them to\n\nexperience of the Self. Evidently we have lived in a subnormal condition so long that we have come to\nthink subnormality is normal. We are like the drunk man who was walking along with one foot on the\nsidewalk and the other down in the street. When someone stopped him and asked why he was walking\nthat way, he burst into tears and answered: \u201cThank God! I thought I was a cripple.\u201d\nBasically, the Self is the goal of all.\nThe essence\nThe upanishad then asks: \u201cWhat can remain when the dweller in this body leaves the outgrown shell,\nsince he is, verily, the immortal Self?\u201d The answer is quite simple: nothing but the body remains, for\nthe Self is as different from the body as the pearl is from the oyster and its shell. The departure of the\nSelf produces death and decay, for it is the Self alone that gives\u2013and is\u2013life, the sustenance of the body.\nJesus, Himself a yogi having lived over half of his life in India, said: \u201cMan shall not live by bread\nalone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u201d That is, we live not on matter, but\non the very Life of God\u2013because matter is only a modification of that Life Energy. The upanishad\u2013\nwhich Jesus would have known\u2013expresses the same idea by saying: \u201cMan does not live by breath\nalone, but by him in whom is the power of breath.\u201d\nIt is not breath that makes us live\u2013though breath is the basis of our body\u2019s metabolism. This is why\nyogis can live without the physical act of breathing. What we cannot do without, and by which we do\nlive is Him who is the source of breath, especially in His primeval form: Om, the Pranava, the LifeGiver, the Word of Life. Through the repetition and meditation of Om as recommended by Patanjali we\nenter into communication with the Lord, Ishwara, and then into unity with Him.\n\u201cFor in him we live, and move, and have our being.\u201d\n\nThe Eternal Brahman\u2013The Eternal Self\nBrahman and the Self\n\u201cAnd now, O Nachiketa, will I tell thee of the unseen, the eternal Brahman, and of what befalls the Self\nafter death.\u201d\nThis is an interesting juxtaposition: Brahman and the Self after death (of the body). The upanishad puts\nthese together because Brahman and the Self are one, and after death the spirit recovers the memory of\nits immortality\u2013its eternity. One with Brahman, the Self yet experiences many changes. Those changes\nmay only be appearances, but they are nonetheless real, and profoundly affect the Self in its\nevolutionary journey. So they need to be set forth.\nThe ignorant\n\u201cOf those ignorant of the Self, some enter into beings possessed of wombs, others enter into plants\u2013\naccording to their deeds and the growth of their intelligence.\u201d\nHere again we have a most interesting thing. Instead of discussing the worlds entered by the spirit after\nbodily death, and their nature as reflections of the spirit\u2019s karma, physical rebirth is immediately being\nspoken of. This is because it takes a goodly degree of evolution for the subtle worlds to have meaning\nfor the developing spirit. The undeveloped learn neither from earthly or astral experiences. Further,\nmany of them simply go to sleep at the moment of death and awaken only at the moment of birth. The\n\nperiod of time in between does not exist for them in any meaningful sense.\nIn his commentary on this verse Shankara cites another upanishadic statement: \u201cCreatures are born in\naccordance with their knowledge.\u201d For evolution is a matter of knowing (jnana). The spirits that are\nunaware of their true nature come back into two general categories: into living organisms that gestate\nthem in some form or other, and plant life. Obviously, very little goes on in the life of the plant as far as\nconsciousness is concerned. Only those who are \u201cborn\u201d and live a life with some degree of control over\na body vehicle can develop their consciousness to any significant extent.\nImplicit in this verse is the principle of the transmigration of the atman from lower to higher forms of\nlife. We start out as atoms of hydrogen, move into mineral forms, then plant forms, then \u201cliving\u201d\norganisms, and then into the human body from which we shall eventually evolve into forms in higher\nworlds. For most of the time evolution is automatic and incredibly slow. But at some point we become\ncapable of directing and enhancing our evolutionary movement. At first this is only through thinking\nand acting, but eventually we become capable of yoga, of fully taking charge of our growth in\nconsciousness. Until this point is reached, little of any importance occurs to us. So the upanishad is\nstarting at a basic rung of the ladder of evolution. But since, as I have said, nothing of much value take\nplace on that level, the upanishad moves ahead quite a bit to the level when we are capable of\ndreaming\u2013to at least the intelligent animal level.\nDream creation\n\u201cThat which is awake in us even while we sleep, shaping in dream the objects of our desire\u2013that indeed\nis pure, that is Brahman, and that verily is called the Immortal. All the worlds have their being in that,\nand no one can transcend it. That is the Self.\u201d\nIt is a fundamental assertion of India\u2019s primal wisdom that there are four states of consciousness: jagrat\n(waking), swapna (dreaming), sushupti (dreamless sleep), and turiya, the pure consciousness that\nwitnesses the first three. Turiya is the state proper to the Self\u2013actually is the Self\u2013which is why this\nverse speaks of It as \u201cthat which is awake in us even while we sleep.\u201d\n\u201cShaping in dream the objects of our desire.\u201d But there is more to this Self than consciousness. It is\nalso creative power. Although as yogis we use the terminology of Sankhya and speak of Purusha and\nPrakriti as two entities, we are only speaking of two aspects or views of the One Existence. They are\nabsolutely One. The upanishad reveals this by telling us that the Self is not only Witness, It is also the\nWitnessed.\nThe Self is desireless, yet it shows us in dreams the things we desire. Why? Because the Self is more\nthan Witness, It is Guide and Guru. In every way it is attempting to show us our present spiritual status.\nDreams are one of the avenues for its teaching. It is true that dreams arise from the subconscious, but\nthey do so at the impulse of the Self. Unfortunately our subconscious is distorted, like a badly ground\nlens, so the original imaging of the Self comes through to us distorted or partial, and the message is\nflawed. However, the more we clarify our minds through meditation, the more faithful our dreams will\nbe to the original impulses from the Self. In time our dreams can become authentic spiritual visions, at\nleast on occasion.\nAlthough showing us our desires, the Self remains pure\u2013the actual word being \u201cwhite\u201d to signify that\nthe Self has no inherent \u201ccolors\u201d (qualities or traits), for it is Brahman by nature. Thus it is also\nimmortal, no matter how many \u201cdeaths\u201d we may experience, both through the death of the body and\nthe \u201clittle death\u201d we experience each time we sleep\u2013dreams being a kind of \u201cafter death\u201d astral\nexperience.\n\nAll \u201cworlds,\u201d all levels of experience, arise from the Self in Union with Brahman. Nothing exists apart\nfrom the Self. The Self is also the ultimate Being. There is no \u201cgoing beyond\u201d it. Because it is one with\nBrahman, even conscious union with Brahman does not cancel out our awareness of the individual\nAtman. This is a most important principle, for many are led into the delusion that they have\ntranscended the Self and \u201centered the Not-Self,\u201d when they have merely sunk into the morass of\ntamasic ignorance. They are suffering from the subtlest form of mental illness which in time will\nmanifest as recognizable psychosis and lead to great mental and moral disintegration\u2013in many\ninstances to attempted or successful suicide.\nThe indwelling Self\n\u201cAs fire, though one, takes the shape of every object which it consumes, so the Self, though one, takes\nthe shape of every object in which it dwells. As air, though one, takes the shape of every object which it\nenters, so the Self, though one, takes the shape of every object in which it dwells.\u201d\nEach individual Self inhabits a vast number of body-vehicles as it moves up the ladder of evolution to\nthe Highest. (For a detailed study of this, see .) And in each one it appears to actually become that\nvehicle. Yet the Self remains only Itself, one and unique. In this way the Self gathers experiences of\nevery form of life that exists. This is necessary for It if It is to approximate the status of Brahman, for\nBrahman, existing in all forms, has the experience of \u201cbeing\u201d all those forms. Hence the microcosmic\nSelf mirrors the Macrocosmic Self.\nThe untouched Self\n\u201cAs the sun, revealer of all objects to the seer, is not harmed by the sinful eye, nor by the impurities of\nthe objects it gazes on, so the one Self, dwelling in all, is not touched by the evils of the world. For he\ntranscends all.\u201d\nHaving spoken to us of the fact that the Self somehow takes on the form of its many incarnational\nforms, the upanishad reminds us that the Self is nonetheless absolutely unmarked by that \u201cformation\u201d\nand undergoes no alteration or conditioning whatsoever. Even while immanent in relative existence, the\nSelf remains essentially transcendent, in the same relation to its incarnate form as is Brahman to the\nuniverse. The divine eye of the Self illumines all things yet is affected by none.\nBliss and peace\n\u201cHe is one, the lord and innermost Self of all; of one form, he makes of himself many forms. To him\nwho sees the Self revealed in his own heart belongs eternal bliss\u2013to none else, to none else!\u201d\nThe Self is ever the Master, however much the forms inhabited by the Self may be bound. The Self is\nthe essential principle of the existence of all those forms, always remaining one and unchanged. He\nalone who beholds the Self in/as the core of his being possesses eternal bliss.\n\u201cIntelligence of the intelligent, eternal among the transient, he, though one, makes possible the desires\nof many. To him who sees the Self revealed in his own heart belongs eternal peace\u2013to none else, to\nnone else!\u201d\nConsciousness of the conscious, the eternal link between all the temporal bodies Its inhabits, the Self it\nis that which \u201cmakes possible the desires of many\u201d through countless incarnations. He alone who\nbeholds the Self in/as the core of his being possesses eternal peace.\n\nThe Radiant Self\nYamaraj has presented his student with a great deal of philosophical knowledge regarding the Self. This\nis all valuable, but Nachiketa feels impelled to ask a question, without the answer to which all the\nteaching on the Self means nothing. He asks: \u201cHow O King, shall I find that blissful Self, supreme,\nineffable, who is attained by the wise? Does he shine by himself, or does he reflect another\u2019s light?\u201d It\nis pointless to hear about the Self if we do not know how to find the Self. It is true that in metaphysical\nrealms the majority of people are enamored of theory and discussion without practical application, but\nthe wise see things differently. Nachiketa has already grasped the fundamental nature of the Self.\nBlissful\nAnalysis shows that the basic motivation of all beings is bliss (ananda) or happiness (sukham), that all\nthe things we strive for are only prized because their acquisition will give rise to joy. In this perspective\nwe see that all beings are in search of the Self, for It alone is of the nature of joy. Once a person grasps\nthis fact\u2013really grasps it\u2013he can only seek for the Self, all else being seen as insignificant.\nIn the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad we find the following relevant exposition:\n\u201dIt is not for the sake of the husband, my beloved, that the husband is dear, but for the sake of\nthe Self.\n\u201dIt is not for the sake of the wife, my beloved, that the wife is dear, but for the sake of the Self.\n\u201dIt is not for the sake of the children, my beloved, that the children are dear, but for the sake of\nthe Self.\n\u201dIt is not for the sake of wealth, my beloved, that wealth is dear, but for the sake of the Self.\n\u201dIt is not for the sake of the Brahmins, my beloved, that the Brahmins are held in reverence, but\nfor the sake of the Self.\n\u201dIt is not for the sake of the Kshatriyas, my beloved, that the Kshatriyas are held in honor, but\nfor the sake of the Self.\n\u201dIt is not for the sake of the higher worlds, my beloved, that the higher worlds are desired, but\nfor the sake of the Self.\n\u201dIt is not for the sake of the gods, my beloved, that the gods are worshiped, but for the sake of\nthe Self.\n\u201dIt is not for the sake of the creatures, my beloved, that the creatures are prized, but for the sake\nof the Self.\n\u201dIt is not for the sake of itself, my beloved, that anything whatever is esteemed, but for the sake\nof the Self.\n\u201dThe Self, Maitreyi, is to be known. Hear about it, reflect upon it, meditate upon it. By knowing\nthe Self, my beloved, through hearing, reflection, and meditation, one comes to know all\nthings.\u201d\nSupreme\nThe Self is supreme\u2013there is nothing that is higher or more desirable than the Self; there is nothing that\nexists beyond the Self. It is supreme because It is Existence Itself. There is no reality other than the\nSelf. We must seek the Self because only the Self can be attained\u2013everything else is a mirage.\nIneffable\nThe Self cannot be defined or evaluated in the terms of relative existence or relative objects\u2013none of\n\nwhich exist outside the Self. Consequently the Self cannot be intellectually understood or even defined.\nNevertheless, the Self can be known in a manner beyond any ordinary knowing, for It can be\nexperienced as both object and subject\u2013a quality unique to Itself.\nAttained by the wise\nThe Self is attainable. Those who at present are ignorant of the Self can become knowers of the Self.\nAlthough only the knowers of the Self are fully worthy of being called wise, we can certainly call those\nwho are seeking the Self also wise. All of us can be the potentially wise if we follow the path to Selfknowledge as outlined in the upanishads, the Gita, and the Yoga Darshan of Patanjali.\nA necessary question\nNachiketa has declared the Self to be Supreme, yet he prudently follows that statement with a question\nto dispel any possibility that he may be misunderstanding Yama\u2019s teaching: Does the Self shine by\nItself, is Light Its essential nature, or does It reflect another\u2019s light? This is a most crucial inquiry. Is the\nSelf Light, or is Its light drawn from a source other than the Self. This is a question that penetrates to\nthe foundations of the cosmos, demanding a clear insight.\nThe sublime answer\n\u201cHim the sun does not illumine, nor the moon, nor the stars, nor the lightning\u2013nor, verily, fires kindled\nupon the earth. He is the one light that gives light to all. He shining, everything shines.\u201d So Yama\nanswers his worthy pupil\u2019s worthy question.\nNothing of heaven or earth illumines the Self or causes It to be radiant. Rather, It is swayamprakash\u2013\nself-luminous. Furthermore, it is the Self that illumines all beings. \u201cHe is the one light that gives light\nto all.\u201d The Self is the essential nature of all sentient beings that \u201cshine\u201d with consciousness. \u201cHe\nshining, everything shines.\u201d\nAll glory to the blissful, supreme, and ineffable Self! All glory to the wise who strive to attain that Self\nas well as the supremely wise who have attained It!\n\nThe Universal Tree\n\u201cThis universe is a tree eternally existing, its root aloft its branches spread below. The pure root of the\ntree is Brahman, the immortal, in whom the three worlds have their being, whom none can transcend,\nwho is verily the Self.\u201d\nLittle needs to be said about this verse, its meaning is quite obvious. We can, however, infer a\nsignificant principle: all things are rooted above in the Supreme Consciousness, in Brahman.\nEverything has Brahman for its essential Being. From this we get the Hermetic principle: As Above, So\nBelow. Applying this principle to our own experience we can come to understand a great deal about the\nhigher\u2013and truer\u2013nature of what is arising and subsiding in our life. Original Christianity, being rooted\nin the upanishadic teachings of Jesus (Isha Nath), taught the same, and that is why in the oldest text of\nChristian hymns, , we find this: \u201cThe likeness of that which is below is that which is above. For\neverything is above, and below there is nothing, but it is believed to be by those in whom there is no\nknowledge.\u201d That is, the ignorant believe that \u201cthings\u201d have an independent existence\u2013an existence that\ncan cease\u2013rather than the truth that they are not only rooted in Brahman, they are an imperishable\nextension of Brahman. \u201cFor in him we live, and move, and have our being\u2026for we are also his\noffspring\u201d as Saint Paul pointed out. \u201cAnd he is before all things, and by him all things consist.\u201d David\n\nsimply sang: \u201cFor with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.\u201d Brahman is the\nultimate state and stage of being. There is no transcending Brahman, for Brahman is truly the Self of\nall.\nFrom this we see the principle only (comparatively) recently discovered by science: that in essence all\nthings are immortal, that there is not a single atomic particle in creation that can go out of existence,\nthat the changes we think are death and birth are only rearrangements of the living energies of which all\nconsist.\nA yogic aspect\nThough yoga is not the subject of this verse, we can extract some important yogic information from it.\nSince we are miniature cosmoses, little universes, our origin is also \u201cabove\u201d in the root ball of the\nbrain, the Thousand-petalled Lotus, the Sahasrara. Therefore, to experience that Source, in meditation\nwe orient our attention toward the head, and we invoke the \u201cpure root\u201d of our being in the form of Om,\nwhich is the same as Brahman.\nThe fearless Source\n\u201cThe whole universe came forth from Brahman and moves in Brahman. Mighty and awful is he, like to\na thunderbolt crashing loud through the heavens. For those who attain him death has no terror.\u201d\n\u201cAwful\u201d is outdated English. \u201cAwesome\u201d is much more correct. (In older forms of English, \u201cawful,\u201d\n\u201chorrible,\u201d and \u201cterrible\u201d all meant awesome, and were positive, but at this point in time they have\nreversed polarity and become negative descriptions.)\nBrahman is Inexorable Power as well as Infinite Consciousness. His presence is like the thunderbolt\nwhose light blinds us to all lesser lights, whose Creative Sound is Om expanding through the\nChidakasha, the Ether of Consciousness, in which all things exist\u2013and of which they consist. Those\nwho unite with this Brahman experience their eternal immortality and become fearless, especially in\nthe face of the mirage called death.\nThe Divine Will\nIn fear of him fire burns, the sun shines, the rains fall, the winds blow, and death kills. (Katha\nUpanishad 2:3:3)\nHere, too, a state of ecstatic awe and wonder is meant. In older English, which Prabhavananda is using,\n\u201cfear\u201d meant to be filled with awe and respect\u2013not to be afraid. So when we read in the older Bible\ntranslations that we should fear God we are actually being told to reverence God.\nIn awesome reverence of Brahman the creation responds to the Supreme Will\u2013for it is itself an\nextension of Brahman, as already said. All that occurs is the movement of Divine Consciousness, is\nresponse to Divine Will. Brahman moves Brahman, and creation manifests and moves onward.\nBrahman ceases to move Brahman, and creation resolves into its potential, causal form and seems to\ncease. At all times it is Brahman reacting upon\u2013and to\u2013Brahman. Even death is only a change of Life.\nThe root of rebirth\n\u201cIf a man fail to attain Brahman before he casts off his body, he must again put on a body in the world\nof created things.\u201d\n\nPerfect knowledge of Brahman resulting from total union of our consciousness with Brahman\u2019s\nConsciousness is the only passport beyond this world\u2013or any worlds of relative existence. Knowledge\nis the root determinant of our rebirth or our freedom from rebirth. This is why most religion is so\nuseless\u2013it deals with \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad,\u201d with \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cerror,\u201d on the tiny level of individual human\nmentalities. The infinite scope of Brahmic Consciousness simply does not come into its purview.\nHuman beings waste lifetimes with such mundane religions that only program them for more and more\nbirths upon this earth. Even their ideas of the afterlife and \u201cheaven\u201d only condition them for more birth\nand bondage. Degenerate Christianity, especially, with its doctrine of physical resurrection and\nimmortality instills material consciousness in its adherents, condemning them to the wheel of perpetual\nbirth and death. Thinking they are \u201ccreatures,\u201d they sink into the quagmire of \u201ccreation.\u201d Actually, they\nimpel themselves into the morass, calling it the will of God. As Jesus said: \u201cIf therefore the light that is\nin thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\u201d If our \u201ctruth\u201d be actually untruth, its blinding\u2013and\nbinding\u2013power is nigh well inescapable.\nThe realm of realization\n\u201cIn one\u2019s own soul Brahman is realized clearly, as if seen in a mirror. In the heaven of Brahma also is\nBrahman realized clearly, as one distinguishes light from darkness. In the world of the fathers he is\nbeheld as in a dream. In the world of angels he appears as if reflected in water.\u201d\nFirst, this verse should put the lie to the absurd claim in contemporary Hinduism that enlightenment is\nimpossible unless the individual is born on earth in a human body. What is the truth is the fact that the\nhighest realm of relativity, the heaven of Brahma (Brahmaloka) is the only one in which the capacity\nfor realizing Brahman is inherent in the form proper to that world. In all other worlds the incarnational\nform is the bar to such realization, for in the minds of the inhabitants of those worlds Brahman appears\nonly as a dream or a reflection in water.\nThe most important fact, though, is the statement that Brahman can be \u201cseen\u201d and experienced in the\nSelf of each one of us\u2013no matter what world we may or may not inhabit. We need not aspire to ascend\nto any other world, thinking that incarnation there is necessary for our spiritual liberation. Not at all.\nWhatever world we may be in, whatever form we may find ourselves incarnate in, we can realize\nBrahman perfectly. Why? Because our Self is one with Brahman. This is why we sometimes read in the\nlore of India about animals that at their death attained moksha (liberation). It is all in the knowing, the\njnana.\n\nHierarchy of Consciousness\nThe senses\n\u201cThe senses have separate origin in their several objects. They may be active, as in the waking state, or\nthey may be inactive, as in sleep. He who knows them to be distinct from the changeless Self grieves\nno more.\u201d\nIf a lost person could somehow be lifted up high and see his surroundings from that perspective, he\ncould easily see his way out of his confusion. In the same way, those who are lost in the jungle of the\nsenses can find their way by heeding the wisdom of the upanishads.\nSense experience is just that\u2013the experiences of the senses themselves. The Self witnesses these\nexperiences and thinks that it is really undergoing them and being affected by them. This produces\ngreat fear and suffering, what to say of the mountain-high heaps of illusions and delusions those\n\nexperiences produce\u2013not in the Self, but in the mind. The Self, however, attributes these things to itself\nand fears and suffers even more. Whether the senses are active or inactive, the potential suffering is\never there. If, however, we can realize that such perceptions are utterly separate from us, from our Self,\nall fear and sorrow cease forever. But we must realize that truth, not just accept it or act as though it is\nso. In other words, we must become yogis, for only yogis realize the truth of the Self and the error of\nthe Not-Self.\nThe hierarchy\n\u201cAbove the senses is the mind. Above the mind is the intellect. Above the intellect is the ego. Above the\nego is the unmanifested seed, the Primal Cause. And verily beyond the unmanifested seed is Brahman,\nthe all-pervading spirit, the unconditioned, knowing whom one attains to freedom and achieves\nimmortality.\u201d\nIt will be good to do some vocabulary building at this point.\nBy \u201csenses\u201d is meant the five organs of perception: ear, skin, eye, tongue, and nose. Often the word\n\u201csenses\u201d really refers to the five sense perceptions.\nBy \u201cmind\u201d is meant the sensory mind; the perceiving faculty that receives the messages of the senses.\n\u201cIntellect\u201d is the faculty of understanding, of reason\u2013the thinking mind.\nThe \u201cego\u201d is the false \u201cI\u201d\u2013egoism or self-conceit. It is also the self-arrogating principle \u201cI\u201d that is\nprojected by the mind rather than the real Self. \u201cEgo\u201d is in manifestation whenever \u201cI\u201d is said or\nclaimed by anything other than the spirit-self.\n\u201cThe unmanifested seed, the Primal Cause\u201d is Prabhavananda\u2019s translation of two terms: Mahat\n(Tattwa) and Avyakta. The Mahat Tattwa, or \u201cGreat Principle\u201d is the first evolute from Prakriti. It is the\nprinciple of Cosmic Intelligence (Buddhi). The Avyakta is the Unmanifest, the primal Prakriti, from\nwhich all things evolve.\nIt is necessary for us to be aware of this hierarchy, for the lesser levels can be controlled from the\nhigher levels, thus saving a great deal of time and frustration.\nThe Supreme, the Source\nBeyond all these various levels that are the machinery of the individual and the cosmos is That which is\nthe Supreme, the Source of all. Regarding That, the upanishad continues: \u201cAnd verily beyond the\nunmanifested seed is Brahman, the all-pervading spirit, the unconditioned, knowing whom one attains\nto freedom and achieves immortality.\u201d\nThe Self and Brahman being one, it is the knowledge of our Self that bestows upon us freedom and\nimmortality.\nTo know the Self\nBut how do we know this Self\u2013not merely hear about It or believe in It, but truly know it by direct\nexperience?\n\u201cNone beholds him with the eyes, for he is without visible form. Yet in the heart is he revealed, through\nself-control and meditation. Those who know him become immortal.\u201d\n\nWhat could be simpler? We enter into the heart, into the Chidakasha (not the physical organ called \u201cthe\nheart\u201d) that is at the core of our being. There the Self is revealed to the disciplined meditator.\nImmortality is the result of such knowing. The upanishad continues with a description of the process\nthat leads to Self-knowledge.\n\u201cWhen all the senses are stilled, when the mind is at rest, when the intellect wavers not\u2013then, say the\nwise, is reached the highest state.\u201d\nThis is extremely, extremely important. Because of the razzamatazz of the Yoga Carnival that has been\nrioting on from the last century, nearly everyone thinks that the highest state involves chills and thrills\nin the form of inner sensory experiences of cataclysmic proportion, including \u201copening of chakras\u201d and\n\u201crising of kundalini.\u201d Notice that the upanishad says nothing like that\u2013nor does the Gita or the Yoga\nSutras. What it does tell us is that the pure consciousness that is Reality is experienced \u201cwhen all the\nsenses are stilled, when the mind is at rest, when the intellect wavers not.\u201d That, and that alone, is the\nhighest state which in time becomes permanent and is itself liberation.\nYoga\nObviously much that is called yoga is not yoga at all. This is brought out by the next verse: \u201cThis calm\nof the senses and the mind has been defined as yoga. He who attains it is freed from delusion. In one\nnot freed from delusion this calm is uncertain, unreal: it comes and goes.\u201d\nThe state of calm, or steadiness (sthiram) in awareness of awareness itself, is yoga. This frees us from\ndelusion because it makes us aware of our true nature as the Self. In those who have not attained\nperfection this state comes and goes. The upanishad tells us this so we will not be foolish enough to\nthink that experiencing it once or even a few times is enough and wrongly think we are enlightened.\n(People claim enlightenment on the basis of much less.) We must practice diligently to become\npermanently established in it.\nAlthough I have told about Lahiri Mahashaya\u2019s teaching on the subject of this state\u2013which he called\nsthirattwa\u2013in the Gita commentary, I would like to repeat it here.\nYogiraj Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya continually expounded the idea that the goal of yoga is to be\nestablished in sthirattwa, in perfect tranquility.\n\u201cA group of spiritual leaders from Calcutta once conspired against Lahiri Mahasay. They invited him to\njoin in an evening discussion on spiritual matters. Lahiri Mahasay accepted the invitation and\naccordingly attended the meeting.\n\u201cThe conspirators had well prepared themselves to trap Lahiri Mahasay. For example, if Lahiri\nMahasay were to express his preference for a particular deity, or Istadev, \u2018desired Lord,\u2019 then a\nparticular leader would find exception to that choice.\n\u201cIn fact, each member of the group selected a particular Devata, \u2018deity\u2019 such as Lord Vishnu, Lord\nKrishna, Lord Siva, the Goddess Kali (the Divine Mother) and prepared to debate and challenge Lahiri\nMahasay\u2019s choice.\n\u201cAs soon as Lahiri Mahasay arrived, he was received in the traditional manner and shown proper\ncourtesy. After a while one of the members of the group asked Lahiri Mahasay, \u2018Upon which deity do\nyou meditate?\u2019\n\u201cLahiri Mahasay looked at him but did not reply. Then another gentleman asked him, \u2018Who is your\n\nIstadev, \u201cdesired deity?\u201d\u2019 Lahiri Mahasay turned his head towards him and looked at him in the same\nway, while keeping his peace.\n\u201cFinally, a third gentleman asked him, \u2018Can you tell us upon which deity usually you meditate?\u2019\n\u201cLahiri Mahasay faced him and said very gently, \u2018I meditate on Sthirattva (Tranquility).\u2019\n\u201cThe gentleman replied that he did not understand what was meant by this. Lahiri Mahasay continued\nto observe silence. After some time, another gentleman asked him, \u2018Could you please explain this? I do\nnot understand exactly what you are saying.\u2019\n\u201cLahiri Mahasay, as before, continued to maintain silence. Another gentleman asked, \u2018Can you\nenlighten me as to what you mean by that? I do not understand at all!\u2019 Lahiri Baba told him, \u2018You will\nnot be able to understand, and also I will not be able to make you understand (realize) through words.\u2019\n\u201cThe group was at a loss. All of their preparation and conniving had come to naught. Only silence\nprevailed. All kept silent.\n\u201cAfter a long time Lahiri Mahasay got up and silently prepared to leave the meeting. All showed him\nthe traditional courtesy as he left.\u201d\nAs Paramhansa Yogananda, who made Lahiri Mahashaya known in the West, often said: \u201cHe who\nknows, knows\u2013none else knows.\u201d\nHow can Brahman be known?\n\u201cBrahman words cannot reveal, mind cannot reach, eyes cannot see. How then, save through those who\nknow him, can he be known?\u201d\nBrahman can only be truly known by direct experience in meditation. This verse is not speaking of that\nultimate knowing, but of the \u201cknowing about\u201d Brahman so we can be stimulated to seek Brahman.\nEmpty words and intellectual ponderings cannot bring about this knowing, nor can our mind and\nsenses. But those who know of Brahman\u2013even imperfectly\u2013possess a spiritual power in their presence\nand in their words which convey an intuitive glimmer of the reality of Brahman. That glimmer, entering\ninto our hearts through contact with them, causes our inmost awareness to awaken, arise, and respond,\nand seek the full realization of Brahman for ourselves. This is why the company of sadhakas is\nessential for the questing soul. It is like one candle lighting another.\nThe two selves\n\u201cThere are two selves, the apparent self and the real Self. Of these it is the real Self, and he alone, who\nmust be felt as truly existing. To the man who has felt him as truly existing he reveals his innermost\nnature.\u201d\nIt is common in Western metaphysical thought to speak of the \u201clower self\u201d that is not truly the Self, but\nthe lesser aspects of human existence, and the \u201chigher self\u201d that is the real Self. We must distinguish\nbetween the two, and this impossible without enough inner development making possible the intuition\nof the Self, even if It is not directly known. One who has this intuition, if intelligent, will then begin to\nseek to know the Self, to become a yogi in some manner. To such a one who perseveres, the Self will\nbe revealed in Its fulness. As Swami Gambhirananda renders the first part of this verse: \u201cThe Self is to\nbe realized as existing, and then as It really is.\u201d This realization is what is meant by distinguishing\nbetween the unreal and the Real.\n\nFrom Mortality to Immortality\n\u201cLead me from death to immortality\u201d is part of a prayer at the beginning of the Brihadaranyaka\nUpanishad. In this final part of the Katha Upanishad we are given practical understanding of the way in\nwhich immortality is gained.\n\u201cThe mortal in whose heart desire is dead becomes immortal. The mortal in whose heart the knots of\nignorance are untied becomes immortal. These are the highest truths taught in the scriptures.\u201d\nWhen desire dies, when ignorance drops away, immortality is revealed. Practically speaking, we\n\u201cbecome\u201d immortal, but in reality we have always been immortal. Yet, like a millionaire who thinks he\nis a pauper, our immortality is of little meaning to us until we come to realize and experience it.\nFurthermore, the upanishad tells us that in essence this truth is the only spiritual teaching there is\u2013not\njust \u201cthe highest truths\u201d as Prabhavananda renders it.. Shankara says that this is the only teaching in all\nthe upanishads, however varying the approaches may be. The aspirant must not lose himself in\nphilosophical byways, including those set forth in mountains of books on Yoga and Vedanta. He must\nkeep his vision clear and focused by understanding that liberation is the only \u201cpoint\u201d the upanishads\never make.\nAttaining immortality\nIt is easy to tell ourselves to rid ourselves of desire and ignorance, but how is that to be done, especially\nsince we have been in the grip of these two ogres for creation cycles? The upanishad gives us the yogic\nkey to rising above desire and ignorance into immortality:\n\u201cRadiating from the lotus of the heart there are a hundred and one nerves. One of these ascends toward\nthe thousand-petaled lotus in the brain. If, when a man comes to die, his vital force passes upward and\nout through this nerve, he attains immortality; but if his vital force passes out through another nerve, he\ngoes to one or another plane of mortal existence and remains subject to birth and death.\u201d\nIt is noteworthy that this comes at the very end of the upanishad. Yogananda used to say: \u201cYoga is the\nbeginning of the end.\u201d So it is appropriate that after all the philosophical exposition the yoga teaching\nshould be given.\nBy \u201cheart\u201d is meant the hub\u2013located in the midst of the upper trunk of the body\u2013of subtle passages\nknown as nadis (here translated \u201cnerves\u201d) through which the life force (prana) circulates throughout the\ngross and subtle bodies, just as the blood circulates from the heart through the veins of the physical\nbody. One hundred of these nadis direct the life force to the life processes of the bodies and are the\nforces of embodiment. One, unique, nadi, however, rises directly upward from the heart-hub into the\nhead. (This nadi rises from the heart directly into the head\u2013it is not the passage in the midst of the\nspine.) If at the time of death the departing spirit leaves through that channel, he gains immortality. But\nif his consciousness attaches itself to any of the hundred other nadis he will be impelled into the subtle\nworlds that lead inexorably back to incarnation in relativity.\nIn every meditation, by intoning Om in time with the breath we activate this channel, causing the life\nforce to spontaneously and effortlessly, flow upward into the thousand-petalled lotus in the head toward\nthe divine radiance that shines above and upon the upper levels of the brain-lotus. That Divine Light is\nthe essence of Om, the Life-Giving Word, the Pranava. Then at the end of life, having prepared himself\nby this practice, sitting in meditation the yogi ascends upward from the body into the realm of\n\nimmortality.\nThe Supreme Person\nWho is liberated in this manner? In conclusion to his teaching, Yama tells Nachiketa:\n\u201cThe Supreme Person, of the size of a thumb, the innermost Self, dwells forever in the heart of all\nbeings. As one draws the pith from a reed, so must the aspirant after truth, with great perseverance,\nseparate the Self from the body. Know the Self to be pure and immortal\u2013yea, pure and immortal!\u201d\nIf the Self is seen, immaterial as it is, it will appear as an oval light, in the shape of a human thumb.\n(The shape is also that of a Shiva Linga, which is a symbol of the Self.) Those who have seen this are\nunanimous in describing it in the manner of the upanishad. In my early teens I met a Christian minister\nwho described the death of his twin brother. He said that at the moment of death his brother\u2019s mouth\nopened, and as he exhaled for the final time, a white light shaped like a thumb emerged from his mouth\nand passed from the room.\nIt is through meditation, as I have described it, that we daily work on the separation of the Self from the\nbody which will finally occur at the time of death. Not that we leave our body in meditation, but we\nbegin conditioning all our bodies so they will not hold on to us at the final moments. As the fully\nripened kernel of a nut pulls away from the shell so that when it is cracked the kernel comes out in full\nseparation, so will it be with our Self in relation to the body. Sri Ramakrishna described it as being like\nthe release of a fish back into the river.\nMay these final words of Yama echo within us: \u201cKnow the Self to be pure and immortal\u2013yea, pure and\nimmortal!\u201d\nNachiketa\u2013and us\nNow the upanishadic sage gives us a final assurance:\n\u201cNachiketa, having learned from the god this knowledge and the whole process of yoga, was freed\nfrom impurities and from death, and was united with Brahman. Thus will it be with another also if he\nknow the innermost Self.\u201d\nEnd of Katha Commentary",
    "Prasna": "\n\nPrasna Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Gambhirananda\nPublished by Advaita Ashram, Kolkatta\nOm ! O gods, may we hear auspicious words with the ears;\nWhile engaged in sacrifices,\nMay we see auspicious things with the eyes;\nWhile praising the gods with steady limbs,\nMay we enjoy a life that is beneficial to the gods.\nMay Indra of ancient fame be auspicious to us;\nMay the supremely rich (or all-knowing) Pusa (god of the earth)\nBe propitious to us;\nMay Garuda, the destroyer of evil,\nBe well disposed towards us;\nMay Brihaspati ensure our welfare.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nI-1: Sukesa, son of Bharadvaja; Satyakama, so of Sibi; the grandson of Surya, born of the family of\nGarga; Kausalya, so of Asvala; a scion of the line of Bhrigu, born in Vidarbha; and Kabandhi,\ndescendant of Katya \u2013 all these, who were devoted to (the inferior) Brahman, engaged in realising (the\ninferior) Brahman, and intent on a search of the supreme Brahman, approached with faggots in hand,\nthe venerable Pippalada with the belief, \u201cThis one will certainly tell us all about It.\u201d\nI-2: To them the seer said, \u201cLive (here) again for a year in a fitting manner, with control over the senses\nand with brahmacharya and faith. Then put questions as you please. If we know, we shall explain all\nyour questions.\u201d\nI-3: After that Kabandhi, descendant of Katya, having approached (him) asked, \u201cVenerable sir, from\nwhat indeed are all these beings born ?\u201d\nI-4: To him he said: The Lord of all creatures became desirous of progeny. He deliberated on (past\nVedic) knowledge. Having brooded on that knowledge, He created a couple \u2013 food and Prana \u2013 under\nthe idea, \u201cThese two will produce creatures for me in multifarious ways.\u201d\nI-5: The sun is verily Prana; and food is verily the moon. Whatever is gross or subtle is but food. The\n\ngross, as distinguished from that (subtle), is certainly food (of the subtle).\nI-6: Now then, the fact that the sun, while rising, enters into the eastern direction, thereby it absorbs\ninto its rays all the creatures in the east. That it enters into the south, that it enters into the west, that it\nenters into the north, that it reaches the nadir and the zenith, that it enters the intermediate points of the\nzodiac, that it illumines all, thereby it absorbs all living things into its rays.\nI-7: That very one rises up who is Prana and fire, who is identified with all creatures, and who is\npossessed of all forms. This very one, that has been referred to, is spoken of by the mantra:\nI-8: (The realisers of Brahman) knew the one that is possessed of all forms, full of rays, endowed with\nillumination, the resort of all, the single light (of all), and the radiator of heat. It is the sun that rises \u2013\nthe sun that possesses a thousand rays, exists in a hundred forms and is the life of all creatures.\nI-9: The year is verily the Lord of creatures. Of Him there are two Courses, the Southern and the\nNorthern. As to that, those, who follow, in that way, the sacrifices and public good etc., that are\nproducts of action, conquer the very world of the moon. It is they who come back. (Since this is so),\nhence these seers of heaven, who are desirous of progeny, attain the Southern Course. That which is the\nCourse of the Manes is verily food.\nI-10: Again, by searching for the Self through the control of the senses, brahmacharya, faith and\nmeditation, they conquer the sun (by proceeding) along the Northern Course. This is the resort of all\nthat lives; this is indestructible; this is fearless; this is the highest goal, for from this they do not come\nback. This is unrealisable (to the ignorant). Pertaining to this here is a verse:\nI-11: Some talk of (this sun) as possessed of five feet, as the father, as constituted by twelve limbs, and\nas full of water in the high place above the sky. But there are these others who call him the omniscient\nand say that on him, as possessed of seven wheels and six spokes, is fixed (the whole universe).\nI-12: The month verily is the Lord of all creatures. The dark fortnight is His food, and the bright His\nPrana. Therefore these seers perform the sacrifices in the bright fortnight. The others perform it in the\nother.\nI-13: Day and night are verily the Lord of all creatures. Day is surely His Prana and night is certainly\nthe food. Those who indulge in passion in the day, waste away Prana. That they give play to passion at\nnight is as good as celibacy.\nI-14: Food is nothing but the Lord of all creatures. From that indeed issues that human seed. From that\nare born all these beings.\nI-15: This being so, those who undertake the well-known vow of the Lord of all creatures, beget both\nsons and daughters. For them alone is this world of the moon in whom there are the vows and\ncontinence, and in whom is found for ever avoidance of falsehood.\nI-16: For them is that taintless world of Brahman, in whom there is no crookedness no falsehood, and\nno dissimulation.\nII-1: Next a scion of the line of Bhrigu, born in Vidarbha, asked him, \u201cSir, how many in fact are the\ndeities that sustain a creature ? Which among them exhibit this glory ? Which again is the chief among\nthem ?\u201d\nII-2: To him he said: Space in fact is this deity, as also are air, fire, water, earth, the organ of speech,\nmind, eye and ear. Exhibiting their glory they say, \u201cUnquestionably it is we who hold together this\nbody by not allowing it to disintegrate.\u201d\nII-3: To them the chief Prana said, \u201cDo not be deluded. It is I who do not allow it to disintegrate by\nsustaining it by dividing myself fivefold.\u201d They remained incredulous.\nII-4: He appeared to be rising up (from the body) out of indignation. As He ascended, all the others,\ntoo, ascended immediately; and when He remained quite, all others, too, remained in position. Just as\nin the world, all the bee take to flight in accordance as the king of the bees takes to his wings, and they\nsettle down as he does so, similarly, did speech, mind, eye, ear, etc., behave. Becoming delighted, they\n(began to) praise Prana.\n\nII-5: This one (i.e. Prana) burns as fire, this one is the sun, this one is cloud, this one is Indra and air,\nthis one is the earth and food. This god is the gross and the subtle, as well as that which is nectar.\nII-6: Like spokes on the hub of a chariot wheel, are fixed on Prana all things \u2013 riks, yajus, samas,\nsacrifice, Kshatriya and Brahmana.\nII-7: It is you who move about in the womb as the Lord of creation, and it is you who take birth after\nthe image of the parents. O Prana, it is for you, who reside with the organs, that all these creatures carry\npresents.\nII-8: You are the best transmitter (of libation) to the celestials. You are the food-offering to the Manes\nthat precedes other offerings. You are the right conduct of the organs that constitute the essence of the\nbody and are known as the Atharvas.\nII-9: O Prana, you are Indra. Through your valour you are Rudra; and you are the preserver on all sides.\nYou move in the sky \u2013 you are the sun, the Lord of all luminaries.\nII-10: O Prana, when you pour down (as rain), then these creatures of yours continue to be in a happy\nmood under the belief, \u201cFood will be produced to our hearts\u2019 content.\u201d\nII-11: O Prana, you are unpurified, you are the fire Ekarsi, (you are) the eater, and you are the lord of\nall that exists. We are the givers of (your) food. O Matarisva, you are our father.\nII-12: Make calm that aspect of yours that is lodged in speech, that which is in the ear, that which is in\nthe eye, and that which permeates the mind. Do not rise up.\nII-13: All this (in this world), as also all that is in heaven is under the control of Prana. Protect us just as\na mother does her sons, and ordain for us splendour and intelligence.\nIII-1: Then Kausalya, son of Asvala, asked him, \u201cO venerable sir, from where is this Prana born ? How\ndoes He come into this body ? How again does He dwell by dividing Himself ? How does he depart ?\nHow does He support the external things and how the physical ?\u201d\nIII-2: To him he said: You are putting super-normal questions, since you are pre-eminently a knower of\nBrahman. Hence I speak to you.\nIII-3: From the Self is born this Prana. Just as there can be shadow when a man is there, so this Prana is\nfixed on the self. He comes to this body owing to the actions of the mind.\nIII-4: As it is the king alone who employs the officers saying, \u201cRule over these villages, and those\nones\u201d, just so Prana engages the other organs separately.\nIII-5: He places Apana in the two lower apertures. Prana Himself, issuing out of the mouth and nostrils,\nresides in the eyes and ears. In the middle, however, is Samana, for this one distributes equally all this\nfood that is eaten. From that issue out these seven flames.\nIII-6: This self (i.e. the subtle body) is surely in the heart. There are a hundred and one of the (chief)\nnerves. Each of them has a hundred (division). Each branch is divided into seventy-two thousand subbranches. Among them moves Vyana.\nIII-7: Now then Udana, when it is in its upward trend, leads to a virtuous world as a result of virtue, to\na sinful world as a result of sin and to the human world as a result of both.\nIII-8: The sun is indeed the external Prana. It rises up favouring this Prana in the eye. That deity, that is\nin the earth, favours by attracting Apana in a human being. The space (i.e. air), that is within, is\nSamana. The (common) air is Vyana.\nIII-9: That which if well known as luminosity, is Udana. Therefore, one who gets his light\nextinguished, attains rebirth together with the organs that enter into (his) mind.\nIII-10: Together with whatever thought he had (at the time of death), he enters into Prana. Prana, in\ncombination with Udana and in association with the soul, leads him to the world desired by him.\nIII-11: The line of progeny of any man of knowledge who knows Prana thus sustains no break. He\nbecomes immortal. Pertaining to this there occurs this mantra.\nIII-12: Having known the origin, coming, lodgement and fivefold overlordship and the physical\nexistence of Prana, one achieves immortality. Having known, one achieves immortality.\n\nIV-1: Then the grandson of Surya, born of the family of Garga, asked him, \u201cO adorable sir, which are\nthe organs that go to sleep in this person ? Which keep awake in him ? Which is the deity who\nexperiences dream ? To whom occurs this happiness ? In whom do all get merged?\nIV-2: To him he said, O Gargya, just as all the rays of the setting sun become unified in this orb of light,\nand they disperse from the sun as it rises up again, similarly all that becomes unified in the high deity,\nthe mind. Hence this person does not then hear, does not see, does not smell, does not taste, does not\ntouch, does not speak, does not grasp, does not enjoy, does not eject, does not move. People say, \u201cHe is\nsleeping.\u201d\nIV-3: It is the fires (i.e. the functions resembling fire) of Prana that really keep awake in this city of the\nbody. That which is this Apana really resembles the Garhapatya fire, Vyana resembles the fire,\nAnvaharyapacana. Since the Ahavaniya fire is obtained from Garhapatya, which is the former\u2019s source\nof extraction, therefore Prana conforms to Ahavaniya (because of its issuing out of Apana).\nIV-4: Samana is the priest called Hota, because it strikes a balance between exhalation and inhalation\nwhich are but (comparable to) two oblations. The mind is verily the sacrificer. The desired fruit Udana,\nwhich leads this sacrificer every day to Brahman.\nIV-5: In this dream state this deity (i.e. the mind) experiences greatness. Whatever was seen, it sees\nagain; whatever was heard, it hears again; whatever was perceived in the different places and\ndirections, it experiences again and again; it perceives all by becoming all that was seen or not seen,\nheard or not heard, perceived or not perceived, and whatever is real or unreal.\nIV-6: When that deity, (the mind), becomes overwhelmed by (solar) rays (called bile), then in this state\nthe deity does not see dreams. Then, all that time, there occurs this kind of happiness in this body.\nIV-7: To illustrate the point: As the birds, O good looking one, proceed towards the tree that provides\nlodging, just so all these proceed to the supreme Self.\nIV-8: Earth and the rudiment of earth, water and the rudiment of water, fire and the rudiment of fire,\nspace and the rudiment of space, the organ and object of vision, the organ and object of hearing, the\norgan and object of smell, the organ and object of taste, the organ and object of touch, the organ and\ncontent of speech, the hands and the object grasped, sex and enjoyment, the organ of excretion and the\nexcreta, the feet and the space trodden, the mind and the content of thought, understanding and the\ncontent of understanding, egoism and the content of egoism, awareness and the content of awareness,\nthe shining skin and the object revealed by that, Prana and all that has to be held by Prana.\nIV-9: And this one is the seer, feeler, hearer, smeller, taster, thinker, ascertainer, doer \u2013 the Purusha\n(pervading the body and senses), that is a knower by nature. This becomes wholly established in the\nsupreme, immutable Self.\nIV-10: He who realises that shadowless, bodiless, colourless, pure, Immutable attains the supreme\nImmutable Itself. O amiable one, he, again, who realises, becomes omniscient and all. Illustrative of\nthis there occurs this verse:\nIV-11: O amiable one, he becomes all-knowing and enters into all, who knows that Immutable wherein\nmerges the cognising Self \u2013 (the Purusha who is naturally a knower) \u2013 as also do the organs and the\nelements together with all the deities.\nV-1: Next, Satyakama, son of Sibi, asked him, \u201cO venerable sir, which world does he really win\nthereby, who among men, intently meditates on Om in that wonderful way till death ?\u201d To him he said:\nV-2: O Satyakama, this very Brahman, that is (known as) the inferior and superior, is but this Om.\nTherefore the illumined soul attains either of the two through this one means alone.\nV-3: Should he meditate on Om as consisting of one letter he becomes enlightened even by that and\nattains a human birth on the earth. The Rik mantras lead him to the human birth. Being endued there\nwith self-control, continence, and faith he experiences greatness.\nV-4: Now gain, if he meditates on Om with the help of the second letter, he becomes identified with the\n\nmind. By the Yajur mantras he is lifted to the intermediate space, the world of the Moon. Having\nexperienced greatness in the lunar world, he turns round again.\nV-5: Again, any one who meditates on the supreme Purusha with the help of this very syllable Om, as\npossessed of three letters, becomes unified in the Sun, consisting of light. As a snake becomes freed\nfrom its Slough, exactly in a similar way, he becomes freed from sin, and he is lifted up to the world of\nBrahma (Hiranyagarbha) by the Sama mantras. From this total mass of creatures (that Hiranyagarbha\nis) he sees the supreme Purusha that penetrates every being and is higher than the higher One (viz.\nHiranyagarbha). Bearing on this, there occur two verses:\nV-6: The three letters (by themselves) are within the range of death. But if they are closely joined, one\nto another, are not divergently applied to different objects, and are applied to the three courses of action\n\u2013 external, internal and intermediate \u2013 that are properly resorted to, then the man of enlightenment does\nnot shake (i.e. remains undisturbed).\nV-7: The intelligent know this world that is attainable by the Rik mantras, the intermediate space\nachievable by the Yajur mantras, and that which is reached by the Sama mantras. The enlightened man\nattains that (threefold) world through Om alone; and through Om as an aid, he reaches that also which\nis the supreme Reality that is quiet and beyond old age, death and fear.\nVI-1: Then Sukesa, son of Bharadvaja, asked him, \u201cVenerable sir, Hiranyanabha, a prince of Kosala,\napproached me and put this question, \u2018Bharadvaja, do you know the Purusha possessed of sixteen limbs\n?\u2019 To that prince I said, \u2018I do not know him. Had I known him why should I not have told you ? Anyone\nwho utters a falsehood dries up root and all. Therefore I cannot afford to utter a falsehood. Silently he\nwent away riding on the chariot. Of that Purusha I ask you, \u2018Where does He exist ?\u2019\u201d\nVI-2: To him he (Pippalada) said: O amiable one, here itself inside the body is that Purusha in whom\noriginate these sixteen digits (or limbs).\nVI-3: He deliberated: \u201cAs a result of whose departure shall I rise up ? And as a result of whose\ncontinuance shall I remain established ?\u201d\nVI-4: He created Prana; from Prana (He created) faith, space, air, fire, water, earth, organs, mind, food;\nfrom food (He created) vigour, self-control, mantras, rites, worlds and name in the worlds.\nVI-5: The illustration is this: Just as these flowing rivers that have the sea as their goal, get absorbed\nafter reaching the sea, and their names and forms are destroyed, and they are called merely the sea, so\nalso these sixteen parts (i.e. constituents) of the all-seeing Purusha, that have Purusha as their goal,\ndisappear on reaching Purusha, when their names and forms are destroyed and they are simply called\nPurusha. Such a man of realisation becomes free from the parts and is immortal. On this point there\noccurs this verse:\nVI-6: You should know that Purusha who is worthy to be known and in whom are transfixed the parts\nlike spokes in the nave of a chariot wheel, so that death may not afflict you anywhere.\nVI-7: To them he said, \u201cI know this supreme Brahman thus far only. Beyond this there is nothing.\u201d\nVI-8: While worshipping him they said, \u201cYou indeed are our father who have ferried us across\nnescience to the other shore. Salutation to the great seers. Salutation to the great seers.\u201d\nOm ! O gods, may we hear auspicious words with the ears;\nWhile engaged in sacrifices,\nMay we see auspicious things with the eyes;\nWhile praising the gods with steady limbs,\nMay we enjoy a life that is beneficial to the gods.\nMay Indra of ancient fame be auspicious to us;\nMay the supremely rich (or all-knowing) Pusa (god of the earth)\nBe propitious to us;\nMay Garuda, the destroyer of evil,\n\nBe well disposed towards us;\nMay Brihaspati ensure our welfare.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Prasnopanishad, included in the Atharva-Veda.\n\nPrashna Upanishad Commentary\nCommentary on the Prashna Upanishad\u2013by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\nThe Right Beginning\nThis upanishad, the Prashna Upanishad, is called The Question (Prashna) Upanishad because of its\nformat of question and answer throughout. But the first two verses set the stage for the reader, and also\nindicate what is needed for a successful quest after the knowledge of Brahman\u2013at least that which can\nbe taught and comprehended intellectually.\nThe seekers\n\u201cSukesha, Satyakama, Gargya, Kousalya, Bhargava, and Kabandhi, devotees and seekers after the truth\nof the supreme Brahman, with faith and humility approached the sage Pippalada.\u201d\nBecause it would have no meaning for Western readers, Swami Prabhavananda has omitted the\nparentage and family ties of these six seekers. Nevertheless, their listing is significant, for a yogi must\nhave psychological \u201cancestors\u201d in the form of inner spiritual qualities that will help him to persevere in\nyoga practice. Besides a good inner background, the upanishad cites four good traits needed by every\naspirant to higher evolution: devotion in the sense of dedication, desire to know God, faith, and\nhumility.\nDedication is needful, for it keeps us steady when we encounter snags and obstacles in our path, and it\nkeeps us plodding along in times of dryness and uncertainty. It ensures that we will persevere in our\nefforts to attain spiritual heights.\nIt is easy to forget why we originally took up spiritual life and wander into byways of lesser endeavor.\nThis is why many become tangled up in externalities of religion, wrangling over philosophical\nconcepts, and even becoming enamored of control over others under the pretence of religious\ndiscipline. As Jesus told Martha: \u201cThou art careful and troubled about many things: but one thing is\nneedful\u201d. Because of this the upanishad tells us that these wise seekers were intent on a single thing:\nthe truth of the Supreme Brahman. We should aspire to\u2013and settle for\u2013nothing less.\nFaith in the form of conviction of the reality of spiritual matters is also a necessity, for who can\n\npersevere in search of something about which they have no inner assurance? We need the convictionfaith that God is real and can be known. Saint Paul encapsulated the whole matter when he wrote: \u201cHe\nthat cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.\u201d\nAn interior knowing that God is real and can be experienced will give us the strength we need to keep\non to the Goal.\nHumility in the sense of a willingness to listen and learn, aware of all we do not know, is essential.\nRespect is also implied here. In the East they overdo it to the point of groveling and mindless\nacceptance, while in the West the casual, one-on-one attitude is exaggerated into overfamiliarity and\nvirtual disrespect. It is amazing how very wise Western ignoramuses consider themselves. As someone\nonce wrote: \u201cThe trouble with ignorance is that it gains confidence as it goes along.\u201d\nThe seeker must be keenly aware that he lacks something\u2013a great deal, in fact\u2013with emphasis on need.\nHe must not forget that seeking implies needing and asking. Those who strut up to a teacher as though\nthey are visiting the zoo will\u2013and should\u2013receive nothing. On the other hand, the seeker should not\ngrovel or be unthinkingly accepting. The student should carefully examine the prospective teacher to\nsee if he is qualified and worth listening to. The worthy teacher will equally carefully examine the\nprospective student to see if he has the right attitude and is capable of learning and applying what is\nlearned. A dud on either end ruins the equation.\nThe requisites\n\u201cSaid the sage: \u2018Practice austerity, continence, faith for a year; then ask what questions you wish. If I\ncan, I will answer.\u2019\u201d Now this is the way of a real teacher of Brahmajnana. He tells what they must do\nand what he will then do.\nThere is a story told in India of a young man who came to a guru and asked to learn from him. The\nguru told him what he would have to do to qualify himself. Not very happy with the list, he asked what\nthe guru would do in all that time. When told that the guru would teach him occasionally, as he would\ndeem appropriate, the would-be disciple remarked: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make me a guru, instead; that\nsounds a lot easier.\u201d Yes, indeed.\nMany approach a teacher while living in a fantasy world projected by their over-confident ego. If the\nteacher is as false as they and conforms to the fantasy, they are happy. But if the teacher is real, and\ndares to speak to them realistically about the means and the goal, they are most displeased. We are not\nof this type, hopefully, so let us look at the requirements Pippalada sets forth.\n1) Spiritual discipline (tapasya), most particularly the practice of meditation. 2) Control of the senses\n(brahmacharya), especially continence. 3) Faith in the teaching of the upanishadic sages regarding the\nSupreme Goal, the possibility of attaining It, and their assertions as to the means of attainment.\nThese are absolute necessities\u2013and they must be unwaveringly practiced and held to for a significant\nlength of time before the seeker can possibly be mentally and spiritually capable of comprehending the\nwisdom of the sages. First the students must be qualified, otherwise a qualified teacher will be of no\nuse to them at all.\nThe teacher\n\u201cThen ask what questions you wish. If I can, I will answer.\u201d This promise contains two major qualities\nof an authentic spiritual teacher.\nFirst, the teacher will accept and consider whatever the student asks. He will not shrug off even the\n\nsilliest inquiry, nor will he reject the student\u2019s questioning of the veracity or value of what he believes\nor teaches. This is one of the most glorious characteristics of Sanatana Dharma\u2013it has no fear of honest\ninquiry and honest doubt. Not being insecure, the teacher of Dharma is not disturbed by questioning or\nstatements of disbelief.\nA friend of mine told me that she quit being a Christian when, as a teenager, she dared to express\ndoubts to her parish priest. He raved at her and threatened hell, saying that to even ask for explanation\nof \u201cthe mysteries\u201d was a sin and an insult to God. So she walked away and never went back. Over sixty\nyears (!) later she came into the orbit of Sanatana Dharma, asked all her questions, and received\nanswers that restored her faith in Jesus\u2013but not in Churchianity. In true Dharma we find the key to\nunderstanding the teachings of all the Masters of all the ages. I have found throughout nearly fifty years\nthat Sanatana Dharma illumines their words to a degree that their professed followers and \u201cisms\u201d\ncannot even dream of.\nThose who would follow Jesus and Buddha, need to seek out the same source from which they drew\ntheir teachings: Sanatana Dharma. Then, like them, they can become Sanatana Dharmis and thereby\nbecome their true disciples. Sanatana Dharma expands their horizons to embrace all truth wherever it\nmay be found. It is true that of late there have arisen bigots in India who speak as hatefully and\nignorantly about other religions as those religions speak of others. But they are not Sanatana Dharmis,\nfor the Dharma has no place for hate, ignorance, and sectarianism. As Jesus said, the truth sets you free.\nSecond, a worthy teacher will acknowledge that he cannot answer some questions. This is because\nsome things are simply beyond verbal expression. Further, no true teacher is egotistical, therefore he\nwill readily admit it if he feels it is beyond his capacity to explain something\u2013just as we find that\nsometimes we cannot find a word to express what we know well inwardly. And most of all, a good\nteacher is willing to admit when he just does not know the answer to something. Only a fool thinks he\nis omniscient, and only a fake wants others to think he is.\nIn my encounters with teachers, the person nearest to being all-knowing was Swami Sivananda, and he\nwas known to reply: \u201cI really don\u2019t know\u201d to certain questions. But he certainly knew the way to God,\nas the lives of his disciples attest. (Sometimes a Master does not know the answer to a question because\nit is trivial and foolish, and his mind is free from triviality and foolishness.)\nSo we have seen the two elements needed for a meaningful exchange of questions and answers: worthy\nquestioners and worthy answerers.\n\nThe Father and Mother of All\nby Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\u201cAfter a year Kabandhi approached the teacher and asked: \u2018Sir, how did the creatures come into\nbeing?\u2019\u201d This is the question of any reflective person. There are many answers to it, but this upanishad\ngoes to the root of relative existence as Pippalada replies:\n\u201c\u2018The Lord of beings,\u2019 replied the sage, \u2018meditated and produced Prana, the primal energy, and Rayi,\nthe giver of form, desiring that they, male and female, should in manifold ways produce creatures for\nhim.\u2019\u201d\nPrajapati\u2013Brahma \u201cThe Lord of Creation\u201d\u2013did not create the world in the manner understood in the\nWest, rather, he manifested it from the primal energy known as Prakriti by the power of his meditation.\nThis was no new occurrence, for the projection and withdrawal of the cosmos in precise cycles has\n\nbeen going on from eternity. Just as wind moving over water causes it to take on a multitude of waveforms, so does the creative thought of Brahma. In Genesis we are told: \u201cIn the beginning God created\nthe heaven and the earth. And\u2026darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved\nupon the face of the waters.\u201d The Breath (Ruach) of God, the creative thought of God, moved on the\ncausal \u201cwaters\u201d and the cosmos began to manifest.\nCreation begins and moves on in an exact order, so the first thing that occurred was the manifestation\nof Prana and Rayi\u2013internal Life and the outer Energy that manifests as form. There are many levels of\nmanifestation, and Pippalada is only speaking of the lower worlds which are manifested by Brahma.\nThe lower worlds mirror the higher ones, and in Christian terminology this coming forth of Prana and\nRayi are equivalent to the coming forth of the Son and the Holy Spirit from the Transcendent Absolute\u2013\nthe Father\u2013at the very highest level of manifestation.\nPrana and Rayi are the two poles of manifesting energy\u2013positive and negative, male and female. This\nduality is at the heart of all that presently exists, and without it everything dissolves. Prana and Rayi are\nthe \u201cparents\u201d of all things. Creation is their perpetual interaction. As Yogananda wrote in one of his\nchants: \u201cSpirit and Nature dancing together!\u201d All \u201ccreatures\u201d\u2013all that exist in relativity\u2013have sprung\nfrom Prana and Rayi. This is why all religions have intuited the existence of a primeval Father and\nMother of All.\nSun and Moon\nEven more, nearly all religions have had some idea about the original Father and Mother being the sun\nand moon respectively.\n\u201cPrana, the primal energy, is the sun; and Rayi, the form-giving substance, is the moon. Be it known\nthat all this universe, that which is gross and that which is subtle, is one with Rayi. Therefore is Rayi\nomnipresent. In like manner is the universe one with Prana.\u201d Nothing can exist without duality\u2013Prana\nand Rayi\u2013at the root of their manifestation, and they are still being maintained by them.\nIn India they knew from the beginning that the sun and moon were essential even for plant life. In the\nWest, also, people have known for hundreds, if not thousands, of years that although the light and heat\nof the sun causes the germination of seeds, it is the moon that guides their growth, and wise gardeners\nplant according to the lunar cycles. We even have the term \u201cplanting moon.\u201d Even more, all \u201cthings\u201d\nare the embodiment of Prana and Rayi. The universe is Prana and Rayi. Spirit\u2013Paramatman and\nAtman\u2013alone is independent of these two, and untouched by them.\n\u201cThe rising sun pervades the east, and fills with energy all beings that there inhabit; and likewise when\nhis rays fall on the south, the west, the north, the zenith, the nadir, and the intermediate regions, to all\nbeings that there inhabit he gives life.\u201d Just as the one sun can be reflected in numberless ways, so\nPrana enlivens all things and moves within them. The life in even an atom is Cosmic Life.\n\u201cPrana is the soul of the universe, assuming all forms; he is the light that animates and illumines all:\neven as it is written: \u2018The wise know him who assumes all forms, who is radiant, who is all-knowing,\nwho is the one light that gives light to all. He rises as the sun of a thousand rays, and abides in infinite\nplaces.\u2019\u201d Prana is Parabrahman Itself! Not only is Brahman/Prana \u201cthe soul of the universe,\u201d Brahman\nis also the forms assumed, \u201cHe shining, everything shines.\u201d Every single sentient being is a ray of that\ndivine Sun who abides in all their inmost essence.\nThe two paths\n\n\u201cPrana and Rayi, uniting, divide the year. Two are the paths of the sun\u2013two are the paths that men\ntravel after death. These are the southern and the northern. Those who desire offspring and are devoted\nto almsgiving and rituals, considering these the highest accomplishment, attain the world of the moon\nand are born again on earth. They travel by the southern path, which is the path of the fathers, and is\nindeed Rayi, the maker of forms.\u201d\nThere are two paths that can be taken after death: the path that leads to expanding life in higher realms\nof existence and the path that leads back to the world of material embodiment\u2013the paths of Prana and\nRayi.\nThe \u201cyear\u201d spoken here is not the earthly measure of time based on the movement of the earth around\nthe sun, although it is believed to be so in the degeneracy of contemporary Hinduism. Rather, it is the\ncyclic manifestation of prana within the subtle, mental bodies of each one of us. The \u201csouthern\u201d path is\nthe part of the cycle in which the prana becomes more embedded or \u201cgrounded\u201d in the consciousness of\nform\u2013the body. On the other hand, the \u201cnorthern\u201d path is the part of the cycle in which the prana\nbecomes increasingly active in the spiritual levels of our being, causing the consciousness to rise to\nhigher degrees. The supposed south and north movement of the sun has nothing whatsoever to do with\nthis, even though it is commonly thought so at this time.\nThe \u201cmoon\u201d is a symbol of the material creation which is but a reflection of higher regions of\nconsciousness, just as the moon has no light of its own, but only reflects the light of the sun.\nThe path of rebirth\n\u201cThose who desire offspring and are devoted to almsgiving and rituals, considering these the highest\naccomplishment, attain the world of the moon and are born again on earth. They travel by the southern\npath, which is the path of the fathers, and is indeed Rayi, the maker of forms.\u201d\nThis is quite clear: those who are addicted to family life and external religion are impelled by their own\nearthly desires to be reborn on earth. For such desires are rooted in earthly experience and perpetuate it.\nThe path of liberation\n\u201cBut those who are devoted to the worship of the Self, by means of austerity, continence, faith, and\nknowledge, go by the northern path and attain the world of the sun. The sun, the light, is indeed the\nsource of all energy. It is immortal, beyond fear; it is the supreme goal. For him who goes to the sun\nthere is no more birth nor death. The sun ends birth and death.\u201d\nLater in the fifth section of this upanishad it will be explained that by meditation on Om a yogi will be\nunited with the solar light and ascend to the realization of Brahman. But right now the necessary\nadjuncts to such a meditation are enumerated: austerity [tapasya], continence [brahmacharya], faith\n[shraddha], and knowledge [vidya]. Those who prepare themselves by these practices\u2013in conjunction\nwith meditation on Om\u2013will ascend to the solar world and, freed from the compulsion to rebirth, will\npass onward to the transcendental realm of Brahman.\nIn the mechanism of the universe there are many wheels within wheels as in clockwork. So the\nupanishad then speaks of the month as reflection of Prana and Rayi just like the year: \u201cPrana and Rayi,\nuniting, form the month. Its dark fortnight is Rayi, and its bright fortnight is Prana. Sages perform their\ndevotional rites in the light, with knowledge; fools, in the dark, with ignorance.\u201d\nHere, too, the material lunar phases are not being spoken of, but rather the inner cycles of spiritual\nawareness and spiritual ignorance. The wise do not act blindly, even in spiritual practice, but with\n\nunderstanding of how and why they should engage in meditation and worship. Because they lack the\nrequisite insight, the ignorant engage in superstition, even if externally they seem to be doing the same\nas the wise. Without inner awakening all is hopeless, and awakening is a matter of evolution. It cannot\ncome from an external source. This is why ordinary propagandizing religion plunges people deeper into\nignorance and folly.\nUntil the inner consciousness begins to manifest only error can be the fruition of any religion. This is\nwhy Sanatana Dharma never engages in any form of missionary persuasion or coercion. Adherents of\nthe Eternal Religion know that until a person ripens spiritually even Sanatana Dharma is meaningless\nand pointless\u2013inevitably confusing and potentially harmful. That this is true is being proven every\nmoment in the West by those who are deforming Dharma into an ego-driven diversion and often a tool\nfor the same negative domination and opportunism that has made Western religion and philosophy into\nthe absurd and destructive force it has been for centuries. And the \u201cadvaitins\u201d are the worst.\nFood\nNow a very interesting symbol is introduced: \u201cFood is Prana and Rayi. From food is produced seed,\nand from seed, in turn, are born all creatures.\u201d Nikhilananda translates this verse: \u201cFood, verily, is\nPrajapati [the Creator]. From that comes semen [retas]; from semen are all these creatures born.\u201d\nThe idea here is that Prana and Form, the two aspects of Prajapati, are manifesting as food\u2013not just\nfood that is eaten and digested, but rather all things that \u201center\u201d the sentient being\u2019s life and mind and\nshape him. The body is formed of nothing but food, and the same is true of the four subtler bodies as\nwell. The mind and the senses \u201ceat\u201d also. So we can realize that God is not only the source of all, but\nthe manifester, sustainer, and evolver of all. There is nothing around us that is not divine manifestation.\nThis is the vision the yogi strives for. \u201cAt the end of his many births the wise man takes refuge in Me.\nHe knows: \u2018All is Vasudeva.\u2018 How very rare is that great soul!\u201d\nSri Ramakrishna once said: \u201cThe Divine Mother showed me that there are not two, but one existence\nonly. It is Satchidananda alone that has taken many forms. It is He alone who has become the living\nbeings, the universe and everything. It is He who has become food.\u201d What the rishis perceived so many\nthousands of years ago can be known even today by the fervent yogi.\nHome truths\nNow it is time to get down to the solid facts, to the only sensible conclusions that can be drawn if we\naccept all the upanishad has been saying to us: \u201cThose who worship the world of creation produce\nchildren; but those alone attain the world of Brahman who are steadfast in continence, meditation, and\ntruthfulness.\u201d\nGuilty, insecure people are always demanding assurance and approval from others. They usually get it\nfrom those equally guilty (or equally foolish), and evade facing the truth about themselves. In the long\nrun such avoidance does absolutely no good, but being people who live in the moment they are\nsatisfied with the deception. This especially manifests in \u201cthose who worship the world of creation\u201d\nand materiality by their insisting on being assured that ascetic life is not necessary or superior to their\nmaya-mired mode of existence. They bullyingly demand this assurance from supposed spiritual\nteachers (and especially monastics) employing a variety of ways to get what they want. But the\nupanishadic sages are long departed from this world, and their words have been preserved for\nthousands of years. What they say can be ignored, but it cannot be denied.\nWorld worshippers become gears in \u201csociety\u201d and immerse themselves in material involvement with\n\n\u201cthe world\u2019s goods,\u201d living as they please in egocentric, self-pleasing modes of life. They may not\nengender actual children now they have learned to frustrate the natural consequences of sex, but the\nresulting consciousness will be the same. Living as they \u201cplease\u201d they are bound by the hopes and\n\u201cjoys\u201d of earthly life, creating for themselves a guaranteed return to the realm of death that is this\nworld. Sri Ramakrishna used to say: \u201cThere is no substance at all in worldly life.\u201d And there is no\nsubstance in those that expend themselves in and on the world.\nThe rare few who have seen through the sham of the world and understood the reality of the Self, live\nin a very different manner. If their karma is very good, they take up the ascetic life early on, otherwise\nthey wake up somewhere along their path in life, turn from the common folly, and become disciplined\nand purified in their mode of life. Whichever it may be, the life of all the wise is centered in\n\u201ccontinence, meditation, and truthfulness.\u201d There is no need for a comment on that, or on the final\nstatement:\n\u201cThe pure world of Brahman is attainable by those only who are neither deceitful, nor wicked, nor\nfalse.\u201d\n\nThe Powers That Make Us \u201cBe\u201d\nEach of us is both Who and What. The Who is simple to define: Individualized Consciousness or\njivatman\u2013Individualized Self. The What, on the other hands is quite complex, which is why we have\ngotten lost in it and confused for lifetimes beyond number. The first step in learning how to undo this\ndilemma is learning what is keeping it going. For that reason:\n\u201cThen Bhargava approached the teacher and asked: \u2018Holy sir, how many several powers hold together\nthis body? Which of them are most manifest in it? And which is the greatest?\u2019\u201d (Prashna Upanishad\n2:1) We need to know who our jailers are and especially who the governor of the jail may be. So:\nOur makeup\n\u201c\u2018The powers,\u2019 replied the sage, \u2018are ether, air, fire, water, earth\u2013these being the five elements which\ncompose the body; and, besides these, speech, mind, eye, ear, and the rest of the sense organs. Once\nthese powers made the boastful assertion: \u201cWe hold the body together and support it\u201d\u2019\u201d (Prashna\nUpanishad 2:2)\nThe five elements (panchabhuta) are forms of cosmic energy which make up the various bodies of the\nhuman being, including the five senses. They are not passive, but are living and moving powers.\nHowever, Bhargava has asked which powers hold together the body, which itself is formed of the\nelemental forces. Only one of them is the cohesive force which keeps the others in its magnetic field\nand enables them to assume form and function within that form. To illustrate this, Pippalada gave him a\nparable, saying that once all the elements claimed to be the dominant force in the body.\nPrana\n\u201cWhereupon Prana, the primal energy, supreme over them all, said to them: \u2018Do not deceive\nyourselves. It is I alone, dividing myself fivefold, who hold together this body and support it.\u2019 But they\nwould not believe him.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 2:3)\n\u201cEven the smallest particle of the cosmos is the Universal Life in manifestation.\u201d\nWe see from this that the five elements are modifications of the cosmic life, the Prana (Vishwaprana),\n\nthat although the body seems to be formed only of the five elements, the Prana itself is the underlying\nsubstratum as the ocean is to the waves. The body, then, is really nothing but Prana, as is anything else\nin the realm of relative existence. Even the smallest particle of the cosmos is the Universal Life in\nmanifestation.\nAnother point is the supposed conversation between the elements. This is not just a device in a fable,\nbut is an indication that since all things are manifestations of Cosmic Life they can take on a seemingly\nindependent life (and even consciousness) of their own. This is a fundamental trait of Maya, the\nCosmic Illusion, one which lies at the root of most confusion and ignorance.\nThe proof\n\u201cPrana, to justify himself, made as if he intended to leave the body. But as he rose and appeared to be\ngoing, all the rest realized that if he went they also would have to depart with him; and as Prana again\nseated himself, the rest found their respective places. As bees go out when their queen goes out, and\nreturn when she returns, so was it with speech, mind, vision, hearing, and the rest. Convinced of their\nerror, the powers now praised Prana, saying:\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 2:4)\nAll the elements of the cosmos are rooted in Prana. It is the same with the elements and the senses in\nthe individual\u2019s body complex (for the human being has five bodies corresponding to the five\nelements). Just as the waves are in total dependence upon the ocean for their very being, so everything\ncosmic and microcosmic depend upon Prana. This is why Om is called the Pranava: It is the soundform of Prana, the mantric syllable by which the Prana is contacted and controlled. Furthermore, the\nbreath (also called prana) is the outermost, physical manifestation of prana. Because of this the yogi\njoins his inner intonations of Om to his breath in the highest form of pranayama.\n\u201cPranayama is accomplished by effortlessly breathing and joining to it the repetition of the sacred\nOm.\u201d\n\u201cThat which causes all the pranas to prostrate themselves before and get merged in the Paramatman\n[the Supreme Soul: God], so as to attain identity with Him, is for that reason known as the Pranava.\u201d\n(Atharvashikha Upanishad 1:10) \u201cWith Om alone he should breathe.\u201d (Amritabindu Upanishad 20)\n\u201cPranayama is accomplished through concentrating the mind on Om.\u201d (Saubhagyalakshmi Upanishad)\n\u201cThe Pranava alone becomes the pranayama.\u201d (Shandilya Upanishad 6:2 ) \u201cPranayama is composed of\nthe Pranava, Om. [Therefore] he should repeat the Pranava mentally. This only will be pranayama.\u201d\n(Darshan Upanishad 6:2,5,6) \u201cPranayama is accomplished by effortlessly breathing and joining to it the\nrepetition of the sacred Om.\u201d (Yoga Vashishtha 5:78)\nThe powers of Prana\nHe who controls Prana controls all since Prana is all. Therefore the elements praised Prana, saying:\n\u201c \u2018As fire, Prana bums; as the sun, he shines; as cloud, he rains; as Indra, he rules the gods; as\nwind, he blows; as the moon, he nourishes all. He is that which is visible and also that which is\ninvisible. He is immortal life.\n\u201c \u2018As spokes in the hub of a wheel, so is everything made fast in Prana\u2013the Rik, the Yajur, the\nSama, all sacrifices, the Kshatriyas, and the Brahmins.\n\u201c \u2018O Prana, lord of creation, thou movest in the womb, and art born again. To thee who, as\nbreath, dwellest in the body, all creatures bring offerings.\n\n\u201c \u2018Thou, as fire, dost carry oblations to the gods; and through thee the fathers receive their\nofferings. To every organ of sense thou givest its function.\n\u201c \u2018Prana, thou art the creator; thou art the destroyer by thy prowess; and thou art the protector.\nThou movest in the sky as the sun, and lord of lights art thou.\n\u201c \u2018Prana, when thou showerest down rain, thy creatures rejoice, hoping that they will find food,\nas much as they desire.\n\u201c \u2018Thou art purity itself, thou art the master of all that exists, thou art fire, the eater of offerings.\nWe, the organs of sense, offer to thee thy food\u2013to thee, the father of all.\n\u201c \u2018That power of thine which dwells in speech, in the ear, and in the eye, and which pervades\nthe heart\u2013make that propitious, and forsake us not.\n\u201c \u2018Whatsoever exists in the universe is dependent on thee, O Prana. Protect us as a mother\nprotects her children. Grant us prosperity and grant us wisdom.\u2019\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 2:5-13)\nObviously, then, the yogi cannot neglect the cultivation of Prana and Pranava together.\n\nPrana: Its History and Nature\nSanatana Dharma is not a \u201cshut up and believe and obey\u201d religion. Those who follow the Eternal\nDharma must gain the fullest knowledge of how things work, for without that knowledge mastery will\nbe impossible. And mastery is the result of evolution. Prana, the universal life force, must be known\nabout and mastered. So:\nConscious being\n\u201cWhen it was the turn of Kousalya, he put this question: \u201cMaster, of what is Prana born; how does he\nenter the body; how does he live there after dividing himself; how does he go out; how does he\nexperience what is outside; and how does he hold together the body, the senses, and the mind?\u201d\n(Prashna Upanishad 3:1)\nAll these questions are going to be answered subsequently, so the only important point is the referring\nto prana as a conscious being\u2013which it is because it is the life of Brahman and therefore is Brahman.\nThe fact that everything is conscious is unique to the teachings of Sanatana Dharma. Science considers\nitself extremely bold in cautiously approaching this concept and tentatively postulating it. Those in the\nWest who bravely make the statement as evident fact are those whose thinking has\u2013at least in its\nancestry\u2013been derived from the wisdom of India.\nThe worthy questioner\n\u201cTo which the sage replied: Kousalya, you ask very difficult questions; but since you are a sincere\nseeker after the truth of Brahman, I must answer.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 3:2) This I have seen for myself\nin India. The great saints just will not bother with the idly curious and the hopelessly shallow. But they\nwill gladly speak with those who are seeking the knowledge of Reality.\nOnce I made the mistake of taking a Western spiritual wanderer to meet Maitri Devi, a beloved saint in\nNew Delhi. When he told her he wanted to ask a question she replied in Hindi: \u201cI do not speak\nEnglish.\u201d When he asked if someone could translate his questions she again responded: \u201cI do not speak\nEnglish.\u201d So I said to him quietly: \u201cTell me your question and I will ask it.\u201d For quite some time he\n\nwould softly tell me his questions and I would ask them\u2013in English!\u2013and she would readily answer\nthrough a translator. I appreciated her kindness to me, but I also decided to never again bother her with\nroamabouts. Other saints I met would do the same\u2013some more diplomatically, others not so tactful.\nWe should learn from this and question ourselves as to why we \u201cseek\u201d and even why we study: To\neventually reach the knowledge of God, or just to cram more ideas in our head to show how \u201cwise\u201d we\nare? Yogananda often spoke of those who had \u201cspiritual indigestion\u201d from cramming useless\nphilosophy into their minds.\nBut Kousalya is a worthy questioner, so the sage replies:\nPrana in us\n\u201cPrana is born of the Self. Like a man and his shadow, the Self and Prana are inseparable. Prana enters\nthe body at birth, that the desires of the mind, continuing from past lives, may be fulfilled.\u201d (Prashna\nUpanishad 3:3)\nJust as the cosmos is an extension of the Consciousness that is Brahman, in the same way our\nindividual prana is an extension of our Self (atman). It is inseparable from the Self because it is the\nSelf. This is the authentic non-duality (advaita) of the upanishads, not a negation or denial of either\nPrakriti or prana. Seeing them as separate from Spirit, and therefore dual, is the error\u2013not\nacknowledging their intimate reality.\nPrana provides the continuity between our present and past lives\u2013both minds and bodies. It is also the\nforce that enables the continuation of our evolution from past lives, carries us through this present life\nand through future ones as well. Prana truly is Life itself.\nThis verse also tells us that karma is a matter of the mind, and not some external force. Change the\nmind and you change the karma\u2013or even dissolve it. It need never extend into our external existence.\n\u201cWorking out karma\u201d is not a compelling necessity. We are never slaves to karma. We are its creators\nand its masters, at least potentially. But we have forgotten that fact and lost control of our karma. It\nmust be regained if we would be free.\nIts \u201cassociates\u201d\n\u201cAs a king employs officials to rule over different portions of his kingdom, so Prana associates with\nhimself four other Pranas, each a portion of himself and each assigned a separate function.\u201d (Prashna\nUpanishad 3:4) We usually speak of \u201cfive pranas,\u201d but there is really only pure Prana and its four\nmodalities.\nPrana: Vital energy; life-breath; life-force. In the human body the prana is divided into five forms: 1)\nPrana: the prana that moves upward; 2) Apana: The prana that moves downward, producing the\nexcretory functions in general. 3) Vyana: The prana that holds prana and apana together and produces\ncirculation in the body. 4) Samana: The prana the carries the grosser material of food to the apana and\nbrings the subtler material to each limb; the general force of digestion. 4) Udana: The prana which\nbrings up or carries down what has been drunk or eaten; the general force of assimilation.\nIf this is kept in mind the following will be more comprehensible and meaningful.\n\u201cThe Prana himself dwells in eye, ear, mouth, and nose; the Apana, which is the second Prana, rules\nthe organs of excretion and generation; the Samana, which is the third Prana, inhabits the navel and\ngoverns digestion and assimilation.\n\n\u201cThe Self dwells in the lotus of the heart, whence radiate a hundred and one nerves [nadis]. From each\nof these proceed one hundred others, which are smaller, and from each of these, again, seventy-two\nthousand others, which are smaller still. In all these moves the Vyana, which is the fourth Prana.\n\u201cAnd then at the moment of death, through the nerve in the center of the spine, the Udana, which is the\nfifth Prana, leads the virtuous man upward to higher birth, the sinful man downward to lower birth, and\nthe man who is both virtuous and sinful to rebirth in the world of men.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 3:5-7)\nThis final verse is an interpretive translation saying more than is really there. Swami Nikhilananda\ntranslates it literally: \u201cAnd then udana, ascending upward through one of them, conducts the departing\nsoul to the virtuous world, for its virtuous deeds; to the sinful world, for its sinful deeds; and to the\nworld of men, for both.\u201d As you see, there is no mention of a \u201cnerve in the center of the spine,\u201d the\nsushumna. The nadi of ascending consciousness is spoken of at the end of the Katha Upanishad thusly:\n\u201cRadiating from the lotus of the heart there are a hundred and one nerves. One of these ascends toward\nthe thousand-petaled lotus in the brain. If, when a man comes to die, his vital force passes upward and\nout through this nerve, he attains immortality; but if his vital force passes out through another nerve, he\ngoes to one or another plane of mortal existence and remains subject to birth and death.\u201d (Katha\nUpanishad 2:3:16) Here is what I wrote in comment on this verse:\n\u201cBy \u2018heart\u2019 is meant the hub\u2013located in the midst of the upper trunk of the body\u2013of subtle passages\nknown as nadis (here translated \u2018nerves\u2019) through which the life force (prana) circulates throughout the\ngross and subtle bodies, just as the blood circulates from the heart through the veins of the physical\nbody. One hundred of these nadis direct the life force to the life processes of the bodies and are the\nforces of embodiment. One, unique, nadi, however, rises directly upward from the heart-hub into the\nhead. (This nadi rises from the heart directly into the head\u2013it is not the passage in the midst of the\nspine.) If at the time of death the departing spirit leaves through that channel, he gains immortality. But\nif his consciousness attaches itself to any of the hundred other nadis he will be impelled into the subtle\nworlds that lead inexorably back to incarnation in relativity.\n\u201cIn every meditation, by intoning Om in time with the breath we activate this channel, causing the life\nforce to spontaneously and effortlessly, flow upward into the thousand-petalled lotus in the head toward\nthe divine radiance that shines above and upon the upper levels of the brain-lotus. That Divine Light is\nthe essence of Om, the Life-Giving Word, the Pranava. Then at the end of life, having prepared himself\nby this practice, sitting in meditation the yogi ascends upward from the body into the realm of\nimmortality.\u201d\nCosmic prana\nSince each of us is a reflection of the universe, there is a cosmic pranic arrangement also, so the sage\ncontinues:\n\u201cThe sun is the Prana of the universe. It rises to help the Prana in the eye of man to see. The power of\nearth maintains the Apana in man. The ether between the sun and the earth is the Samana, and the allpervading air is the Vyana.\n\u201cThe Udana is fire, and therefore he whose bodily heat has gone out dies, after which his senses are\nabsorbed in the mind, and he is born again. Whatever his thought at the moment of death, this it is that\nunites a man with Prana, who in turn, uniting himself with Udana and with the Self, leads the man to be\nreborn in the world he merits.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 3:8-10)\nThis final principle is the most important. It is expanded in the Gita in this way: \u201cAt the hour of death,\n\nwhen a man leaves his body, he must depart with his consciousness absorbed in me. Then he will be\nunited with me. Be certain of that. Whatever a man remembers at the last, when he is leaving the body,\nwill be realized by him in the hereafter; because that will be what his mind has most constantly dwelt\non, during this life. Therefore you must remember me at all times, and do your duty. If your mind and\nheart are set upon me constantly, you will come to me. Never doubt this. Make a habit of practicing\nmeditation, and do not let your mind be distracted. In this way you will come finally to the Lord, who\nis the light-giver, the highest of the high.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 3:5-8)\nThis is why the japa and meditation of Om is \u201cThe Way,\u201d as Patanjali states in the Yoga Sutras (1:28)\nThe knowing of Prana: immortality\nThe importance of knowing the functions of Prana by direct experience\u2013through yoga practice\u2013is\nsummed up by the sage, saying:\n\u201cThe progeny of him who knows Prana as I have revealed him to you is never cut off; and he himself\nbecomes immortal.\n\u201cIt was said of old: One who knows the Prana\u2013whence he has his source, how he enters the body, how\nhe lives there after dividing himself five-fold, what are his inner workings\u2014such an one attains to\nimmortality, yea, even to immortality.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 3:11, 12)\nFor, as the other upanishads declare: Prana is Brahman.\n\nThe Witnessing Self\nThe one in the three\n\u201cGargya then asked: \u2018Master, when a man\u2019s body sleeps, who is it within that sleeps, and who is awake,\nand who is dreaming? Who then experiences happiness, and with whom are all the sense organs\nunited?\u2019\u201d(Prashna Upanishad 4:1)\nAnyone who ponders the nature of consciousness comes to realize that there are three modes of\nexperience: waking, dream, and dreamless sleep. All three of these states are experienced by a single\nwitness who says: \u201cI slept without dream,\u201d \u201cI slept and dreamed,\u201d and \u201cI am now awake.\u201d Who is that\nwitness? This is Gargya\u2019s inquiry. Who is the unchanging witness of change? Who is the unseen seer?\nFor no intelligent person of unclouded intellect can doubt the existence of such a one.\nSleep\n\u201c\u2018As the rays of the sun, O Gargya, when he sets,\u2019 replied the sage, \u2018gather themselves up in his disk of\nlight, to come out again when he rises, so the senses gather themselves up in the mind, the highest of\nthem all. Therefore when a man does not hear, see, smell, taste, touch, speak, grasp, enjoy, we say that\nhe sleeps. Only the Pranas are then awake in the body, and the mind is led nearer to the Self.\u2019\u201d (Prashna\nUpanishad 4:2-4)\nPrana is the primal life-force or vital energy. The prana that manifests in the evolving universe also\nmanifests in the evolving body of each human being. In the body there are five basic forms of prana: 1)\nPrana, the prana that moves upward; 2) Apana: The prana that moves downward, producing the\nexcretory functions in general. 3) Vyana: The prana that holds prana and apana together and produces\ncirculation in the body. 4) Samana: The prana that carries the grosser material of food to the apana and\nbrings the subtler material to each limb; the general force of digestion. 5) Udana: The prana which\n\nbrings up or carries down what has been drunk or eaten; the general force of assimilation.\nThe pranas also correspond to the five elements: earth (prithvi), water (apa), fire (tejas), air (vayu), and\nether (akasha). One of these five elements is the foundation for one of the five senses: earth=smell,\nwater=taste, fire=sight, air=touch, and ether=hearing/speech.\nIn the waking state all the pranas are quite active and fundamentally outflowing, even those that\nmaintain the internal functions of the body being externalized through being expended in the\nfulfillment of their tasks. But in sleep they withdraw into the inner reservoirs of the body and the state\nof sleep occurs. On the subtlest energy level they withdraw into the manas, the energy field we call the\nmind. For the mind is the highest \u201csense,\u201d being the sum and goal of them all. It is not amiss to say that\nthe senses serve the mind\u2013at least when the right order prevails. Otherwise they drag the mind\nhelplessly along addicting and enslaving it. Breaking the web of this addiction-slavery is then\nimpossible without the practice of pranayama\u2013control and refinement of the pranas. For this reason all\nviable spiritual traditions have methods that involve breath\u2013the most objective manifestation of prana\u2013\nto some degree.\nWhen the pranas withdraw into the mind, their distracting activities lessen\u2013unless they occupy and\noverwhelm the mind with constant and vivid dreaming. When/If the mind is thus granted a reprieve\nfrom their clamor, it begins to sense what is behind it, just as it is behind the senses. The mind is the\nwitness of the senses, but it is also witnessed. That ultimate witness is the Self. Therefore the upanishad\nsays that in sleep \u201cthe mind is led nearer to the Self.\u201d\nDreams and dreamlessness\nWhere do dreams come from? Gargya has not asked, but Pippalada tells him: \u201cWhile in dream, the\nmind revives its past impressions. Whatever it has seen, it sees again; whatever it has heard, it hears\nagain; whatever it has enjoyed in various countries and in various quarters of the earth, it enjoys again.\nWhat has been seen and not seen, heard and not heard, enjoyed and not enjoyed, both the real and the\nunreal, it sees; yea, it sees all.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 4:5) Everyone is creative in the dream state, though\nsome are definitely better writer/directors of their inner movies than others. He continues: \u201cWhen the\nmind is overpowered by deep slumber, it dreams no more. It rests happily in the body.\u201d (Prashna\nUpanishad 4:6)\nFrom the very first yogis have spoken of the importance of the dreamless, deep sleep state they call\nsushupti. This is because in dreamless sleep we are aware of awareness itself with no interference from\nthe senses. We are aware deep within ourselves, aware of our nature as simple, pure consciousness.\nDreamless sleep is also proof that the Self exists. For although no objects are presented to the mind,\nthere is a witness of that non-experiencing. Otherwise we would not awaken and say: \u201cI slept but had\nno dreams at all.\u201d Instead we would not know any time had passed, would not know that we had been\nasleep. That witness which cognizes the waking, dream, and dreamless states is the Atman itself.\nThere is a higher form \u201cwhen sushupti [the dreamless sleep state] is rightly cognized [experienced]\nwhile conscious,\u201d says the Shandilya Upanishad. In that state we are \u201casleep while awake\u201d and are\nfully conscious of the fact. This is very near the actual experience of the Self and partakes of that\nexperience to some degree, the happiness and ease we feel being a touch of the joy (ananda) that is the\nnature of the Self. It is extremely valuable because it shows us that when all sensory experience is gone\nbeyond there yet remains the truth of ourselves in the form of pure, unconditioned consciousness that is\nthe Self.\nIn deep meditation we enter this state intentionally and begin working our inner transformation from\n\nthis center by the subtle intonations of Om.\nTo the Self\n\u201cAs birds, my friend, fly to a tree for rest, even so do all these things fly to the Self: Earth and its\npeculiar essence, water and its peculiar essence, fire and its peculiar essence, air and its peculiar\nessence, ether and its peculiar essence, the eye and what it sees, the ear and what it hears, the nose and\nwhat it smells, the tongue and what it tastes, the skin and what it touches, the voice and what it speaks,\nthe hands and what they grasp, the feet and what they walk on, the mind and what it perceives, the\nintellect and what it understands, the ego and what it appropriates, the heart and what it loves, light and\nwhat it illumines, energy and what it binds together.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 4:7, 8)\nThey \u201cfly to the Self\u201d because the Self is their origin. They are returning to their source after ages upon\nages of separation in relative existence/experience.\n\u201cFor verily it is the Self that sees, hears, smells, tastes, thinks, knows, acts. He is Brahman, whose\nessence is knowledge. He is the immutable Self, the Supreme.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 4:9) The Self is the\nExperiencer in all beings, the knower of all things, and the doer of all acts. This points out the fact that\nMaya\u2013illusion\u2013is the misperception of things, not perception itself. Also, sense experience, thought,\nand actions are NOT illusions. It is our misunderstanding of them that is illusion. The Self is real and\nits experiences are real. It is true that they are purely mental in nature, but is the mind not real? Again,\nit is a matter how we perceive.\nThe Self is a wave of the ocean of Brahman, the Absolute, whose nature is Consciousness. The Self is\nimmutable, and beyond it there is nothing else, for in essence it is one with Brahman, the ultimate\nBeing. Yet, the Self needs to attain itself, needs to attain the consciousness of its Being which is\nBrahman. Therefore the sage says further:\nThe end result\n\u201cHe who knows the immutable, the pure, the shadowless, the bodiless, the colorless, attains to\nBrahman, O my friend. Such an one becomes all-knowing, and he dwells in all beings. Of him it is\nwritten: \u2018He who knows that immutable Self, wherein live the mind, the senses, the pranas, the\nelements\u2013verily such an one knows all things, and realizes the Self in all.\u2019\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 4:10,\n11)\nThis is most important, for it indicates that first we know the Self\u2013the individual Self, the jivatman\u2013and\nthen we are enabled to know the Supreme Self, the Paramatman: Brahman. And the Self we will know\nis itself:\nImmutable. Eternally changeless, incapable of being either diminished or increased, for it is one with\nthe Infinite.\nPure. Ever only itself, never really being influenced or changed by any thing whatsoever. Untainted by\nany contact, for it is untouchable.\nShadowless. The Self is Pure Light within which there is no shadow of darkness or differentiation. It is\nalways exactly what it is\nBodiless. It is perfectly non-dual. It is neither inside or outside of any thing. It cannot be contained. It is\nabsolutely one, having nothing appended to it or necessary to it.\n\nColorless. It has no \u201cqualities\u201d or \u201ccharacteristics\u201d but is always I AM. The three gunas are not present\nin it, nor are any gradations of any kind. It is indescribable. All we can really say about it is what it is\nnot.\nAll of these terms indicate that the Self is the same as Brahman. And the Self that knows its Self\u2013\nBrahman, \u201cwherein live the mind, the senses, the pranas, the elements\u201d\u2013does in truth come to know all\nthings and the Self in all things.\nOmniscience and omnipresence are experienced by that liberated spirit who knows its oneness with\nThe All.\n\nMeditation on Om\nSo far the questions put to Pippalada have been about the components of the human organism which\nboth empower and limit it. In the last section the subject of the Self was considered\u2013specifically the\nnature of the Self and the results of knowing the Self. Now we approach the subject of the way in\nwhich the Self is known. Without knowing this, all the foregoing teaching is pointless.\nLife and death\n\u201cWhereupon Satyakama, coming near to the master, said: Venerable sir, if a man meditate upon the\nsyllable OM all his life, what shall be his reward after death?\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 5:1)\nSatyakama understood that what really mattered was not short-term gain in this life, but the state of\nconsciousness that would determine where the individual would go after death when stripped of body,\npossessions, relationships, and all that is \u201cof the earth, earthly\u201d\u2013when he has nothing but his degree of\nevolution to determine his future.\nSo he wants to know what will be the result of meditating on Om throughout one\u2019s life. Literally, the\nSanskrit texts asks what will be the result of intense meditation (abhidhyana) on Om, and what world\n(loka) will be won (jayati) by means of that meditation. For the world in which we find ourselves after\ndeath reveals our fundamental state of consciousness.\nThe supreme attainment\n\u201cAnd the master answered him thus: Satyakama, OM is Brahman\u2013both the conditioned and the\nunconditioned, the personal and the impersonal. By meditating upon it the wise man may attain either\nthe one or the other.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 5:2)\nBrahman is absolutely one, but from our present perspective seems to be of a dual character. In this\nverse the expression \u201chigher\u201d (para) and \u201clower\u201d (apara) are used, though Prabhavananda has used the\nexplanatory translations \u201cconditioned and the unconditioned\u201d and \u201cthe personal and the impersonal.\u201d It\nis more usual to use the terms nirguna (without attributes or qualities\u2013guna) and saguna (with attributes\nor qualities) in relation to Brahman. In A Brief Sanskrit Glossary Nirguna Brahman is defined as: \u201cThe\nimpersonal, attributeless Absolute beyond all description or designation.\u201d Saguna Brahman is defined\nas: \u201cThe supreme Absolute conceived of as endowed with qualities like mercy, omnipotence,\nomniscience, omnipotence, etc., as distinguished from the undifferentiated Absolute\u2013Nirguna\nBrahman.\u201d Nirguna Brahman is the \u201chigher\u201d Brahman and Saguna Brahman is the \u201clower\u201d or lesser.\nAgain, this distinction is just a means of expression adopted for the limitations of our human intellects.\nPresently it is commonly assumed\u2013erroneously\u2013that there is one way to meditate on Nirguna Brahman\nand another way to meditate on Saguna Brahman. But this was not so in the upanishadic era, as can be\n\nseen from the texts cited in both Om Yoga and The Word That Is God. It was understood that Om is allinclusive, since It is Brahman Itself. Consequently, meditation on Om is meditation on both Nirguna\nand Saguna Brahman. Our perceptions will be according to whichever aspect we wish to contact.\nAccording to our knowing\nIt also depends on our experience-knowlege of Om, not mere intellectual ideas. For Pippalada then\nsays: \u201cIf he meditate upon OM with but little knowledge of its meaning, but nevertheless is enlightened\nthereby, upon his death he will be immediately born again on this earth, and during his new life he will\nbe devoted to austerity, continence, and faith, and will attain to spiritual greatness.\u201d (Prashna\nUpanishad 5:3) That is, if for whatever reasons the yogi gains but little experience-knowledge of Om,\nstill he will be enlightened by it to some degree. This being so, he will not spend a long period in the\nastral world, but will quickly be reborn so he can take up yoga again and make better progress than he\ndid before. To ensure this, in his new life \u201che will be devoted to austerity, continence, and faith, and\nwill attain to spiritual greatness.\u201d\n\u201cIf, again, he meditate upon OM with a greater knowledge of its meaning, upon his death he will\nascend to the lunar heaven, and after he has partaken of its pleasures will return again to earth.\u201d\n(Prashna Upanishad 5:4) \u201cThe lunar heaven\u201d is the astral world in which the yogi experiences great\nhappiness and even power according to the immense strength of positive karma which is engendered by\nthe practice of yoga. Yet he will in time take birth again on the earth.\n\u201cBut if he meditate upon OM in the full consciousness that it is one with God, upon his death he will be\nunited with the light that is in the sun, he will be freed from evil, even as a snake is freed from its\nslough, and he will ascend to God\u2019s dwelling place. There he will realize Brahman, who evermore\nabides in the heart of all beings\u2013Brahman Supreme!\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 5:5) Those who experience\nin meditation that Om truly is Divinity Itself\u2013is their own Divine Self\u2013will be freed from the\ncompulsion to earthly rebirth as well as all that has bound them to lower things and, united with the\nLight of Spirit that invisibly shines upon us through the intermediary of the sun, will ascend to the\nheights of existence and beyond into the transcendent Being of Nirguna Brahman.\nThen Pippalada cites two verses even older than the upanishads that encapsulate all this:\n\u201cConcerning the sacred syllable OM it is written: \u201cThe syllable OM, when it is not fully understood,\ndoes not lead beyond mortality. When it is fully understood, and meditation is therefore rightly\ndirected, a man is freed from fear, whether he be awake, dreaming, or sleeping the dreamless sleep, and\nattains to Brahman.\n\u201cBy virtue of a little understanding of OM a man returns to earth after death. By virtue of a greater\nunderstanding he attains to the celestial sphere. By virtue of a complete understanding he learns what is\nknown only to the seers. The sage, with the help of OM, reaches Brahman, the fearless, the undecaying,\nthe immortal!\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 5:6, 7)\nAs Sri Ramana Maharshi said: Om ever shines within us as the Self. May we all realize this.\n\nWhere is the Self?\n\u201cLastly, Sukesa approached the sage and said: \u2018Holy sir, Hiranyanabha, prince of Kosala, once asked\nme this question: \u201c\u201cSukesa, do you know the Self and his sixteen parts?\u201d\u201d I replied, \u201c\u201cI do not. Surely,\nif I had known them, I should have taught them to you. I will not lie, for he who lies perishes, root and\nall.\u201d\u201d The prince silently mounted his chariot and went away. So now I ask of thee, Where is the\n\nSelf?\u2019\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 6:1)\nThis is an introduction to the actual teachings of this section, but it contains a couple of interesting\npoints.\nSixteen parts\nThe Self is said in this verse to have sixteen \u201cparts.\u201d Yet the Self is one, so how can this be? The\nupanishad is referring to the \u201cextensions\u201d or instruments of the Self by means of which it manifests\nwithin relative existence. They will be enumerated shortly.\nSpiritual honesty\nIt is impressive when a spiritual teacher honestly admits to not knowing something. In a filmed\ninterview, Carl Jung was asked what he thought some dream symbol meant. He laughed and said: \u201cI\nhaven\u2019t the faintest idea!\u201d End of question!\nHere we see the integrity of Sukesha who readily admitted not knowing the answer to a question. And\nhis reason he gives, saying: \u201cI will not lie, for he who lies perishes, root and all.\u201d Satya\u2013truthfulness\u2013is\none of the essential observances of Yoga according to Patanjali, and here we see why. This should be\ntaken to heart by us throughout our life. Sri Ramakrishna said that a person can realize God by\nscrupulously adhering to truth.\nAbode of the Self\nWhere is the Self? \u201cThe sage replied: \u201cMy child, within this body dwells the Self, from whom sprang\nthe sixteen parts of the universe; and in this manner they came into being.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 6:2)\nHow precious, then, is the human body! And how foolish it is to think that spiritual experience will\ninvolve \u201cescaping\u201d from the body and flying off to some \u201cspiritual world\u201d to hobnob with angels and\nmasters!\nNow he will describe the sequence of cosmic manifestation.\nStabilizing Itself within creation\n\u201cIf, creating, I enter my creation, the Self reflected, what is there to bind me to it; what is there to go\nout from it when I go out, to stay within it when I stay?\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 6:3) This is a problem for\nboth the infinite and the finite Selves.\n\u201cPondering thus, and in answer to his thought, he made Prana; and from Prana he made desire; and\nfrom desire he made ether, air, fire, water, earth, the senses, the mind, and food; and from food he made\nvigor, penance, the Vedas, the sacrificial rites, and all the worlds. Thereafter, in the worlds, he created\nnames. And the number of the elements he thus created was sixteen.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 6:4) We need\nto take this part by part.\nPondering thus, and in answer to his thought, he made\u2026. The world was made by the mere thought of\nGod. As said before, this is the \u201cdream\u201d of God; it is all creative thought. Merely thinking of something\ngets us human beings nowhere\u2013we have to bring it into manifestation by action and materials. This is\nnot the case with God. He thought\u2013and so it was. Consequently, in the following list of cosmic\ningredients, we must not think of them as \u201cstuff\u201d but as cosmic thoughts.\nPrana. First the Universal Life Force (vishwaprana) was manifested. This was the formless, basic\n\n\u201csubstance\u201d of relative existence.\nDesire. Next came the power of intention or aspiration. For unless we are motivated with the idea that\nsomething can be attained, we will not act. So the power to desire or will\u2013and thereby to shape and\nwork with the cosmic prana\u2013is absolutely necessary for anything to \u201chappen.\u201d \u201cDesire\u201d is the\nexplanatory translation of Prabhavananda, and I think it is the best one. But the actual word in the\nSanskrit is shraddha\u2013faith. This was used, Shankara says, to mean a stimulus to the individual spirits\n(jivas). That is, subliminally all of us know that we have come from God and are intended to return to\nGod. With this aspiration as the deepest impulse of our being, we are moving up the evolutionary path,\never onward, however many delays our ignorance and laziness may bring about.\nEther, air, fire, water, earth\u2013the great primal elements and all their variations down to their material\nmanifestations.\nThe senses. Actually, the word is indriyam, which means \u201corgans\u201d and often does mean only the five\norgans of perception (jnanendriyas): ear, skin, eye, tongue, and nose, but Shankara feels (and so do I)\nthat it no doubt includes the five organs of action (karmendriyas): voice, hand, foot, organ of excretion,\nand the organ of generation. The indriyas are here being thought of as \u201cwrappings\u201d of the individual\nconsciousness as well as being instruments of bodily function.\nMind. The indriyas are unconscious. That which activates them is the mind which both perceives and\nacts through them.\nFood. By this term is meant all that goes to affect the evolving consciousness, from physical food to\npsychological and intellectual impressions that shape and move our development either forward or\nbackward, according to their character. That this is so is demonstrated by those things that are said to be\n\u201cmade\u201d from food:\nVigor. Virya is the strength and energy than manifests in body, mind, and intellect\u2013especially as will\npower in the yogi.\nPenance. Tapasya is practical spiritual disciplines, such as moral observances, self-purification, and the\npractice of meditation.\nVedas. The word is not Veda, but mantra\u2013words of power which produce changes spiritually, mentally\nand physically by their repetition. From vigor comes the capacity for spiritual discipline, which is\nmanifested in the form of the repetition (japa) and meditation (dhyana) centered on mantras, especially\nthe Supreme Mantra: Om.\nSacrificial rites. This is not only an interpretive translation, it is a very narrowing one. The actual word\nis karma\u2013a very wide and far-reaching matter, indeed. Here it means the law of action/reaction which\nfuels the very existence of the world and our bodies within it. Karma causes the manifestation of the\ncosmos and impels all sentient beings to take incarnation within it in forms appropriate to their level of\nconsciousness and the nature of their past deeds, both physical and mental. Certainly merit-producing\nactions are part of karma, but karma is much more.\nAll the worlds. The many worlds (lokas) are produced in response to the varying degrees of evolution\nand past karma of the sentient beings within them.\nNames. The prime factor in relative existence is nama: name. This seems very peculiar to those whose\nphilosophy does not postulate that everything is ideation\u2013thought. But the primeval sages of India\nperceived through their meditation that the thoughtform, the idea that is the matrix around which the\n\nbody-vehicle of any manifested entity forms itself is that entity\u2019s \u201cname.\u201d In the depths of their\nmeditation the sages perceived the primal thought of each \u201cthing.\u201d Since everything is formed of\nvibration, they translated that into spoken forms. In all other languages a word is just an agreed-upon\nsymbol of an object, but in Sanskrit each word is a sound-form of the basic energy pattern of the\ndesignated object. Sanskrit is a kind of sonic physics\u2013creative speech. For that reason Sanskrit script is\ncall Devanagari\u2013The City of the Gods\u2013meaning that the divine powers manifesting as all objects\n\u201cdwell\u201d in the Sanskrit words. In the subtle levels of being the Sanskrit word IS the thing designated by\nthe word. That is why it is stated that the Name of God IS God! Om is Divinity Itself. (See the section\nentitled The Glories and Powers of Om in Om Yoga and The Word That Is God.)\nThese are the sixteen parts of the cosmic and the individual Selves.\nThe Great Return\n\u201cAs the flowing rivers, whose destination is the sea, having reached it disappear in it, losing their\nnames and forms, and men speak only of the sea; so these sixteen parts created from out his own being\nby the Self, the Eternal Seer, having returned to him from whom they came, disappear in him, their\ndestination, losing their names and forms, and people speak only of the Self. Then for man the sixteen\nparts are no more, and he attains to immortality. Thus was it said of old: \u2018The sixteen parts are spokes\nprojecting from the Self, who is the hub of the wheel. The Self is the goal of knowledge. Know him\nand go beyond death.\u2019\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 6:5, 6)\nThere is an important principle here: All that exists has emanated from the Cosmic Self and is\nwithdrawn into It\u2013and the same is true of our many levels: they have come from the true \u201cus\u201d and will\nremerge in us. The idea that \u201cthe world\u201d is to be discarded\u2013escaped from\u2013so we can be free is as\nillusory as the world from which we wish to rid ourselves. It is ignorance alone that we need to banish.\nWe need to refine all our bodies through the practice of tapasya so they will be seen as nothing more\nthan the projections of our mind\u2013projections that can be reabsorbed in the state of perfect knowing. The\nmacrocosm and the microcosm are both \u201cproper\u201d to Spirit and spirit. They are not impositions or\nprisons (though we make them so), but rays of the Self. They exist because we exist.\nThe only path to the Self is that of knowledge. Once that arises within us, death dissolves and\nimmortality alone remains.\nThe right ending\n\u201cThe sage concluded, saying: What I have told you is all that can be said about the Self, the Supreme\nBrahman. Beyond this there is naught.\u201d (Prashna Upanishad 6:7) So anything more we may say, that\nhas not already been said in the upanishads (and the Gita), will really be nothing\u2013worthless and\npointless, if not outright self-deception. This merits being taken to heart. We should toss away our\nbooks of idle philosophy and speculation and become genuine yogis. Then we will truly know That\nWhich Is To Be Known.\nSo: \u201cThe disciples worshiped the sage, and said: You are indeed our father. You have led us beyond the\nsea of ignorance. We bow down to all the great seers! Obeisance to the great seers!\u201d\nThose who teach us the truth of the Self\u2013and more: the way to realize the Self\u2013they are our true fathers,\nbegetting us in Knowledge.

O gods, may we hear auspicious words with the ears;\nWhile engaged in sacrifices,\nMay we see auspicious things with the eyes;\nWhile praising the gods with steady limbs,\nMay we enjoy a life that is beneficial to the gods.\nMay Indra of ancient fame be auspicious to us;\nMay the supremely rich (or all-knowing) Pusa (god of the earth)\nBe propitious to us;\nMay Garuda, the destroyer of evil,\nBe well disposed towards us;\nMay Brihaspati ensure our welfare.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nI-i-1: Om ! Brahma, the creator of the Universe and the protector of the world, was the first among the\ngods to manifest Himself. To His eldest son Atharva He imparted that knowledge of Brahman that is\nthe basis of all knowledge.\nI-i-2: The Knowledge of Brahman that Brahma imparted to Atharva, Atharva transmitted to Angir in\ndays of yore. He (Angir) passed it on to Satyavaha of the line of Bharadvaja. He of the line of\nBharadvaja handed down to Angiras this knowledge that had been received in succession from the\nhigher by the lower ones.\nI-i-3: Saunaka, well known as a great householder, having approached Angiras duly, asked, \u2018O adorable\nsir, (which is that thing) which having been known, all this becomes known ?\u2019\nI-i-4: To him he said, \u2018\"There are two kinds of knowledge to be acquired \u2013 the higher and the lower\";\nthis is what, as tradition runs, the knowers of the import of the Vedas say.\u2019\nI-i-5: Of these, the lower comprises the Rig-Veda, Yajur-Veda, Sama-Veda, Atharva-Veda, the science\nof pronunciation etc., the code of rituals, grammar, etymology, metre and astrology. Then there is the\nhigher (knowledge) by which is attained that Imperishable.\n\nI-i-6: (By the higher knowledge) the wise realize everywhere that which cannot be perceived and\ngrasped, which is without source, features, eyes, and ears, which has neither hands nor feet, which is\neternal, multiformed, all-pervasive, extremely subtle, and undiminishing and which is the source of all.\nI-i-7: As a spider spreads out and withdraws (its thread), as on the earth grow the herbs (and trees), and\nas from a living man issues out hair (on the head and body), so out of the Imperishable does the\nUniverse emerge here (in this phenomenal creation).\nI-i-8: Through knowledge Brahman increases in size. From that is born food (the Unmanifested). From\nfood evolves Prana (Hiranyagarbha); (thence the cosmic) mind; (thence) the five elements; (thence) the\nworlds; (thence) the immortality that is in karmas.\nI-i-9: From Him, who is omniscient in general and all-knowing in detail and whose austerity is\nconstituted by knowledge, evolve this (derivative) Brahman, name, colour and food.\nI-ii-1:That thing that is such, is true.\nThe karmas that the wise discovered in the mantras are accomplished variously (in the context of the\nsacrifice) where the three Vedic duties get united. You perform them for ever with desire for the true\nresults. This is your path leading to the fruits of karma acquired by yourselves.\nI-ii-2: When, the fire being set ablaze, the flame shoots up, one should offer the oblations into that part\nthat is in between the right and the left.\nI-ii-3: It (i.e. the Agnihotra) destroys the seven worlds of that man whose Agnihotra (sacrifice) is\nwithout Darsa and Paurnamasa (rites), devoid of Chaturmasya, bereft of Agrayana, unblest with guests,\ngoes unperformed, is unaccompanied by Vaisvadeva (rite) and is performed perfunctorily.\nI-ii-4: Kali, Karali, Manojava and Sulohita and that which is Sudhumravarna, as also Sphulingini, and\nthe shining Visvaruchi \u2013 these are the seven flaming tongues.\nI-ii-5: These oblations turn into the rays of the sun and taking him up they lead him, who performs the\nrites in these shining flames at the proper time, to where the single lord of the gods presides over all.\nI-ii-6: Saying, \u2018Come, come\u2019, uttering pleasing words such as, \u2018This is your well-earned, virtuous path\nwhich leads to heaven\u2019, and offering him adoration, the scintillating oblations carry the sacrificer along\nthe rays of the sun.\nI-ii-7: Since these eighteen constituents of a sacrifice, on whom the inferior karma has been said to rest,\nare perishable because of their fragility, therefore those ignorant people who get elated with the idea\n\u2018This is (the cause of) bliss\u2019, undergo old age and death over again.\nI-ii-8: Remaining within the fold of ignorance and thinking, \u2018We are ourselves wise and learned\u2019, the\nfools, while being buffeted very much, ramble about like the blind led by the blind alone.\nI-ii-9: Continuing diversely in the midst of ignorance, the unenlightened take airs by thinking, \u2018We\nhave attained the goal.\u2019 Since the men, engaged in karma, do not understand (the truth) under the\ninfluence of attachment, thereby they become afflicted with sorrow and are deprived of heaven on the\nexhaustion of the results of karma.\nI-ii-10: The deluded fools, believing the rites inculcated by the Vedas and the Smritis to be the highest,\ndo not understand the other thing (that leads to) liberation. They, having enjoyed (the fruits of actions)\nin the abode of pleasure on the heights of heaven, enter this world or an inferior one.\nI-ii-11: Those who live in the forest, while begging for alms \u2013 viz. those (forest-dwellers and hermits)\nwho resort to the duties of their respective stages of life as well as to meditation \u2013 and the learned\n(householders) who have their senses under control \u2013 (they) after becoming freed from dirt, go by the\npath of the sun to where lives that Purusha, immortal and undecaying by nature.\nI-ii-12: A Brahmana should resort to renunciation after examining the worlds acquired through karma,\nwith the help of this maxim: \u2018There is nothing (here) that is not the result of karma; so what is the need\nof (performing) karma ?\u2019 For knowing that Reality he should go, with sacrificial faggots in hand, only\nto a teacher versed in the Vedas and absorbed in Brahman.\nI-ii-13: To him who has approached duly, whose heart is calm and whose outer organs are under\n\ncontrol, that man of enlightenment should adequately impart that knowledge of Brahman by which one\nrealizes the true and imperishable Purusha.\nII-i-1: That thing that is such, is true.\nAs from a fire fully ablaze, fly off sparks in their thousands that are akin to the fire, similarly O goodlooking one, from the Imperishable originate different kinds of creatures and into It again they merge.\nII-i-2: The Purusha is transcendental, since He is formless. And since He is coextensive with all that is\nexternal and internal and since He is birthless, therefore He is without vital force and without mind; He\nis pure and superior to the (other) superior imperishable (Maya).\nII-i-3: From Him originates the vital force as well as the mind, all the senses, space, air, fire, water, and\nearth that supports everything.\nII-i-4: The indwelling Self of all is surely He of whom the heaven is the head, the moon and sun are the\ntwo eyes, the directions are the two ears, the revealed Vedas are the speech, air is the vital force, the\nwhole Universe is the heart, and (It is He) from whose two feet emerged the earth.\nII-i-5: From Him emerges the fire (i.e. heaven) of which the fuel is the sun. From the moon emerges\ncloud, and (from cloud) the herbs and corns on the earth. A man sheds the semen into a woman. From\nthe Purusha have originated many creatures.\nII-i-6: From Him (emerge) the Rik, Sama and Yajur mantras, initiation, all the sacrifices \u2013 whether with\nor without the sacrificial stake \u2013 offerings to Brahmanas, the year, the sacrificer, and the worlds where\nthe moon sacrifices (all) and where the sun (shines).\nII-i-7: And from Him duly emerged the gods in various groups, the Sadhyas, human beings, beasts,\nbirds, life, rice and barley, as well as austerity, faith, truth, continence and dutifulness.\nII-i-8: From Him emerge the seven sense-organs, the seven flames, the seven kinds of fuel, the seven\noblations, and these seven seats where move the sense-organs that sleep in the cavity, (and) have been\ndeposited (by God) in groups of seven.\nII-i-9: From Him emerge all the oceans and all the mountains. From Him flow out the rivers of various\nforms. And from Him issue all the corns as well as the juice, by virtue of which the internal self verily\nexists in the midst of the elements.\nII-i-10: The Purusha alone is all this \u2013 (comprising) karma and knowledge. He who knows this\nsupreme, immortal Brahman, existing in the heart, destroys here the knot of ignorance, O good-looking\none !\nII-ii-1: (It is) effulgent, near at hand, and well known as moving in the heart, and (It is) the great goal.\nOn It are fixed all these that move, breathe, and wink or do not wink. Know this One which comprises\nthe gross and the subtle, which is beyond the ordinary knowledge of creatures, and which is the most\ndesirable and the highest of all.\nII-ii-2: That which is bright and is subtler than the subtle, and that on which are fixed all the worlds as\nwell as the dwellers of the worlds, is this immutable Brahman; It is this vital force; It, again, is speech\nand mind. This Entity, that is such, is true. It is immortal. It is to be penetrated, O good-looking one,\nshoot (at It).\nII-ii-3: Taking hold of the bow, the great weapon familiar in the Upanishads, one should fix on it an\narrow sharpened with meditation. Drawing the string, O good-looking one, hit that very target that is\nthe Imperishable, with the mind absorbed in Its thought.\nII-ii-4: Om is the bow; the soul is the arrow; and Brahman is called its target. It is to be hit by an\nunerring man. One should become one with It just like an arrow.\nII-ii-5: Know that Self alone that is one without a second, on which are strung heaven, the earth and the\ninter-space, the mind and the vital forces together with all the other organs; and give up all other talks.\nThis is the bridge leading to immortality.\nII-ii-6: Within that (heart) in which are fixed the nerves like the spokes on the hub of a chariot wheel,\n\nmoves this aforesaid Self by becoming multiformed. Meditate on the Self thus with the help of Om.\nMay you be free from hindrances in going to the other shore beyond darkness.\nII-ii-7: That Self which is omniscient in general and all-knowing in detail and which has such glory in\nthis world \u2013 that Self, which is of this kind \u2013 is seated in the space within the luminous city of\nBrahman.\nIt is conditioned by the mind, It is the carrier of the vital forces and the body, It is seated in food by\nplacing the intellect (in the cavity of the heart). Through their knowledge, the discriminating people\nrealize that Self as existing in Its fullness everywhere \u2013 the Self that shines surpassingly as blissfulness\nand immortality.\nII-ii-8: When that Self, which is both the high and the low, is realized, the knot of the heart gets united,\nall doubts become solved, and all one\u2019s actions become dissipated.\nII-ii-9: In the supreme, bright sheath is Brahman, free from taints and without parts. It is pure, and is\nthe Light of lights. It is that which the knowers of the Self realize.\nII-ii-10: There the sun does not shine, nor the moon or the stars; nor do these flashes of lightning shine\nthere. How can this fire do so ? Everything shines according as He does so; by His light all this shines\ndiversely.\nII-ii-11: All this that is in front is but Brahman, the immortal. Brahman is at the back, as also on the\nright and the left. It is extended above and below, too. This world is nothing but Brahman, the highest.\nIII-i-1: Two birds that are ever associated and have similar names, cling to the same tree. Of these, one\neats the fruit of divergent tastes, and the other looks on without eating.\nIII-i-2: On the same tree, the individual soul remains drowned (i.e. stuck), as it were; and so it moans,\nbeing worried by its impotence. When it sees thus the other, the adored Lord, and His glory, then it\nbecomes liberated from sorrow.\nIII-i-3: When the seer sees the Purusha \u2013 the golden-hued, creator, lord, and the source of the inferior\nBrahman \u2013 then the illumined one completely shakes off both merit and demerit, becomes taintless, and\nattains absolute equality.\nIII-i-4: This one is verily the Vital Force which shines divergently through all beings. Knowing this, the\nillumined man has no (further) occasion to go beyond anything in his talk. He disports in the Self,\ndelights in the Self, and is engrossed in (spiritual) effort. This one is the chief among the knowers of\nBrahman.\nIII-i-5: The bright and pure Self within the body, that the monks with (habitual effort and) attenuated\nblemishes see, is attainable verily through truth, concentration, complete knowledge, and continence,\npractised constantly.\nIII-i-6: Truth alone wins, and not untruth. By truth is laid the path called Devayana, by which the\ndesireless seers ascend to where exists the supreme treasure attainable through truth.\nIII-i-7: It is great and self-effulgent; and Its form is unthinkable. It is subtler than the subtle. It shines\ndiversely. It is farther away than the far-off, and It is near at hand in this body. Among sentient beings It\nis (perceived as) seated in this very body, in the cavity of the heart.\nIII-i-8: It is not comprehended through the eye, nor through speech, nor through the other senses; nor is\nIt attained through austerity or karma. Since one becomes purified in mind through the favourableness\nof the intellect, therefore can one see that indivisible Self through meditation.\nIII-i-9: Within (the heart in) the body, where the vital force has entered in five forms, is this subtle Self\nto be realized through that intelligence by which is pervaded the entire mind as well as the motor and\nsensory organs of all creatures. And It is to be known in the mind, which having become purified, this\nSelf reveals Itself distinctly.\nIII-i-10: The man of pure mind wins those worlds which he mentally wishes for and those enjoyable\nthings which he covets. Therefore one, desirous of prosperity, should adore the knower of the Self.\n\nIII-ii-1: He knows this supreme abode, this Brahman, in which is placed the Universe and which shines\nholy. Those wise ones indeed, who having become desireless, worship this (enlightened) person,\ntranscend this human seed.\nIII-ii-2: He who covets the desirable things, while brooding (on the virtues), is born amidst those very\nsurroundings along with the desires. But for one who has got his wishes fulfilled and who is Selfpoised, all the longings vanish even here.\nIII-ii-3: This Self is not attained through study, nor through the intellect, nor through much hearing. The\nvery Self which this one (i.e. the aspirant) seeks is attainable through that fact of seeking; this Self of\nhis reveals Its own nature.\nIII-ii-4: This Self is not attained by one devoid of strength, nor through delusion, nor through\nknowledge unassociated with monasticism. But the Self of that knower, who strives through these\nmeans, enters into the abode that is Brahman.\nIII-ii-5: Having attained this, the seers become contented with their knowledge, established in the Self,\nfreed from attachment, and composed. Having realized the all-pervasive One everywhere, these\ndiscriminating people, ever merged in contemplation, enter into the All.\nIII-ii-6: Those to whom the entity presented by the Vedantic knowledge has become fully ascertained,\nwho are assiduous and have become pure in mind through the Yoga of monasticism \u2013 all of them, at the\nsupreme moment of final departure, become identified with the supreme Immortality in the worlds that\nare Brahman, and they become freed on every side.\nIII-ii-7: To their sources repair the fifteen constituents (of the body) and to their respective gods go all\nthe gods (of the senses). The karmas and the soul appearing like the intellect, all become unified with\nthe supreme Undecaying.\nIII-ii-8: As rivers, flowing down, become indistinguishable on reaching the sea by giving up their\nnames and forms, so also the illumined soul, having become freed from name and form, reaches the\nself-effulgent Purusha that is higher than the higher (Maya).\nIII-ii-9: Anyone who knows that supreme Brahman becomes Brahman indeed. In his line is not born\nanyone who does not know Brahman. He overcomes grief, and rises above aberrations; and becoming\nfreed from the knots of the heart, he attains immortality.\nIII-ii-10: This (rule) has been revealed by the mantra (which runs thus): \u2018To them alone should one\nexpound this knowledge of b who are engaged in the practice of disciplines, versed in the Vedas, and\nindeed devoted to Brahman, who personally sacrifice to the fire called Ekarsi with faith, and by whom\nhas been duly accomplished the vow of holding fire on the head.\u2019\nIII-ii-11: The seer Angiras spoke of this Truth in the days of yore. One that has not fulfilled the vow\ndoes not read this. Salutation to the great seers. Salutation to the great seers.\nOm ! O gods, may we hear auspicious words with the ears;\nWhile engaged in sacrifices,\nMay we see auspicious things with the eyes;\nWhile praising the gods with steady limbs,\nMay we enjoy a life that is beneficial to the gods.\nMay Indra of ancient fame be auspicious to us;\nMay the supremely rich (or all-knowing) Pusa (god of the earth)\nBe propitious to us;\nMay Garuda, the destroyer of evil,\nBe well disposed towards us;\nMay Brihaspati ensure our welfare.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Mundakopanishad, included in the Atharva-Veda.\n\nMundaka Upanishad Commentary\nCommentary on the Mundaka Upanishad\u2013by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\nKnowing the ALL\nIt is an interesting trait of the Western mind that it wants encapsulations of things, lists of \u201cessentials,\u201d\nadvice on \u201cshortcuts,\u201d and \u201cwhat is the one thing?\u2026\u201d in every department of life and thought. Whether\nthis is a desire for efficiency or a form of intellectual minimalism or outright laziness is hard to say\u2013\nchances are it varies from person to person. Nevertheless, \u201cgetting to the heart of the matter\u201d is\nsomething dear to the heart of Americans, especially. They are not alone in this attitude. The\nupanishads reflect the same mentality. Perhaps that is why Vivekananda considered the West, and\nAmerica particularly, as being more suited to the teachings of Vedanta\u2013the upanishads\u2013than the\ncontemporary East.\nIn the first section of the Mundaka Upanishad we find the highest expression of this attitude:\n\u201cOut of the infinite ocean of existence arose Brahma, first-born and foremost among the gods. From\nhim sprang the universe, and he became its protector. The knowledge of Brahman, the foundation of all\nknowledge, he revealed to his first-born son, Atharva.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 1:1:1)\nA pre-creation story\nAccording to Indian texts, at the beginning of the present creation cycle Brahma, that person who was\ndestined to be the creator/projector of the three worlds, awoke to find himself in infinite, empty space.\nAt first he felt fear, but then he laughed at his foolishness, for there was no one there but him. Who\nwould he fear? Then he pondered his situation, attempting to comprehend it. At one point a great voice\nresounded all around him, saying a single word: \u201cTapa\u201d\u2013meaning \u201cdo tapasya.\u201d This awakened\nBrahma\u2019s memory of yoga meditation, so he began to mediate. After some time he attained full\nmemory of his past as well as the knowledge of how to create the worlds\u2013which he did. He also\nbecame established in direct perception of Brahman.\nAmong his \u201cchildren\u201d brought forth through his meditation, was Atharva, to whom he taught the way to\nrealize Brahman. \u201cIn turn Atharva taught this same knowledge of Brahman to Angi. Angi, again, taught\nit to Satyabaha, who revealed it to Angiras.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 1:1:2)\nThe essence of knowledge\nTo Angiras came upon a time Sounaka, the famous householder, and asked respectfully: \u201cHoly sir, what\nis that by which all else is known?\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 1:1:3)\nWe have already been told that the knowledge of Brahman, Brahmavidya, is the foundation of all\n\nknowledge. But Sounaka has a very salutary impatience and ambition. He wants to know what is the\none thing which, being known, causes all to be known. This is both a wise quest and a wise attitude.\nLittle Red Riding Hood ended up in the wolf\u2019s stomach because she dawdled on the way instead of\ngoing straight to her destination. If we look at the history of religions we will find that the countries\nwhich produce the most enlightened persons are those countries which have produced empires. For\nwhen such people turn to spiritual life they go after the loftiest spiritual attainments\u2013they become\nimperialists of the spirit! They seek out the most direct way\u2026and go there. Sounaka is one of them\u2013\nand hopefully so are we. Knowledge is the subject of the question, so Angiras lays a foundation for his\nanswer.\n\u201cThose who know Brahman,\u201d replied Angiras, \u201csay that there are two kinds of knowledge, the higher\nand the lower.\n\u201cThe lower is knowledge of the Vedas (the Rik, the Sama, the Yajur, and the Atharva), and also of\nphonetics, ceremonials, grammar, etymology, metre, and astronomy. The higher is knowledge of that by\nwhich one knows the changeless reality.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 1:1:4-5)\nAnalysis of knowledge\nNow we should look at this very carefully. First of all, who do we believe? When I first emerged from\nthe deadly cocoon of fundamentalist Protestantism my intellectual world was quite simple\u2013simplistic,\nactually. Fortunately I first read the Bhagavad Gita and then Autobiography of a Yogi. The next step\nwas to get out of my deadly environment, so within a few months I was on the plane to California and\nwider horizons.\nBut I discovered in a short time that wider horizons can have a drawback. I began encountering just\nabout every shade of philosophical and religious thought and attitude, most of them incompatible with\neach other. Almost daily I was told conflicting things, and always with the utmost confidence. As\nsomeone once said: \u201cThe problem with ignorance is that it picks up confidence as it goes along.\u201d I\nloved being in the wide-open mental spaces of California (and I still do), but which way should I go?\nWho could\u2013or should\u2013I trust? Since I had been shaken out of my spiritual entombment by learning of\nthe yoga tradition I wisely followed the principle that only those who know God really know anything.\nSo I sought out the teachings of illumined yogis of past and present, discarding those inauspicious\nIndian teachers who claimed to have a new revelation for a new age, and only paying attention to those\nwho were right in the center of the Eternal Dharma. (Once somebody asked me what a great yogi\u2019s\n\u201cdistinctive teachings\u201d were. \u201cNone!\u201d I replied with satisfaction. \u201cIf he taught anything \u2018new\u201d I would\nhave nothing to do with him. Truth is eternal.\u201d) I appreciated it if the English was good (and equally if\nthe book was free from typos), and expressed in a way that someone in the twentieth century like\nmyself could comprehend, but I wanted to know what all the great yogis throughout history knew: the\ntried and proven way to God.\nMy great blessing was being able to trek many times to the Vedanta Bookshop in Hollywood. There I\nfound an abundance of eternal wisdom, the same wisdom that had been flowing in a life-giving stream\nfor countless ages\u2013like the holy Ganga. The Ganga that emerges at Gangotri high in the Himalayas is\nthe same Ganga that flows into the ocean at Gangasagar. In the same way I found on the shelves of that\nlittle shop the same Sanatana Dharma spoken by the primeval sages of India. A little further east in\nHollywood at the Self-Realization Fellowship I listened every Sunday to an ideal presentation of both\nthe philosophy and spiritual practice of Eternal India. All this prepared me for India where, as a friend\nof ours once said about the same pilgrimage, \u201cI got the idea.\u201d And have treasured it ever since.\nSo those who know Brahman \u201csay that there are two kinds of knowledge, the higher and the lower.\u201d\n\nThe lower, they say, is the knowledge of scriptures, ritual, philosophic, expression and suchlike\u2013\nincluding, by the way, astrology. Please note that they do not denounce these things as useless or as\nignorance. They are definitely said to be knowledge, and a sensible person appreciates and learns them\nto a reasonable and practical degree. But it must be understood that the essential, \u201cthe higher is\nknowledge of that by which one knows the changeless reality\u201d\u2013Brahman. The knowledge which\nenables us to Know is to be sought for and prized above all else. While writing this previous sentence I\ncould clearly hear in memory the recorded voice of Yogananda saying: \u201cI walked my feet off from\nCape Cormorin to the Himalayas\u201d in search of the knowledge that would reveal God to him.\nThe lesser knowledge tells us only of that which changes, including our own short physical life. But the\nhigher knowledge brings us to the Changeless Reality. \u201cBy this is fully revealed to the wise that which\ntranscends the senses, which is uncaused, which is indefinable, which has neither eyes nor ears, neither\nhands nor feet, which is all-pervading, subtler than the subtlest\u2013the everlasting, the source of all.\u201d\n(Mundaka Upanishad 1:1:6) The Absolute Consciousness, the Totality of Being, is shown to the wise\u2013\nto the yogis\u2013by this knowledge.\nAnd the world?\nWhat about this world in which we find ourselves? Is it to be despised as worthless and antithetical to\nBrahman, our Goal? Lest we think such a foolish thing Angiras further says: \u201cAs the web comes out of\nthe spider and is withdrawn, as plants grow from the soil and hair from the body of man, so springs the\nuniverse from the eternal Brahman.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 1:1:7)\nThe world, then, is an extension or emanation of Brahman. In other words, the world IS Brahman. We\nare living and moving in divinity manifesting as the world. Why, then, do we say that the world is\nillusory? It is the world in our mind\u2013our perception, our interpretation, of the world\u2013that is an illusion,\nnot the world itself. In Indian texts we continually find the simile of the snake in a rope or a man in\ntree. That is, in darkness we see a rope lying on the ground and immediately \u201csee\u201d a snake lying there\u2013\nwe see the glitter of its eyes and may even hear it hiss! Yet, when light is brought we see only a rope.\nThe rope was always real, was always there. The snake was an illusion that existed only in our mind. In\nthe same way, walking in the darkness we may see a dead tree and mistake it for a human being, taking\nits branches for arms. We may even see the \u201carms\u201d move and think we see a face looking at us. But\nwhen we come closer we see it is only a tree\u2013and a dead one, at that. The tree was real, but the man\nwas not. Illusion is always a mental phenomenon, never a real or objective thing. So it is illusion and\nignorance we must decry, but never find fault with the world; for the world is Brahman.\nIn both instances, rope and tree, we may experience great fear. But the moment we see them for what\nthey really are, our fear evaporates and we are at peace. This is how it is with us and this world. Our\nillusions fill us with terrible fears and anxieties, all of which will be dispelled when we see its actual\nnature as Brahman. No wonder, then, that Krishna told Arjuna: \u201cEven a little of this dharma delivers\nyou from great fear.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 2:40)\nThe chain of causation\nThe sage now gives us an outline of the process of the emanation of the world from Brahman.\n\u201cBrahman willed that it should be so, and brought forth out of himself the material cause of the\nuniverse; from this came the primal energy, and from the primal energy mind, from mind the subtle\nelements, from the subtle elements the many worlds, and from the acts performed by beings in the\nmany worlds the chain of cause and effect\u2013the reward and punishment of works.\u201d (Mundaka\nUpanishad 1:1:8)\n\nCreation is also spoken of as expansions from Brahman, and that is the mode here. Brahman first\nexpands as primordial matter, than as primordial energy. From this comes the intelligence inherent in\ncreation, then the elements, and the various worlds in which they predominate. The final ingredient,\nthough, comes from the sentient beings within the universe: karma. God supplies the stage and we\nsupply the actions and reactions which unfold upon the stage.\n\u201cBrahman sees all, knows all; he is knowledge itself. Of him are born cosmic intelligence, name, form,\nand the material cause of all created beings and things.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 1:1:9) No wonder, then,\nthat in the Gita, that great digest of the upanishads, we find the words: \u201cBrahman is the ritual, Brahman\nis the offering, Brahman is he who offers to the fire that is Brahman. If a man sees Brahman in every\naction, He will find Brahman.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 4:24)\nSeeing is freeing.\n\nDelusion and Ignorance\nWe usually think of delusion and ignorance in terms of \u201cordinary\u201d life and its situations. Those who are\nmore occupied with \u201cspiritual\u201d matters assume that they are beyond such, but Angiras thinks\ndifferently, and so should we.\n\u201cFinite and transient are the fruits of sacrificial rites. The deluded, who regard them as the highest\ngood, remain subject to birth and death.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 1:2:7. Swami Prabhavananda has\nomitted verses 1 to 6 of this section as they enumerate various technical aspects of Vedic sacrifices.\nVerse seven begins the philosophical exposition of the external rites.) Swami Nikhilananda translates a\nbit more literally: \u201cFrail indeed are those rafts of sacrifices, therefore they are destructible. Fools who\nrejoice in them as the Highest Good fall victims again and again to old age and death.\u201d \u201cBack they\nmust turn to the mortal pathway, subject still to birth and to dying,\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 9:3) says the Gita\non the same subject.\nKarma and religion\nI think just about everybody puts karma into two lumps: Good Karma and Bad Karma. But that is not\nvery satisfactory. Karma, like all of life, has many nuances and can vary greatly. Some karma, for\nexample, creates more karma, and some actually dissolves karma. For example, Sri Ramakrishna said\nthat all spiritual practices are part of Karma Yoga, but they deliver us from karma. There are material,\nmental, and spiritual karmas. The material and mental karmas impel us to more of the same, whether\ngood or bad. But spiritual karma enables us to rise above the material and mental planes and free\nourselves from karmic bondage.\nAngiras wants us to understand that religious karma is not always spiritual. This should not surprise us\nwhen we can readily see that most religion is based on material goals. \u201cStuff\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d just\nabout sums up the motives of all the religions of the world, including that of modern India. As a result,\nmost religious acts culminate in more mental and psychological involvement, not freedom. In the\nverses omitted by Swami Prabhavananda it is pointed out that most religion creates karma that takes us\nto heaven\u2013and then dumps us back on earth when our \u201cmerit\u201d is used up. So we end back where we\nstarted. What a gyp.\nJust because a religious act is either directed toward God or offered to God does not mean it will\nultimately lead to God. Usually it leads us away from God into the labyrinth of relative existence in\nsome form or other. Since most people have been cultivating a taste for earthly things through life after\nlife, this suits them. But it should gall us, and we should refuse the pursuit and get off the merry-go-\n\nround.\nGreat suffering\nSo there are aspects of religion we should avoid adamantly. Otherwise: \u201cLiving in the abyss of\nignorance, yet wise in their own conceit, the deluded go round and round, like the blind led by the\nblind.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 1:2:8) \u201cThey be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind,\nboth shall fall into the ditch,\u201d (Matthew 15:14) said Jesus, surely having this verse in mind.\nSwami Gambhirananda\u2019s translation points out a sad aspect of all this: \u201cRemaining within the fold of\nignorance, and thinking, \u2018We are ourselves wise and learned,\u2019 the fools, while being buffeted very\nmuch, ramble about like the blind led by the blind alone.\u201d Buffeted very much. (\u201cBeing afflicted by\nmany ills\u201d is the translation of Swami Nikhilananda.) How true. Promising others the cessation of all\ntroubles and sorrows, these religious mountebanks are more afflicted than ordinary people. Whether\nthis is from the negative karma accruing from their dishonesty or a manifestation of their own inner\ndiseases, the result is the same. \u201cWhile they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of\ncorruption,\u201d (II Peter 2:19) as Saint Peter put it.\nYou have better ways to spend your time, so I will not recount to you the observations of over sixty\nyears in which I have seen such hucksters and their dupes literally undergoing \u201cthe sufferings of the\ndamned.\u201d And all the while they denounce those taking another path as \u201cdeluded\u201d and \u201cof the devil.\u201d\nWell, as Jesus said: \u201cThey have their reward.\u201d (Matthew 6:2, 5, 16) And they must like it, for they\ncertainly cling to it.\nSuch is the grave danger of externalized religion.\nGreat delusion\nAs I say, they love and cling to their miserable condition. As the upanishad continues: \u201cLiving in the\nabyss of ignorance, the deluded think themselves blest. Attached to works, they know not God. Works\nlead them only to heaven, whence, to their sorrow, their rewards quickly exhausted, they are flung back\nto earth.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 1:2:9)\nThen the heart of the matter is revealed in the next verse: \u201cConsidering religion to be observance of\nrituals and performance of acts of charity, the deluded remain ignorant of the highest good. Having\nenjoyed in heaven the reward of their good works, they enter again into the world of mortals.\u201d\n(Mundaka Upanishad 1:2:10)\nRituals of worship and good deeds certainly produce good karma, but that is not the force that lifts us\nabove samsara, the ever-turning wheel of birth and death. If our religion consists only of outer\nobservances it will condition our consciousness even more to identify with the material level of\nexistence. And that identification will be a round-trip ticket for our return to another birth after another\ndeath!\nEven helping others is spiritually valueless if it is not done with a wider, spiritual perspective. One of\nthe hallmarks of today\u2019s ineffectual religion is its obsessive involvement in social action and reform.\nWhen we look at the lives of saints we see they were the most generous of people, even sacrificing\nthemselves for others. But they did these things not as their religion, but as an expression of their love\nfor God and His children\u2013which is the true religion.\nWe must not \u201cremain ignorant of the highest good,\u201d but must seek that Highest Good within through\nmeditation and the cultivation of spiritual consciousness even outside meditation. Unless we do this we\n\nwill find ourselves shuttled right back to earth on completion of our good \u201cheaven karma.\u201d\n\nWisdom and Truth\nThe wise\nNo one likes to be thought stupid, and all like to be thought intelligent. Even better is it to be thought\nwise. Of course, in all ages there have been the fools that preferred to be \u201ccool\u201d or \u201csharp\u201d or \u201cneat\u201d or\nsuch idiotic expressions. The sad thing is that the vast majority want to be thought of as smart or wise,\nbut only a small percentage care whether they really are smart or wise. The upanishad is meant for\nthese latter people, so the sage continues: \u201cBut wise, self-controlled, and tranquil souls, who are\ncontented in spirit, and who practice austerity and meditation in solitude and silence, are freed from all\nimpurity, and attain by the path of liberation to the immortal, the truly existing, the changeless Self.\u201d\n(Mundaka Upanishad 1:2:11)\nLet us look at the traits of the wise. They are disciplined, and so are self-controlled. As a result of their\ndiscipline they have become peaceful. Intent on spiritual development, giving priority to the spirit, they\nhave become contented\u2013for outside the spirit there is no peace or tranquility. This means that they are\nharmonious and balanced, as well. They continually engage in those disciplines which purify them, and\nby being so purified they are capable of becoming adept in meditation. As a result of these qualities\nthey are firmly on the path to liberation, and shall without doubt attain to the Self which is the only\ntruly existing thing, changeless and sure from eternity.\nSome adjectives\nNow a look at some Sanskrit terms will be helpful to us.\nThe wise are said to be aranye\u2013living in the forest. At the time of the Gita, many serious sadhakas lived\non the outskirts of towns, preferring to live in the wooded areas where neighbors would not be visible,\neven if somewhat near. This ideal is found twice in the Gita: \u201cTurn all your thought toward solitude,\nspurning the noise of the crowd, its fruitless commotion.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 13:10) And: \u201cWhen a man\nseeks solitude,\u2026ever engaged in his meditation on Brahman,\u2026that man is ready for oneness with\nBrahman.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 18:52, 53) It is not a matter of surrounding vegetation, but the inward\nwithdrawal from outer association that is being praised here. Even in a crowded city we can live in \u201cthe\nforest\u201d of inner solitude. In the thirteenth chapter of Autobiography of a Yogi, the master yogi, Ram\nGopal Muzumdar, asked Yogananda: \u201cAre you able to have a little room where you can close the door\nand be alone?\u201d When he said that he did have such a room, the saint told him: \u201cThat is your cave. That\nis your sacred mountain. That is where you will find the kingdom of God.\u201d Though that is so, still the\naspiring yogi should be extremely sparing of social contacts, and then only with those who benefit him\nspiritually.\nThe first words of this verse in Sanskrit describe the wise as tapahshraddhe\u2013an interesting fusion of\ntapasya and shraddha\u2013ascetic discipline and faith\u2013shraddha in this instance meaning aspiration more\nthan faith. Many people engage in spiritual practice for the wrong reasons, but the right one is a\nconfidence in one\u2019s ability to attain self-realization. Tapah literally means to generate heat, so\ntapahshraddha can also mean heat-generating faith or aspiration, that which heats us up, builds the\nproverbial fire under us, gets us moving and keeps us moving. Tapasya is the energy generator of the\nwise directed by their assurance that the Goal exists and is within grasp. Tapahshraddha is the radiance\n(tejas) that fills the proficient yogi. In the Chandogya Upanishad, when a young man returns from a\nlong period of tapasya, his teacher said to him: \u201c\u201cMy son, your face shines like one who knows\nBrahman.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad4:14:2) This is the effect of tapahshraddha.\n\nThe wise are vidvamsah\u2013learned. They not only practice, they study and learn and assimilate what they\nhave learned. There is no place in spiritual life for pious ignorance. Sentimental dummies are not\n\u201cdevotees,\u201d they are fools. And fools do not find God. It is very true that many people get what\nYogananda called \u201cintellectual indigestion\u201d from reading loads of theories and trivia. But the wise\ncarefully choose books of spiritual wisdom such as scriptures, lives of holy people, and the\nwritings/teachings of those who possess genuine inner illumination. Such books can never do anything\nbut good. It is especially necessary to read the teachings of realized yogis. (I am not talking about\nsuper-gurus, glitter-gurus, and empire-building gurus, but real Masters of the spiritual life.) Naturally,\nthey will have to use their own good sense as to whose words are worthwhile and whose are worthless\nor even poisonous. They will not have a library of thousands of books, I assure you. But they will have\na goodly number of spiritual gems which they will perpetually read and ponder daily. Certainly they\nwill not spend hours a day on reading, but they will allot an appropriate amount of time for it. Fake\nteachers and cults hate what I have just written, insisting that \u201cloyal\u201d and \u201cin tune\u201d cultists will read\nnothing but what the cult authorizes, so the dupes will not \u201cget confused.\u201d This only reveals their\npredatory cruelty. Their \u201cprotection\u201d of their \u201csheep\u201d is nothing less than the \u201cprotective custody\u201d of\nthe Nazi death camps. They fear that if their followers become informed as to the real nature of\ntraditional philosophy and yoga they will realize they are being lied to, and will sensibly go elsewhere\nand find real truth. And that is bad for business.\nNow comes an interesting adjective: virajah\u2013beyond (free from) rajas. This may seem odd, but those of\nyou who have been yogis for some years will remember how at the beginning of your \u201cyoga days\u201d you\nwere very rajasic in your approach. First of all, you wanted to tell everyone about it, and you went\naround accumulating \u201cspiritual stuff\u201d of all kinds. You really began to star in your own spiritual movie,\nand you made quite an epic. Your motives were perfectly all right, even laudable, but they were rajasic,\nfilled with activity and \u201cpassion\u201d for getting on to the Goal. Again, the intentions were good, but the\nfeverishness and externalization was not. For a lot of people, when the rajas fizzles out so does their\nimpetus toward God. Most abandon any form of spiritual life, while others settle down to a comfortable\nand ineffectual life in some yoga cult that makes them feel secure and one of the \u201cchosen.\u201d But what is\nneeded is for the rajasic heat to mutate into the steady warmth and radiance of sattwa. Then the\naspiration and involvement actually increases, but in a fully effectual way, an increasingly interior way.\nSpiritual life changes over from a compulsion to an intelligent choice. Spiritual restlessness becomes\nsteadiness in spiritual practice and development. God is no longer the brass ring to strain at but an everpresent Reality whose perception keeps on increasing in a naturally supernatural way.\nAnd the result of all this? The upanishad says: \u201cprayanti suryadvarena,\u201d which Shankara says means:\n\u201cthey move superbly [skillfully] along the path of the sun.\u201d That is, they ascend steadily and skillfully\nto the solar world, the realm of the Self-existent Light that is Brahman.\n\nGetting in Perspective\nMany things are needed in life, but none more important than an overview, a perspective on the values\nof life. This is true for everyone, so the sage now speaks of it in a spiritual context.\n\u201cLet a man devoted to spiritual life examine carefully the ephemeral nature of such enjoyment, whether\nhere or hereafter, as may be won by good works, and so realize that it is not by works that one gains the\nEternal. Let him give no thought to transient things, but, absorbed in meditation, let him renounce the\nworld. If he would know the Eternal, let him humbly approach a Guru devoted to Brahman and wellversed in the scriptures.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 1:2:12)\nThis needs to be looked at bit by bit.\n\nLet a man devoted to spiritual life examine carefully the ephemeral nature of such enjoyment, whether\nhere or hereafter, as may be won by good works, and so realize that it is not by works that one gains\nthe Eternal. Back in high school I came across an eighteenth-century collection of humor and satire. I\nhave forgotten most of it, but there was one story about a man who fell in love with a woman he often\nsaw at the theater. That was when all lighting came from candles, and in that light she looked\nstunningly beautiful. He got the courage to ask her if he could visit her at home in the daytime. She\nagreed, and in the daylight he saw that she was horrible-looking, incredibly old, wore a wig and loads\nof make-up. He fell out of love instantly! It is the same with this and all other worlds and the\nenjoyments they offer in return for good karma. It is all deathly illusion. What we need is the light of\nspiritual day.\nSeeing the world clearly is the only lasting antidote for the poison of worldliness. First we approach the\nmatter intellectually. Just the fact of inevitable death should begin to turn us from attachment, and the\nfact that nothing lasts should seal our disillusionment. Yet, old habits do indeed die hard, and there is no\nhabit as strongly entrenched as attraction to the world and its promises. So discipline is needed.\nLet him give no thought to transient things. The wise aspirant must exert his will and refuse to even\ngive a thought to the \u201cgood things\u201d offered by the world, \u201cgood things\u201d that will melt away in time, and\nthat often prove to be anything but good. Look at those that have worldly success. Misery and\nconfusion is their daily bread, but those who envy them are convinced that they alone have found the\nway to happiness. We must in contrast refuse to even look at the mirages held out to us by the world\nand our own habit-deluded mind. How will we cure the mind of its awful addictions? By being\u2026\nAbsorbed in meditation. For meditation cures the fevers of the mind and heart and dispels the\nhallucinations produced by illusions and desires. The only way to be absorbed in meditation is to be\nconstantly cultivating interior consciousness even outside of meditation. Our whole life must become a\nmeditation process.\nLet him renounce the world. The Sanskrit word nirvedam does not really mean renunciation, though\nmany translators use that term. Actually, nirvedam means being indifferent, not being influenced or\nmoved by something\u2013in this case the world and its ways. It is an inner state, a condition of the mind\nvery akin to the non-arising (nirodha) of mental reactions (vrittih) spoken about in the Yoga Sutras as\nbeing the state of yoga. \u201cWhen your intellect has cleared itself of its delusions, you will become\nindifferent to the results of all action, present or future.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 2:52) And consequently you\nwill be indifferent to the actions that produce those results as well as the world-stage on which their\ndramas are enacted. None of this occurs just for the asking or wishing, so Angiras give us practical\nadvice:\nIf he would know the Eternal, let him humbly approach a Guru devoted to Brahman and well-versed in\nthe scriptures. The ideal of the upanishads often differs from that of later Indian thought which is not\nbased on wisdom but on whimsy\u2013and often on theatrical effect. Today there is a lot of talk about how\nvalueless a teacher is who only knows the scriptures but has no inner realization, and how wonderful is\nthe illiterate\u2013or one who is ignorant of the scriptures\u2013but who has spiritual knowledge. This is silly.\nFirst of all, a scholar can tell you what the great masters of the spiritual life taught in the scriptures, and\nyou can learn from them just as you would if they were still on earth. You cannot get spirituality from\nbooks, it is true, but you can get spiritual instruction that will lead to the acquisition of spirituality. On\nthe other hand, what kind of a person, supposedly intent on gaining spiritual knowledge, will choose to\nremain ignorant? Consider Sri Ramana Maharshi. He had no interest in academic matters, but after\ngoing to Arunachala and attaining realization he became a living library of countless spiritual texts,\nhaving read widely in several languages. So the sage tells us that a worthy teacher has a thorough\n\nknowledge of the holy writings and is also Brahmanishtham\u2013established in the experiential knowledge\nof Brahman.\nSuch a teacher is rare, but we should accept no lesser teacher. If we find such a one we must learn all\nwe can and then apply it. If we cannot find one, then we should diligently study the words of realized\nmasters and follow them. The Mahayana Buddhists say a very wonderful thing: Whenever someone\nresolves to seek enlightenment a host of buddhas and bodhisattwas immediately become aware of it\nand begin blessing and guiding him. Real masters never die, so we can become their disciples no matter\nhow long ago they lived in a physical body. This is especially true of three great Masters who both\nteach and save even now: Krishna, Buddha, and Jesus. One who sincerely, with right intention, takes\nrefuge in them and prays for guidance will find they respond. Such a one will need to act on what he\nalready knows if he hopes to gain further understanding. And if he is wise he will assiduously avoid all\nthose who claim to be their representatives or intermediaries.\n\u201cTo a disciple who approaches reverently, who is tranquil and self-controlled, the wise teacher gives\nthat knowledge, faithfully and without stint, by which is known the truly existing, the changeless Self.\u201d\n(Mundaka Upanishad 1:2:13) By these words we know the qualified student and the qualified teacher.\nWhen the two come together the result is Perfect Knowing.\n\nOrigin and Return\n\u201cThe Imperishable is the Real. As sparks innumerable fly upward from a blazing fire, so from the\ndepths of the Imperishable arise all things. To the depths of the Imperishable they in turn descend.\u201d\n(Mundaka Upanishad 2:1:1) This is a spectacular simile\u2013mostly because it happens to be the absolute\ntruth. But a more literal translation brings out some important points Prabhavananda decided to pass\nover. Here is Swami Nikhilananda\u2019s rendering: \u201cAs from a blazing fire, sparks essentially akin to it fly\nforth by the thousand, so also, my good friend, do various beings come forth from the imperishable\nBrahman and unto Him again return.\u201d Swami Gambhirananda, the saintly President of Ramakrishna\nMission, translated it this way: \u201cAs from a fire, fully ablaze, fly off sparks, in their thousands, that are\nakin to the fire, similarly from the Immutable originate different kinds of creatures and into It again\nthey merge.\u201d\nThree prime truths\nThere are three points being made here that are the bedrock of upanishadic philosophy. First, all beings\nthat exist\u2013past, present, future\u2013are of the same nature, even the same substance, as Brahman. Second,\nall forms (modes of existence), though ever-changing, proceed from the Unchanging, Unchangeable.\nThis seeming contradiction is made possible by the illusory power of Maya. That is, the changing\nforms are illusory while the essential being, the Self/Atman is unchanging. Third, having come from\nBrahman they shall all, without exception return to Brahman. When life is viewed this way we can\nunderstand its nature and purpose, and live accordingly. For the upanishads are not interested in giving\nus empty theory without a practical application.\nSome traits of the Source\n\u201cSelf-luminous is that Being, and formless. He dwells within all and without all. He is unborn, pure,\ngreater than the greatest, without breath, without mind.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:1:2) Pervading all,\nboth Brahman and the Atman are yet untouched by any forms in which they dwell, knowing themselves\nthrough themselves\u2013self-luminous. Both the internal and the external are permeated with the presence\nof Conscious Spirit. Although the forms floating on the surface of the Ocean of Being are born,\nconditioned, endowed with mind and senses, and compelled to \u201clive\u201d as a consequence of the sowing\n\nand reaping of karma in previous lives, in reality none of this takes place in an absolute, objective\nsense. Rather, it is the power of Maya that produces these appearances. As the Gita says: \u201cHelpless all,\nfor Maya is their master\u2026.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 9:8) Yet, the sage is telling us in this upanishad that,\nalmighty as Maya seems to be, Spirit is \u201cgreater than the greatest.\u201d When we are sunk in delusion, then\nMaya seems the most powerful, but when we transfer our conscious into spirit, then we find that the\nSelf is always the master of Maya, on the universal and the individual levels.\nAgain, Brahman is the Source: \u201cFrom him are born breath, mind, the organs of sense, ether, air, fire,\nwater, and the earth, and he binds all these together.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:1:3) God\u2019s \u201ccreation\u201d is\nnever separated from Him for an instant. By His indwelling presence He maintains and unifies them.\nAll that exists is held in the Mind of God, for they are His thoughts made visible or tangible.\n\u201cHeaven is his head, the sun and moon his eyes, the four quarters his ears, the revealed scriptures his\nvoice, the air his breath, the universe his heart. From his feet came the earth. He is the innermost Self of\nall.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:1:4) The universe is not really God\u2019s creation, it is His manifestation\u2013His\n\u201cincarnation.\u201d And he remains its Inner Controller (Antaryamin).\n\u201cFrom him arises the sun-illumined sky, from the sky the rain, from the rain food, and from food the\nseed in man which he gives to woman. Thus do all creatures descend from him.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad\n2:1:5) Though this differs from her style of expression, it reminds me of great wisdom spoken by Mary\nBaker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science. She said that in reality we all come from God, but we\nignore the fact. We say: \u201cEverybody in my family gets\u2026\u201d and then name some disease or negative\ncondition. We think it is \u201cgenetics\u201d that must manifest. But our real genes are Divine Qualities. Why do\nwe not believe they will manifest in us? Our father and mother were adult human beings, and we\nbecame the same. The ultimate Father/Mother is God, so why do we neglect the development of Divine\nConsciousness? Divinity is our only true nature.\n\u201cFrom him are born hymns, devotional chants, scriptures, rites, sacrifices, oblations, divisions of time,\nthe doer and the deed, and all the worlds lighted by the sun and purified by the moon.\u201d (Mundaka\nUpanishad 2:1:6) You cannot get more complete than that!\n\u201cFrom him are born gods of diverse descent. From him are born angels, men, beasts, birds; from him\nvitality, and food to sustain it; from him austerity and meditation, faith, truth, continence, and law.\u201d\n(Mundaka Upanishad 2:1:7) It is this last part that is of special meaning for us. We are told that\nausterity (tapasya), meditation, faith, truth, continence, and law arise from God. They are the presence\nof God manifesting in our life and through us to the world. Who, then, can be more beneficial to the\nworld than a yogi? The word vidhi, translated \u201claw,\u201d means both instruction and method. There is an\ninnate order in the universe which each of us should embody. It is not learned intellectually but is\nintuited by the yogi. The yogi will then order his life accordingly\u2013methodically. Of course the supreme\nmethod is the method of meditation itself.\n\u201cFrom him spring the organs, of sense, their activities, and their objects, together with their awareness\nof these objects. All these things, parts of man\u2019s nature, spring from him.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:1:8)\nThis explains how human beings are \u201cmade in the image of God.\u201d\n\u201cIn him the seas and the mountains have their source; from him spring the rivers, and from him the\nherbs and other life-sustaining elements, by the aid of which the subtle body of man subsists in the\nphysical body.\n\u201cThus Brahman is all in all. He is action, knowledge, goodness supreme. To know him, hidden in the\nlotus of the heart, is to untie the knot of ignorance.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:1:9, 10)\n\nKnowing God\nAbout God\nFurther description of Brahman is now to be given along with instructions on how to know Brahman.\nThe upanishad is so clear, and the concepts have been referred to before, so some verses hardly need\nmore than a sentence of comment.\n\u201cSelf-luminous is Brahman, ever present in the hearts of all. He is the refuge of all, he is the supreme\ngoal. In him exists all that moves and breathes. In him exists all that is. He is both that which is gross\nand that which is subtle. Adorable is he. Beyond the ken of the senses is he. Supreme is he. Attain thou\nhim!\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:2:1) The last part is the most important. What value is it to know about\nGod if we do not go to God? Saint Silouan of Athos used to say that theology is the false mysticism of\nthe ego, for people become satisfied, or even fascinated, with philosophical concepts that are nothing\nbut bare words. Rare are those who want to experience the things they believe. In many instances it\nmay be that people intuit the untruth of their religious beliefs and subconsciously know that they cannot\nbe experienced. But it is sad to see those that have come to understand the concepts of karma,\nreincarnation, and evolution of consciousness still dawdling along with the theorists instead of getting\non to the Goal.\n\u201cHe, the self-luminous, subtler than the subtlest, in whom exist all the worlds and all those that live\ntherein\u2013he is the imperishable Brahman. He is the principle of life. He is speech, and he is mind. He is\nreal. He is immortal. Attain him, O my friend, the one goal to be attained!\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:2:2)\nNot only must we attain God, we must understand while striving that He is the only goal to be attained\u2013\nfor everything else is antithetical to our eternal nature.\nThe means to reach God\nHaving hopefully convinced us of the value of seeking God (!) the sage is going to tell us how to find\nGod by telling us the actual means: \u201cAffix to the Upanishad, the bow incomparable, the sharp arrow of\ndevotional worship; then, with mind absorbed and heart melted in love, draw the arrow and hit the\nmark\u2013the imperishable Brahman. OM is the bow, the arrow is the individual being, and Brahman is the\ntarget. With a tranquil heart, take aim. Lose thyself in him, even as the arrow is lost in the target.\u201d\n(Mundaka Upanishad 2:2:3, 4)\nHere is Swami Gambhirananda\u2019s more literal version: \u201cTaking hold of the bow, that is the Great\nWeapon familiar in the Upanishads, one should fix on it an arrow, sharpened with meditation. Drawing\nthe string with a mind absorbed in Its thought, hit that very target that is the Immutable. Om is the bow;\nthe soul [atma] is the arrow; and Brahman is called its target. It is to be hit by an unerring man. One\nshould become one with It just like an arrow.\u201d This is really a description of meditation, so each point\nis significant.\nTaking hold of the bow (Om is the bow). Right away we are being given a most valuable instruction in\nmeditation. We \u201ctake hold\u201d of Om by intoning It within. Our practice must not be passive, but calmly\nactive\u2013we are always to be in charge by taking hold of Om and applying it in meditation through the\ngeneration of subtle sound. (See Om Yoga, Its Theory and Practice.) The active character of Om is\nindicated by Its being called a bow, for a bow impels the arrow to its target. It is a matter of strength, of\npower. In the Rig Veda we find the Gayatri Mantra, a great prayer for enlightenment: \u201cWe meditate on\nthe Spiritual Effulgence of that Supreme Divine Reality. May That impel us toward It.\u201d Om is the force\nthat impels us toward Divinity.\n\nThat is the Great Weapon familiar in the Upanishads. Om is not just a weapon among many, It is the\nGreat Weapon for conquering ignorance that is referred to throughout the Upanishads. This is not a\nmatter of opinion or discussion. In the eleven basic upanishads, the Gita, and the Yoga Sutras the only\nmantra recommended is Om, and the only meditation set forth is the meditation on Om. An honest\nperusal of these texts will reveal that this is neither an exaggeration nor a wishful interpretation.\nAlthough the wisdom of these sacred texts has been almost totally ignored for past centuries, their truth\nis not to be denied by any who ascribe to Sanatana Dharma. It is departing from the upanishadic\nphilosophy that has resulted in the confused mess of contemporary Hinduism, the worst of it aspects\nbeing the treacherous and destructive idolatry of Gurudom. Because of this aberration people have\naccepted a myriad substitutes for the upanishadic truth on the basis of \u201cguru bhakti\u201d and \u201cfaith in the\nguru.\u201d The resulting confusion is obvious to those not drowning in it themselves.\nOne should fix on it an arrow, sharpened with meditation (the Self is the arrow). Our very Self, our\nvery consciousness, is to be united with Om in calm and whole-hearted attention. This can only be\ndone by being \u201cpurified by constant meditation\u201d according to Shankara\u2019s commentary. So meditation is\nitself the way to become proficient in meditation. The simple fact that we are meditating is assurance\nthat we shall become more and more proficient in it. When that proficiency is gained, then we will\neasily unite our consciousness with Om.\nDrawing the string with a mind absorbed in Its thought. Through constant meditation we develop the\nability to fill our awareness with the inner intonations of Om which act like the string of a bow to the\nmind that is fixed on It.\nHit that very target that is the Immutable (Brahman). We do not start out small and work up to bigger\nthings. From the first we aim at Brahman. By means of this determination Brahman alone will be\nrealized by us without wandering into the psychic byways that can confuse and delude the wandering\nmeditator who does not know the method of the upanishads.\nIt is to be hit by an unerring man. The idea here is that the one who can successfully \u201chit\u201d the target of\nBrahman is one who has no distractions or waverings, whose mind remains firmly established in the\njapa and meditation of Om. There is a kind of parable about this in the Mahabharata. In Yoga As A\nUniversal Science, Swami Krishnananda tells it this way:\n\u201cThose who are familiar with the Mahabharata know the story of the tournament arranged by Acharya\nDrona for the Pandavas and the Kauravas. The test of concentration which Dronacharya arranged for\nthose boys was like this. There was a tree with many branches. In one fine twig, he hung a wooden\nbird. The eye of the bird was looking like a black spot, and that eye was to be shot by the arrow. So he\nasked the boys: \u2018Concentrate yourself on the eye of that bird and hit it. Look! What do you see?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019\none said, \u2018well, I see a bird sitting on the tree.\u2019 Dronacharya said, \u2018You are unfit. You are not able to\nconcentrate.\u2019 Then he asked another, \u2018What do you see?\u2019 \u2018I see the bird sitting on the branch.\u2019 \u2018No, you\nare not able to concentrate.\u2019 Then he asked Yudhishthira, \u2018What do you see?\u2019 \u2018I see only the eye.\u2019 \u2018No.\nNo good,\u2019 he said. He asked Arjuna. Arjuna said, \u2018I see only the black spot. I see nothing else.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\nyou are the man\u2019 said Dronacharya, \u2018Hit it!\u2019 Arjuna\u2019s concentration was so intense that he could see\nonly the black spot. He could not see even the eye of the bird there, let alone the bird and the tree and\nthe people around. That was Arjuna.\u201d And that must be us. It may take time, but it nonetheless must\ncome about.\nOne should become one with It just like an arrow. The arrow embeds itself in the target and becomes\none with it. This is not an occasional ascent to higher awareness, but a permanent establishment in the\nBeing of Brahman. It is meditation on Om that can accomplish this.\n\nWhat we will perceive in that union\nAs a result of our meditation we shall directly perceive: \u201cIn him are woven heaven, earth, and sky,\ntogether with the mind and all the senses. Know him, the Self alone. Give up vain talk. He is the bridge\nof immortality.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:2:5) This verse actually refers to Om, and literally says: \u201cOn\nthat [Om] are strung heaven, earth, space, the mind and all the senses. It alone is the sole support of all.\nHaving known the Self [through Om] discard other speech [or mantras] and their results. For this [Om]\nis the bridge to immortality.\u201d That is a bit different! Om is the all-encompassing Reality from which all\nthings have come. It alone leads us back to Immortality. Om should be our continual\u2013and in meditation\nour only\u2013thought insofar as it is possible and practical.\nWhere we find God\n\u201cOh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!\u201d (Job 23:3 ) lamented the\nBiblical Job. If he had access to the upanishads as we do, he would have found the answer in the next\nverse:\n\u201cWithin the lotus of the heart he dwells, where, like the spokes of a wheel in its hub, the nerves meet.\nMeditate on him as OM. Easily mayest thou cross the sea of darkness.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:2:6)\nGambhirananda: \u201cWith that [hub] in which are fixed the nerves [nadis] like the spokes on the hub of a\nchariot wheel, moves this aforesaid Self by becoming multiformed. Meditate on the Self thus with the\nhelp of Om. My you be free from hindrances in going to the other shore beyond darkness.\u201d\nAt the core of all our manifest existence there moves the immortal Spirit-self which has assumed all the\nforms and aspects we call \u201cus.\u201d Although these numberless veils hide the Self from our present vision,\nwe can meditate on it by the means of Om. This will remove all obstacles and carry us safely over the\nheaving waves of samsara into the harbor of Spirit. As Patanjali says regarding Om: \u201cIts constant\nrepetition and meditation is the way. From it result the disappearance of obstacles and the turning\ninward of consciousness.\u201d The same thing is said in the Varaha and Yoga Tattwa (B) Upanishads.\nMore about the heart\nWhen the upanishads speak of the \u201cheart\u201d they do not mean the physical organ that pumps blood, but\nthe center of our being where the Self ever dwells. The sage now speaks more about this spiritual heart.\n\u201cThis Self, who understands all, who knows all, and whose glory is manifest in the universe, lives\nwithin the lotus of the heart, the bright throne of Brahman. By the pure in heart is he known. The Self\nexists in man, within the lotus of the heart, and is the master of his life and of his body. With mind\nillumined by the power of meditation, the wise know him, the blissful, the immortal.\u201d (Mundaka\nUpanishad 2:2:7) There is a great deal to learn from this verse.\nSince the Self understands and knows all, to be truly knowledgous and wise all we need do is shift our\nawareness into our own Self.\nAlthough the Self should not be identified with external things such as our body or the world,\nnevertheless, the glory of our Self\u2013including the Supreme Self\u2013is manifested in our own private\nuniverse and the greater universe as well. We can come to perceive spiritual realities hidden within the\nmaterial illusions.\nThe Self abides in the core of our being\u2013not in the physical heart. According to the great yogis, we can\nspeak of the thousand-petalled lotus of the brain as our spiritual \u201cheart,\u201d especially the very core of the\nbrain, the cave-like area within which the pineal gland is located. This is sometimes called the\n\nChidakasha, the Space of Consciousness. Both God and the individual Self dwell there. In the Sanskrit\ntext there is the expression Brahmapuri\u2013the City of God\u2013used for this spiritual heart. It further says that\nGod and the Self are known by centering our awareness in this heart.\nIt is meditation which illumines the mind and enables us to see and know this blissful, immortal Self all\naround us, in everything. This is living!\n\u201cThe knot of the heart, which is ignorance, is loosed, all doubts are dissolved, all evil effects of deeds\nare destroyed, when he who is both personal and impersonal is realized.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:2:8)\nWhen we enter into the consciousness of our individual spirit and the Infinite Spirit, the blinding veil of\nignorance will dissolve away along with all the bonds of karma.\n\u201cIn the effulgent lotus of the heart dwells Brahman, who is passionless and indivisible. He is pure, he is\nthe light of lights. Him the knowers of the Self attain.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2:2:9) What greater goal\ncan we have than this?\nThe Light of lights\nIn summation of this section, the sage says:\n\u201cHim the sun does not illumine, nor the moon, nor the stars, nor the lightning\u2013nor, verily, fires kindled\nupon the earth. He is the one light that gives light to all. He shining, everything shines.\n\u201cThis immortal Brahman is before, this immortal Brahman is behind, this immortal Brahman extends to\nthe right and to the left, above and below. Verily, all is Brahman, and Brahman is supreme.\u201d (Mundaka\nUpanishad 2:2:10, 11)\nThese thrilling words need no comment\u2013only response.\n\nThe Two Selves\nCross-eyed people see a single object as two. In the same way the ignorant see the One as many. Yet,\nthere is a perverse spiritual cross-eyedness which works just the opposite, making its victims see two as\none. This is the disease of half-baked Vedanta that is merely conceptual and not based on the\nexperience that only yoga imparts. There is no such thing as a genuine Vedantist who is not first and\nforemost a Yogi. Anyway, the upanishad is now going to give us the right understanding of the\nParamatman and the jivatman\u2013the Supreme Self and the individual Self\u2013their unity and their\ndistinction, and their relationship with each other. Here, too, only the yogi will really understand what\nis being said.\n\u201cLike two birds of golden plumage, inseparable companions, the individual self and the immortal Self\nare perched on the branches of the selfsame tree. The former tastes of the sweet and bitter fruits of the\ntree; the latter, tasting of neither, calmly observes.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:1:1) This is a case where\nthe Sanskrit original gives very precise information which is necessary for us to carefully peruse.\nOtherwise we will miss some remarkable truths.\nThree qualities\nThis verse gives us three words in relation to the two \u201cbirds\u201d\u2013the two Selves: suparna, sayuja, and\nsakhaya. Suparna means intimately related, the idea being that the individual Self and the Cosmic Self\nexist in an eternal relation. Sayuja means being in a state of union\u2013perpetual union, as Shankara points\nout in his commentary. A secondary meaning of sayuja is being in the same place\u2013that the two Selves\n\nare inseparable, are ever present to one another. According to Shankara, the third expression, sakhaya,\nmeans that the two Selves have the identical name or designation, and exists in an identical manner.\nThe upanishads say that Om is the name or designator of them both and that they possess the same\nqualities\u2013one in an absolute degree and the other in a limited degree. Sakhaya also means\ncompanionship and friendship, indicating the deep personal relation between the jivatman and\nParamatman.\nThe \u201cselfsame tree\u201d is the body\u2013and by extension, the cosmos. The form of every sentient being has\ntwo indwellers\u2013the two Selves. However, they do not have the same experience of the tree. The\nindividual, the jiva, \u201ctastes\u201d the fruit of the tree in the form of the inner and outer senses, and according\nto the quality of that experience is made happy, unhappy, contented, discontented\u2013and so forth. The\nindividual \u201cundergoes\u201d experience. The Supreme Self, on the other hand, \u201ctasting of neither [sweet or\nbitter experiences], calmly observes.\u201d God experiences being in all forms and is aware of all that the\nindividual spirit experiences, yet, as a more literal translation says, He \u201clooks on without eating\u201d\u2013\nwithout being affected or conditioned by it. But he does know exactly the effect and conditioning that\naccrues to the individual Self. He is experiencing right along with us, but unlike us is not pulled into a\nmistaken identity with the body-mind and its experiences.\nThe problem and the solution\nOn the other hand: \u201cThe individual self, deluded by forgetfulness of his identity with the divine Self,\nbewildered by his ego, grieves and is sad. But when he recognizes the worshipful Lord as his own true\nSelf, and beholds his glory, he grieves no more.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:1:2) This is quite interpretive,\nthough correctly so. The literal translation of Swami Gambhirananda is: \u201cOn the same tree, the\nindividual soul remains drowned, as it were; and so it moans, being worried by its impotence. When it\nsees thus the other, the adored Lord, and His glory, then it becomes liberated from sorrow.\u201d We are\ndrowned, submerged, in the deadly ocean of samsara, of continual birth, death, unsurety, pain, and\nconfusion. Shankara points out that the individual is overwhelmed with confusion because it cannot\nunderstand what is really happening to it, and why. Just like a piece of driftwood on the heaving sea, it\nis lifted up and down, thrown onto the shore and then pulled out to sea again. So it grieves at its\nhelplessness and hopelessness.\nAll is changed, though, when the individual sees, right in the core of its being, the very God it has been\nhitherto worshipping as separate from itself. Experiencing within its own being the presence and the\nglory of God\u2013and thereby realizing that glory as his own\u2013the individual becomes liberated from\nsorrow.\nThe sage elaborates on this, continuing: \u201cWhen the seer beholds the Effulgent One, the Lord, the\nSupreme Being, then, transcending both good and evil, and freed from impurities, he unites himself\nwith him.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:1:3) More literally: \u201cWhen the seer sees the Purusha\u2013self-effulgent,\ncreator, lord, and source of all [relative existence]\u2013then the illumined one completely shakes off both\nvirtue and vice, becomes taintless, and attains absolute equality [non-duality]. That is, the jiva\nrecognizes that Shiva\u2013the Absolute\u2013is its true nature. Then, no longer bound by \u201cdo\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t,\u201d it is\nable to act according to its essential being. Not that morality will be abandoned, but that there will be\nno more need to think it \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d not do something. Rather, it will do the right and the\nperfect spontaneously, naturally, as a consequence of its rediscovered divinity. For it will be free from\nall bonds or compulsions whatever. This is because in the divine vision it has become free from all\ndefects or blemish.\nBut most important is the trait that is listed last: paramam samyam, supreme sameness, literally, but the\n\nmeaning is absolute unity\u2013and therefore absolute identify\u2013with the Absolute Itself.\nSince the two are really one, the upanishad continues describing both the individual and the infinite\nSelves, as they partake of one another\u2019s traits. \u201cThe Lord is the one life shining forth from every\ncreature. Seeing him present in all, the wise man is humble, puts not himself forward. His delight is in\nthe Self, his joy is in the Self, he serves the Lord in all. Such as he, indeed, are the true knowers of\nBrahman.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:1:4)\nHow to do it\nAnyone who ponders these astounding words with intelligence will be eager to attain Brahman, so the\nsage tells how that is done.\n\u201cThis Effulgent Self is to be realized within the lotus of the heart by continence, by steadfastness in\ntruth, by meditation, and by superconscious vision. Their impurities washed away, the seers realize\nhim.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:1:5) This is quite clear, but some precise terms should be considered to\nput a fine point on the message of this verse. Swami Gambhirananda renders it: \u201cThe bright and pure\nSelf within the body, that the monks with attenuated blemishes see, is attainable through truth,\nconcentration, complete knowledge, and continence, practiced constantly.\u201d\nThe Self within the body. The Self is within the body, therefore it is absurd to disdain the body, and even\nmore absurd to engage in a meditation practice that ignores the body and the necessity for its\npurification and spiritual empowerment. Just forgetting about the material side of things and flying off\ninto pure spirit is an appealing idea\u2013the problem is, it is mistaken and can never work. However long or\nshort a journey, it always begins right from the point where we are. And at this point we are not only in\nthe body, we are tied into it by a multitude of bonds, bonds that must be dissolved. Our yoga practice\nmust cover this situation.\nThe prime implication, though, is that since the Self is right here in the body It is not far away. We need\nnot even seek It\u2013just see It.\nThe monks. The word rather poorly translated as \u201cmonk\u201d is yati, which actually means a wanderer. This\nis because in the ancient times in India the wandering ascetics who moved about teaching dharma were\ngiven this title. They were not monks or sannyasis in the later sense. Obviously they were not married,\nas their mode of life prevented that, and their life was dedicated to spiritual discipline and teaching.\nNevertheless, they were not considered outside society as the sadhu is today in India. They were simply\nthose who sacrificed personal life to serve others. It was a noble way of life, but not a separation. The\noriginal Christian ascetics were just the same. They wore ordinary clothes and were considered\nChristian laity. The only distinctive thing about them was their way of life. The men usually lived on\nthe edge of towns, usually as hermits. The women lived together in houses within the town for mutual\nprotection. In the eyes of everyone they were pious bachelors and spinsters, not at all distinct from\nother Christians in an official sense.\nAll right, that is the historical background, but what is the meaning for us today? No matter where we\nmight live, or how, we must all be \u201cwanderers\u201d in the spirit, aware with both Saint Paul and Saint Peter\nthat we are \u201cstrangers and pilgrims on the earth.\u201d (Hebrews 11:13; I Peter 2:11.) Jesus told someone:\n\u201cThe foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his\nhead.\u201d (Matthew 8:20) This is actually the truth about every single sentient being on the earth: there is\nno place where we can come to rest and be at home, for our nature is Spirit and our home is Infinity.\nSo the yatis spoken of here are those who have become rootless in relation to this world. Or more to the\n\npoint, those who have recognized that they have no roots in the world, only in God. (\u201cThe world is\ncrucified unto me, and I unto the world.\u201d Galatians 6:14) And so in their hearts they are always on\npilgrimage back to the Source, aware that wherever they may be it is only a temporary accommodation\non the long journey home\u2013to Brahman.\nAttenuated blemishes. The upanishad has a very informative expression: kshinadoshah\u2013those whose\nmental defects such as anger, etc., have become significantly lessened. Eventually they will be totally\neliminated, but even now such persons are capable of the beginning stages of knowing the Self. This is\nimportant, because we tend to think that until we are absolutely perfect we cannot know either God or\nour Self. This is not so. Just as the sky becomes lightened even before the sun appears above the\nhorizon, so it is with those yogis who earnestly strive for realization. The elementary stages of\nenlightenment dawn for them.\nComplete knowledge. Samyag-jnanena, complete insight into the nature of the Self both intellectually\nand intuitively, also enables us to begin experiencing the realities of the Self. Of course this cannot\noccur outside of yoga practice that is disciplined and steady.\nPracticed constantly. Some translators think this word nityam\u2013perpetual\u2013refers to continence\n(brahmacharya), but others think it refers to constant and uninterrupted observance of all the virtues\nand practices listed in this verse. That is logical, because a break in any of these will set back the\nsadhaka to a significant degree, and in some cases can destroy the possibility of his continuance in\nsadhana by turning his mind away from the Real to the unreal. This is, however, particularly true about\nbrahmacharya as is seen over and over. In Autobiography of a Yogi, Yogananda relates this sad but\ntelling incident:\n\u201cA year later [after entering the ashram], Kumar set out for a visit to his childhood home. He ignored\nthe quiet disapproval of Sri Yukteswar, who never authoritatively controlled his disciples\u2019 movements.\nOn the boy\u2019s return to Serampore in a few months, a change was unpleasantly apparent. Gone was the\nstately Kumar with serenely glowing face. Only an undistinguished peasant stood before us, one who\nhad lately acquired a number of evil habits.\n\u201cMaster summoned me and brokenheartedly discussed the fact that the boy was now unsuited to the\nmonastic hermitage life.\n\u201c\u2018Mukunda, I will leave it to you to instruct Kumar to leave the ashram tomorrow; I can\u2019t do it!\u2019 Tears\nstood in Sri Yukteswar\u2019s eyes, but he controlled himself quickly. \u2018The boy would never have fallen to\nthese depths had he listened to me and not gone away to mix with undesirable companions. He has\nrejected my protection; the callous world must be his guru still.\u2019\u201d This narrative is particularly ironic,\nsince \u201cKumar\u201d means a young male virgin.\nNow all this is extremely to the point, with no fudging under the guise of diplomacy or moderation.\nPerhaps that is why the sage then says to us: \u201cTruth alone succeeds, not untruth. By truthfulness the\npath of felicity is opened up, the path which is taken by the sages, freed from cravings, and which leads\nthem to truth\u2019s eternal abode.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:1:6) Once again Swami Gambhirananda helps\nus understand: \u201cTruth alone wins, and not untruth. By truth is maintained for ever the path called\nDevayana, by which the desireless seers ascend to where exists the supreme treasure attainable through\ntruth.\u201d\nSri Ramakrishna often said that \u201cGod is realized if one holds fast to truth. If there is no strictness in\nobserving truth everything is gradually lost.\u201d As this upanishad says: Satyam eva jayate\u2013truth alone\ntriumphs, both in material and in spiritual life. The path to liberation, Devayana, \u201cthe Path of the\n\nShining Ones,\u201d is opened through truth.\nTruth in this context has a much higher and wider meaning than mere accuracy or honesty in speech. It\nmeans to be a living embodiment of the truth of our Self-nature, and eventually to be a virtual\nincarnation of the realized Truth: God, \u201cthe supreme treasure attainable through truth.\u201d\n\nThe God Within, The Sage Without\nGod\n\u201cBrahman is supreme; he is self-luminous, he is beyond all thought. Subtler than the subtlest is he,\nfarther than the farthest, nearer than the nearest. He resides in the lotus of the heart of every being.\u201d\n(Mundaka Upanishad 3:1:7) This is the great mystery of the Divine. It is subtle beyond subtlety, yet\nexists equally in the most tangible. God is utterly beyond us, and yet nearer to us than can be expressed.\nThis latter fact is a foundation-stone of spiritual life. The more we can turn inward, the deeper we can\npenetrate into our own essential being, the closer we will come to God. Yoga is an absolute necessity.\nThough Prabhavananda uses the expression \u201clotus of the heart,\u201d the Sanskrit text has guhayam\u2013\u201cin the\ncave,\u201d referring to the absolute core of our being.\n\u201cThe eyes do not see him, speech cannot utter him, the senses cannot reach him. He is to be attained\nneither by austerity nor by sacrificial rites. When through discrimination the heart has become pure,\nthen, in meditation, the Impersonal Self is revealed.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:1:8) No action or feeling\nor ideas can reveal God to us. But when the heart has become purified by the spiritual insight that only\nmeditation can produce, then in meditation itself God is revealed. For: \u201cThe subtle Self within the\nliving and breathing body is realized in that pure consciousness wherein is no duality\u2013that\nconsciousness by which the heart beats and the senses perform their office.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad\n3:1:9) Meditation is the beginning, middle, and end of spiritual life. There is a remarkable statement\nmade here\u2013that the same consciousness which even now causes the body, senses, and mind to function\nis the same consciousness in which the Divine Vision takes place. So we need not try to turn ourselves\ninto something other than what we are. We need only use it to free ourselves into Spirit. For that which\nbinds also frees. This is the unique understanding of the ancient sages in India, an understanding\nneeded by the whole world.\nThe sage\nThe West may have no history of such great wisdom, but we have a little platitude that can say much:\n\u201cThe proof of the pudding is in the eating.\u201d As yogis we should keep this principle ever in mind. The\nresults of our yoga practice reveal its character, relevance, and value. The yogi should be thoroughly\npragmatic. \u201cWhat is this doing for me?\u201d should be the constant inquiry regarding his sadhana. That this\nis not inappropriate is shown by the last verse in this section: \u201cWhether of heaven, or of heavenly\nenjoyments, whether of desires, or of objects of desire, whatever thought arises in the heart of the sage\nis fulfilled. Therefore let him who seeks his own good revere and worship the sage.\u201d (Mundaka\nUpanishad 3:1:10)\nThis tells us two things. First, whatever the liberated sage thinks of, wills, or desires, that comes about.\nExamples of this are given in Autobiography of a Yogi, and manifested all through Yogananda\u2019s life,\nespecially toward its end, as seen in Paramahansa Yogananda: In Memoriam The life of Sri\nRamakrishna also demonstrates this. Second, those that seek their highest good\u2013self-realization\u2013should\nreverence and honor the atmajnam, the one who knows the Self. This is very important. The upanishad\nis not counseling us to make a god of a master or to substitute a Brahmajnani for God. When we want\nto learn something we go to an expert. In the same way, those seeking the knowledge of God should\n\nseek out the teachings of great masters of past and present. If very fortunate, the seeker will meet such\na person in the flesh and have personal interchange with him. The mere presence of such a great soul\ncan transform our thinking and awaken our consciousness.\nIf we follow the instructions of an enlightened person regarding our inner development we will come to\nthe exact same state of consciousness revealed in him. Remember, true masters never die. They can\nbless and guide those who approach them in their hearts. Often this is sufficient for the seeker, and can\nbe much safer than following a physically embodied teacher, for often sentimentality and emotional\nprojection completely blind the seeker to the reality/unreality of the teacher. I personally knew gurus\nwhose presence was stunning, even supernatural, but after their physical death they vanished from the\nearth plane, leaving their followers empty. But I also knew teachers who became more intimately\npresent to seekers after their physical form had departed, proving themselves to truly be one with the\nImmortal and Omnipresent. Those who meditate can attune themselves to such masters and benefit\nfrom their very real presence.\nHow can we tell a true master? A true master keeps pointing their students away from themselves to\nGod, the only Goal. And a true disciple is one who goes to God instead of making an idol or fetish of\nthe guru. Anyone silly enough can be a brainwashed groupie, but the wise heed the teacher\u2019s message\nand go on to God. As Buddha said, a worthy teacher or teaching is like a finger pointing at the moon.\nThe idea is to see the moon\u2013not the finger. Nevertheless, the sage can be a very meaningful factor in\nour spiritual life, so the upanishad continues with more information for us.\n\u201cThe sage knows Brahman, the support of all, the pure effulgent being in whom is contained the\nuniverse. They who worship the sage, and do so without thought of self, cross the boundary of birth\nand death.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:2:1) Here are two more principles: A sage is one who knows\nBrahman in the absolute sense, and those who honor them without any personal desire for benefit or\ngain from them will break the ties of earthly rebirth.\nThis second part gives us a picture of real disciples or students who will attain spiritual benefit from a\nteacher: they have no egocentric or personal desire coloring the way they relate to the teacher. Their\nonly interest is in the Self. They are not looking for a teacher to give them \u201cpower\u201d or a reputation for\nhaving the best guru\u2013glory through association is of no interest to them. Nor are they wanting the guru\nto become a substitute for an unsatisfactory parent, friend, spouse, or lover. They do not want a\n\u201cpersonal\u201d relationship with the guru\u2013to either possess the guru or be possessed by the guru. They are\nnot looking for some kind of fulfillment in a \u201crelationship\u201d with the teacher, but only fulfillment in the\nSelf. Swami Bimalananda, a disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda, once told us in a conversation that\nthose who lived in the ashram-headquarters of Self-Realization Fellowship just for the personality of\nYogananda eventually left the spiritual life as well as the ashram, but those who came for God\nremained steadfast in both. I think we can conclude that real disciples are as rare as real gurus! The\nupanishad is not talking to spiritual fool-arounds, but to the worthy, those who wish, in the actual words\nof the upanishad, to \u201ctranscend the seed of human birth\u201d\u2013the ego.\nTwo kinds of seekers\nSince the sage Angiras has put so much emphasis on the value of approaching and reverencing a\nmaster-teacher, he now digresses a bit to point out what makes the student succeed or fail in spiritual\nlife.\n\u201cHe who, brooding upon sense objects, comes to yearn for them, is born here and there, again and\nagain, driven by his desire. But he who has realized the Self, and thus satisfied all hunger, attains to\nliberation even in this life.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:2:2) The Sanskrit implies that those in the grip of\n\ndesire are born where the objects of desire are to be found, and bring the desire for them along. It does\nnot say that the objects are obtained, however, and we see that this is a continual torment for human\nbeings\u2013wanting something but not able to get it. To be in such a situation will only condition the mind\nmore and more toward grasping at the things desired. After who knows how long, the object is then\ngotten and either lost, or in danger of loss, or proves to be disappointing or misery-producing. Such is\nthe dilemma of those who desire.\nThere is no use asking silly questions like: \u201cHow do I kill desire?\u201d or: \u201cHow do I get rid of the ego?\u201d\nYou do not kill desire or discard the ego, for that is a negative approach that by its nature will not work.\nRather you take the positive approach: \u201cI SHALL realize the Self.\u201d For realization of the Self alone can\nquench all desire and dissolve the ego. Until then we ignore the clamor of desires, disregard the\ndemands of the ego, and single-mindedly go after the Self. Along the way the desires will begin\ndropping away of themselves, and the ego, starved of attention, will become less and less until desires\nand ego are simply gone forever. It may not be easy, but it is marvelously simple.\n\u201cThe Self is not to be known through study of the scriptures, nor through subtlety of the intellect, nor\nthrough much learning. But by him who longs for him is he known. Verily unto him does the Self\nreveal his true being.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:2:3)\nAnyone who has travelled this far through the upanishads is very well acquainted with the fact that the\nSelf is not to be known through the usual avenues of human knowledge. What is striking is the literal\nmeaning of the next phrase: \u201cBy the very fact that he [the aspirant] seeks for It, does It become\nattainable.\u201d Elsewhere I have mentioned that Sri Ma Anandamayi often said: \u201cThe desire for God is the\nway to God,\u201d meaning that the desire would prompt us to action, not just mere wishing. No one seeks\nfor God who is not already able to find God, for it is the very nearness of God that prompts his seeking.\nSeeking God is a guarantee, a symptom, of sure attainment. It is also the thing which enables the Self to\nreveal Itself to him.\n\u201cThe Self is not to be known by the weak, nor by the thoughtless, nor by those who do not rightly\nmeditate. But by the rightly meditative, the thoughtful, and the strong, he is fully known.\u201d (Mundaka\nUpanishad 3:2:4) Too many meanings are being missed by this translation. Here it is literally: \u201cThis\nSelf is not attained by one devoid of strength, nor through delusion produced by false experience, nor\nthrough tapasya devoid of corresponding externals. But the Self of the man of knowledge who strives\nwith diligence through these means [strength, clarity of sight and mind, and a life ordered in conformity\nto tapasya] enters the abode of Brahman.\u201d There is a lot to think over here.\nThe plain truths\nThose devoid of the strength imparted by the strict observance of yama and niyama cannot possibly\nknow the Self. Both yama and niyama should be listed here for our most serious consideration. Yama\n(Restraint) consists of ahimsa (non-violence, non-injury, harmlessness), satya (truthfulness, honesty\u2013\ni.e., non-lying), asteya (non-stealing, honesty, non-misappropriativeness), brahmacharya (sexual\ncontinence and control of all the senses), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness, non-greed, nonselfishness, non-acquisitiveness). Niyama (Observance) consists of shaucha (purity, cleanliness),\nsantosha (contentment, peacefulness), tapas (austerity, practical\u2013i.e., result-producing\u2013spiritual\ndiscipline), swadhyaya (self-study, spiritual study), and Ishwarapranidhana (offering of one\u2019s life to\nGod).\nA great deal of people, including yogis, are simply deluded, mostly because they follow false teachings\nand teachers whose errors actively harm them or cause them to stagnate spiritually. No matter how\ndedicated they may be, or even how disciplined, they cannot know the Self because their intellects are\n\nconfused and distorted\u2013especially by their aberrant meditation practices. Lucky are those \u201cyoga duds\u201d\nwho merely vegetate. But neither reach the Goal.\nIt is utterly useless to engage in meditation without making the life correspond to the sole purpose of\nmeditation: liberation of the spirit. Yoga has been propagated here in the West for a little over a\nhundred years, and see how little good and how much devastation and delusion has resulted. The\nreason is supremely simple: yama and niyama are not followed, and in many instances the fake gurus\nactually tell their dupes that yama and niyama are unnecessary. I cannot calculate how many tangledminded \u201cyogis\u201d have boasted to me that they do not need to be vegetarians. If a survey is taken of\nalmost any yoga group, over half will be living together \u201cin a relationship\u201d without being married, and\nthose who are married have no idea of the need for brahmacharya in marriage except for the conception\nof children\u2013and even then, not unrestrained. Sri Ramakrishna said that after the birth of two children\nthe parents should live in chastity. In my commentary on the Gita I wrote the following that is most\nrelevant here:\n\u201cThe Dharma Shastras which describe the correct life of non-monastics are quite explicit about the\nneed for husband and wife to lead lives of continence. See how the yogi parents of Paramhansa\nYogananda lived it as presented in Autobiography of a Yogi. In the very first chapter we find: \u2018Mother\nmade a remarkable admission to my eldest sister Roma: \u201cYour father and myself live together as man\nand wife only once a year, for the purpose of having children.\u201d\u2019 The fact that Yogananda, a devoted son\nand a pure-hearted yogi, would reveal this to the world in the pages of a book show how necessary he\nfelt it was for both Eastern and Western readers to be shown the standard of chastity that yogis should\nobserve in their life, not using their non-monastic status as excuse for lesser behavior. He underlined\nthis later in the forty-fourth chapter, giving these words written to Mahatma Gandhi by his wife\nKasturbai: \u2018I thank you for the most perfect marriage in the world, based on brahmacharya and not on\nsex.\u2019 Please note that these are examples of married yogis, not monks imposing their ideas on others.\nAlso remember that the guru of Yogananda\u2019s parents was himself a married yogi, so there is no\nmonastic influence in their case.\u201d\nI really have no hope that the foregoing will provoke anything but anger and resentment, but it still has\nto be said in case some do want to reach the Goal whatever the price. The other aspects of yama and\nniyama are also important, but these two shoals have wrecked many a yogi of East and West.\n\u201cBut the Self of the man of knowledge who strives with diligence through these means\u201d\u2013strength,\nclarity of sight and mind, and a life ordered in conformity to tapasya\u2013\u201centers the abode of Brahman.\u201d\n\nHail To the Sages!\n\u201cHaving known the Self, the sages are filled with joy. Blessed are they, tranquil of mind, free from\npassion. Realizing everywhere the all-pervading Brahman, deeply absorbed in contemplation of his\nbeing, they enter into him, the Self of all.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:2:5) What an inspiring description.\nThese are the things that should motivate us, not such cheap things as promises of heaven and threats of\nhell, or bribes of \u201cgood things\u201d and \u201cpower.\u201d To at last be ourselves as we really are, to end all struggle\nwith unreality and ignorance\u2013this is the worthy aim. The only worthy prayer is that of Jesus: \u201cO Father,\nglorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.\u201d (John\n17:5)\nHow to become a sage\nHow do the sages get that way? \u201cHaving fully ascertained and realized the truth of Vedanta, having\nestablished themselves in purity of conduct by following the yoga of renunciation, these great ones\n\nattain to immortality in this very life; and when their bodies fall away from them at death, they attain to\nliberation.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:2:6)\nHaving fully ascertained and realized the truth of Vedanta. First the Vedantic truths\u2013the teachings\nfound in the upanishads\u2013are carefully read and pondered. But this is not enough\u2013in fact it is worthless\nunless they go on to realize those truths through meditation, for it is this realization which is of\nsupreme value, and the wise diligently seek it.\nHaving established themselves in purity of conduct. Not wanting empty theory, the wise understand that\ntheir lives must be disciplined for the purification of their outer actions and inner consciousness.\nMoreover, they ground themselves immovably in that purity.\nFollowing the yoga of renunciation. Since neither Angiras or his students were monks, it is mistaken to\ninterpret sannyasa yoga as monastic life. Rather, it is the inner discipline of detachment from all\nexternals (sannyasa) while fixing the mind on the Eternal (yoga).\nImmortality in this very life. Those who follow this path of the sages will realize their nature as\nimmortality itself. They will not attain it, they will recover and manifest it. Nor will this happen in\nsome vague heavenly realm, but right here and now.\nAt death, they attain to liberation. For them there is no longer any need for future birth in the material\nplane. As the Buddhist texts say: \u201cBirth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing\nfurther for this world.\u201d But they are not just liberated from the earth, they are liberated from all\n\u201cworlds\u201d and enter The Real as their eternal abode.\nThe liberation process\n\u201cWhen death overtakes the body, the vital energy enters the cosmic source, the senses dissolve in their\ncause, and karmas and the individual soul are lost in Brahman, the pure, the changeless. As rivers flow\ninto the sea and in so doing lose name and form, even so the wise man, freed from name and form,\nattains the Supreme Being, the Self-Luminous, the Infinite.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:2:7, 8) There are\ntwo aspects to these verses: what is shed by the sage and What he merges with in liberation.\nAt the time of death, the various bodies no longer retain their configuration. Since they are no longer\nneeded for future incarnations, they resolve back into the elements from which they came. Even the\nkarmic forces, now unnecessary, melt away into basic energy along with the subtle bodies that created\nand embodied them. What remains? Brahman and their atman-self. Since these are really the source of\nall the foregoing, in reality nothing whatever is lost\u2013only the conditioning dreams that held them in\nfalse bondage for so long. Finitude is traded for infinity\u2013blessed bargain!\n\u201cHe who knows Brahman becomes Brahman. No one ignorant of Brahman is ever born in his family.\nHe passes beyond all sorrow. He overcomes evil. Freed from the fetters of ignorance he becomes\nimmortal.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:2:9)\nWho should learn this?\n\u201cLet the truth of Brahman be taught only to those who obey his law, who are devoted to him, and who\nare pure in heart. To the impure let it never be taught.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:2:10)\nIn India everyone knows the basic principles of Brahmavidya. The sage is not recommending secrecy,\nbut warning us away from wasting our time with people who are wilfully disqualifying themselves for\nspiritual life. So who are qualified (adhikari) to receive detailed instruction in the eternal truths? Here is\n\na much more literal and complete translation of the verse with some very interesting symbols: \u201cTo them\nalone should one expound this knowledge of Brahman who are engaged in the practice of purificatory\ndisciplines, versed in the Vedas, and devoted to Brahman, who personally sacrifice to the fire called\nEkarshi with faith, and by whom has been duly accomplished the vow of holding fire on the head.\u201d\nEngaged in the practice of purificatory disciplines. The word translated by this phrase is kriyavantah,\nwhich means those who are engaged in the practice of kriyas. In the broad sense a kriya is any practice\nthat entails doing something, because the root of kriya is kri, which means \u201cI do.\u201d Any practice,\nexercise, rite, or even movement can be called a kriya. Usually, though, kriya means a yogic practice or\nmethod which purifies the body and nervous system, as well as the subtle bodies, to enable the yogi to\nreach and hold on to higher levels of consciousness and being. Only those who are perpetually engaged\nin such practices need even hear about those states and their meaning. For to anyone else it is mere\ntheory which can easily be misunderstood by those who have no practical yogic experience.\nVersed in the scriptures. The word shrotriyah means one who both knows the scriptures and the\ndisciplines and practices they enjoin. Although mere scriptural knowledge is of little value, it is\nnecessary to know the teachings of the upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita in order to retain a right\nperspective in spiritual life. Buddha said that a seeker for enlightenment must be sure to follow the\nteachings of the liberated ones that have gone before. A great deal of problems in spiritual life will be\navoided if the upanishads and Gita are studied daily and applied in their entirety.\nDevoted to Brahman. Shankara says that the Brahmanishthah are those devoted to Brahman as\nmanifested in the cosmos, yet who are actively seeking to know the transcendent Brahman beyond the\ncosmos. In other words, the prevailing idea that one is either intent on Saguna or Nirguna Brahman\u2013\nonly one aspect to the exclusion of the other\u2013is mistaken. That the worthy seeker starts from where he\nfinds himself\u2013in the realm of Ishwara, the creation\u2013but strives to know That which lies beyond, as well.\nThis is the real \u201cyoga of synthesis.\u201d\nWho personally sacrifice to the fire called Ekarshi with faith. In the Atharva Veda there is a form of\nsacred fire called \u201cekarshi,\u201d but in this verse the reference is to \u201cthe sole fire\u201d\u2013the \u201cfire\u201d that is\nBrahman. For ekarshi can be a contraction of \u201ceka-rishi,\u201d the sole Seer. As the Gita says: \u201cBrahman is\nthe ritual, Brahman is the offering, Brahman is he who offers to the fire that is Brahman. If a man sees\nBrahman in every action, He will find Brahman.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 4:24) The ultimate \u201coffering\u201d into\nBrahman is our own Self.\nBy whom has been duly accomplished the vow of holding fire on the head. Continuing this idea, the\nrishi speaks of those who have accomplished in due order the shirovratam\u2013a vow of holding or\ncarrying the holy fire in the head. That is, one who has established the Divine Fire of Brahmanrealization within himself, who ever carries Brahman in his \u201chead\u201d\u2013his consciousness.\nThere will not be a great number of students if these criteria are followed, but we must make sure that\nwe are among them.\nThe sum and substance\nIn conclusion the upanishad exclaims: \u201cHail to the sages! Hail to the illumined souls! This truth of\nBrahman was taught in ancient times to Shounaka by Angira. Hail to the sages! Hail to the illumined\nsouls!\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 3:2:11)\nEnd of Mundaka Commentary",
    "Mandukya": "\n\nMandukya Upanishad\nTranslated by Vidyavachaspati V. Panoli\nOm ! O gods, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious;\nMay we, while offering our praise to gods\nWith our bodies strong of limbs,\nEnjoy the life which the gods are pleased to grant us.\nMay Indra of great fame be well disposed to us;\nMay the all-knowing (or immensely wealthy) Pusha be propitious to us;\nMay Garuda, the vanquisher of miseries, be well pleased with us;\nMay Brihaspati grant us all prosperity.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\n1. All this is the letter Om. A vivid explanation of this (is begun). All that is past, present, and future is\nbut Om. Whatever transcends the three periods of time, too, is Om.\n2. All this is certainly Brahman. This Self is Brahman. This Self, as such, is possessed of four quarters.\n3. (The Self) seated in the waking state and called Vaisvanara who, possessed of the consciousness of\nthe exterior, and seven limbs and nineteen mouths, enjoys the gross objects, is the first quarter.\n4. (The Self) seated in the state of dream and called Taijasa who, possessed of the consciousness of the\ninterior, and seven limbs and nineteen mouths, enjoys the subtle objects, is the second quarter.\n5. Where the sleeper desires not a thing of enjoyment and sees not any dream, that state is deep sleep.\n(The Self) seated in the state of deep sleep and called Prajna, in whom everything is unified, who is\ndense with consciousness, who is full of bliss, who is certainly the enjoyer of bliss, and who is the door\nto the knowledge (of the preceding two states), is the third quarter.\n6. This is the Lord of all; this is omniscient; this is the in-dwelling controller (of all); this is the source\nand indeed the origin and dissolution of all beings.\n7. The Fourth is thought of as that which is not conscious of the internal world, nor conscious of the\nexternal world, nor conscious of both the worlds, nor dense with consciousness, nor simple\nconsciousness, nor unconsciousness, which is unseen, actionless, incomprehensible, uninferable,\nunthinkable, indescribable, whose proof consists in the identity of the Self (in all states), in which all\nphenomena come to a cessation, and which is unchanging, auspicious, and non-dual. That is the Self;\n\nthat is to be known.\n8. That same Self, from the point of view of the syllable, is Om, and viewed from the stand point of the\nletters, the quarters are the letters, and the letters are the quarters. The letters are a, u and m.\n9. Vaisvanara seated in the waking state is the first letter a, owing to its all-pervasiveness or being the\nfirst. He who knows thus verily accomplishes all longings and becomes the first.\n10. Taijasa seated in the dream is u, the second letter (of Om), owing to the similarity of excellence or\nintermediate position. He who knows thus verily advances the bounds of his knowledge and becomes\nequal (to all) and none who is not a knower of Brahman is born in his family.\n11. Prajna seated in the state of deep sleep is m, the third letter (of Om), because of his being the\nmeasure or the entity wherein all become absorbed. He who knows thus measures all this and absorbs\nall.\n12. That which is without letters (parts) is the Fourth, beyond apprehension through ordinary means,\nthe cessation of the phenomenal world, the auspicious and the non-dual. Thus Om is certainly the Self.\nHe who knows thus enters the Self by the Self.\nOm ! O gods, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious;\nMay we, while offering our praise to gods\nWith our bodies strong of limbs,\nEnjoy the life which the gods are pleased to grant us.\nMay Indra of great fame be well disposed to us;\nMay the all-knowing (or immensely wealthy) Pusha be propitious to us;\nMay Garuda, the vanquisher of miseries, be well pleased with us;\nMay Brihaspati grant us all prosperity.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Mandukyopanishad, as contained in the Atharva-Veda.\nMANDUKYA KARIKA OF GAUDAPADA\nI. AGAMA PRAKARANA\nInvocation\n1. I bow to that Brahman who pervades the entire world by a diffusion of the rays of knowledge that\npervade all things that are moving and unmoving, who after having enjoyed (in the waking state) all\nobjects of enjoyment that are gross, and who again, after having drunk (in the state of dream) all\nobjects born of desire and illumined by the intellect, reposes while experiencing bliss Himself and\nmaking us all enjoy by (His own) Maya, and who, through an attribution of Maya, is the fourth in\nnumber, and is supreme, immortal and unborn.\n2. May he, the Self of the universe, dwelling in the fourth state, protect us, who, after having enjoyed\n(in the waking state) the gross enjoyments resulting from virtue and vice, enjoys again (in the dream\nstate) the other subtle objects which are created by His own intelligence and illumined by His own\nlight, and who, after having absorbed all of them gradually into Himself and having abandoned all\ndistinctions, becomes devoid of attributes.\nI-1. Visva having exterior consciousness is all-pervading, whereas Taijasa has interior consciousness,\nand Prajna, similarly is dense with consciousness. Thus the One alone is regarded in there ways.\nI-2. Visva is seen in the right eye which is its seat of experience, whereas Taijasa is inside the mind and\nPrajna is in the space inside the heart. In these three ways he dwells in the body.\nI-3. Visva is ever the enjoyer of the gross, taijasa of the subtle, and, similarly, Prajna of bliss. Know\n(therefore) the enjoyment in three ways.\n\nI-4.The grass satisfies Visva, the subtle satisfies Taijasa and, similarly, gladness satisfies Prajna. Know\n(therefore) the satisfaction in three ways.\nI-5. He who knows these two, viz that which is shown to be the thing to be enjoyed and that which is\n(shown) to be the enjoyer, in the three states, does not become affected, even though enjoying.\nI-6. It is a settled fact that coming into being can be said only of positive entities that exist. Prana\ncreates all; and Purusha creates the conscious beings separately.\nI-7. Those who think of creation hold it as the manifestation of God's power; while others regard\ncreation as same as dream and illusion.\nI-8. Creation is the mere will of the Lord, say those who thought out well the (process of) creation, but\nthose who rely upon time hold that the birth of beings is from time.\nI-9. Some others hold that creation is for the enjoyment (of God), yet others say that it is for His sport.\nBut it is the very nature of the resplendent Being, (for) what desire can he have whose desire is all\nfulfilled?\nI-10. Turiya, the Lord powerful to bring about the cessation of all sorrows, is imperishable, is regarded\nas the non-dual Lord of all entities, and is all-pervading.\nI-11. Visva and Taijasa are regarded as conditioned by cause and effect. Prajna is conditioned by cause.\nBut these two (viz cause and effect) do not exist in Turiya.\nI-12. Prajna knows neither himself nor others, neither truth nor untruth. But that Turiya is ever the all\nseer.\nI-13. The non-cognition of duality is common to both Prajna and Turiya. Prajna is possessed of sleep of\nthe nature of cause, whereas that sleep does not exist in Turiya.\nI-14. The first two (viz Visva and taijasa) are associated with dream and sleep, but Prajna (is\nassociated) with sleep devoid of dream. The knowers of Brahman do not see either sleep or dream in\nTuriya.\nI-15. Dream belongs to him who perceives wrongly and sleep to him who knows not Reality. When the\nfalse notion of these two comes to an end, the state of Turiya is attained.\nI-16. When the individual Self, sleeping under the influence of Maya that is beginningless, is\nawakened, then he realises (Turiya that is) unborn, sleepless, dreamless and non-dual.\nI-17. If a phenomenal world were to exist, it should, no doubt, cease to be. This duality is but an\nillusion; in reality it is non-dual.\nI-18. The notion (such as the teacher, the taught and the scripture) will disappear, if anyone had\nimagined it. This notion (of the teacher etc.,) is for the purpose of instruction. When (the Truth is)\nrealised, duality does not exist.\nI-19. When the identity of Visva with the letter a is meant, ie., when the identity of Visva with the letter\na is admitted, the common feature of being the first is seen to be obvious, as also the common feature\nof all-pervasiveness.\nI-20. In the event of Taijasa being apprehended as identical with u, ie, when the identity of taijasa with\nthe letter u is admitted, the common feature of superiority is seen clearly and so, too, is the intermediate\nposition.\nI-21. In the even of Prajna being apprehended as identical with m, ie, when the identity of Prajna with\nthe letter m is admitted, the common feature of being the measure is seen to be obvious and so too is\nthe common feature of absorption.\nI-22. He who knows conclusively the common similarities in the three states, becomes worthy of\nworship and adoration by all beings, and is also a great sage.\nI-23. The letter a leads to Visva and the letter u to Taijasa. Again, the letter m (leads) to Prajna. For the\none who is free from letters, there is no attainment.\nI-24. Om should be known, quarter by quarter. It is beyond doubt that the quarters (of the self) are the\nletters (of Om). Having known Om, quarter by quarter, one should not think of anything else.\nI-25. Let the mind be fixed on Om, for Om is Brahman, the fearless. For him who us ever fixed on Om,\n\nthere is no fear anywhere.\nI-26. Om is indeed the lower Brahman; Om is (also) regarded as the higher (Brahman). Om is without a\ncause, without interior and exterior, without effect, and is undecaying.\nI-27. Om is indeed the beginning, middle and end of everything. Having known Om thus, one attains\nimmediately the identity with the self.\nI-28. One should know Om to be the Lord dwelling in the hearts of all. having known the all-pervasive\nOm, the intelligent one does not grieve.\nI-29. He by whom is known Om which is without measure and possessed of infinite magnitude and\nwhich is auspicious, since all duality ceases in it, is a sage and none else.\nII. VAITATHYA PRAKARANA\nII-1. The wise declare the unreality of all objects in a dream because they are located within (the body)\nand (also) because they are confined within a limited space.\nII-2. Since the period is short, one does not go to the place and see. Also, every dreamer, when\nawakened, does not exist in that place (of dream).\nII-3. The non-existence of the chariot etc., (seen in dream) is heard of (in the sruti) from the point of\nview of reasoning. The knowers of Brahman say that the unreality thus arrived at (through reasoning) is\nrevealed (by the sruti) in the context of dream.\nII-4. There is the unreality of the objects even in the waking state. Just as they are unreal in dream, so\nalso are they unreal in the waking state. the objects (in dream) differ owing to the location within the\nbody owing to the spatial limitation.\nII-5. The wise say that the states of waking and dream are same, in view of the similarity of the objects\n(seen in both the states) and in view of the well-known ground of inference.\nII-6. That which is non-existent in the beginning and at the end is definitely so in the present (ie., in the\nmiddle). The objects, though they bear the mark of the unreal, appear as though real.\nII-7. Their utility is opposed in dream. therefore, on the ground of having a beginning and an end, they\nare regarded as definitely unreal.\nII-8. (To see) unusual things (in dream) is indeed an attribute of the dreamer just as it is in the case of\nthose who dwell in heaven. These he perceives by going there, even as one, well instructed, does in this\nworld.\nII-9. Even in dream what is imagined by the mind (chitta) within is unreal, while what is grasped\noutside by the mind is real. But both these are seen to be unreal.\nII-10. Even in the waking state what is imagined by the mind within is unreal, while what is grasped by\nthe mind outside is real. It is reasonable to hold both these to be unreal.\nII-11. If the objects of both the states be unreal, who comprehends all these and who again imagines\nthem?\nII-12. The self-luminous Self, by Its own Maya imagines Itself by Itself and It alone cognises all\nobjects. This is a settled fact of the Vedanta-texts.\nII-13. The Lord imagined in diverse forms the worldly objects existing in the mind. With the mind\nturned outward, He imagines diversely permanent objects (as also impermanent things). Thus the Lord\nimagines.\nII-14. Things that exist within as long as the thought lasts and things that are external and conform to\ntwo points of time, are all imaginations alone. The distinction (between them) is caused by nothing\nelse.\nII-15. The objects that seem to be unmanifested within the mind, and those that seem to be manifested\nwithout, are all mere imaginations, their distinction being the difference in the sense-organs.\nII-16. First of all, He imagines the Jiva (individual soul) and then (He imagines) various objects,\nexternal and internal. As is (a man\u2019s) knowledge, so is (his) memory of it.\nII-17. Just as a rope, the nature of which is not known in the dark, is imagined to be things such as a\n\nsnake, a water-line, etc., so too is the Self imagined (as various things).\nII-18. As when the (real nature of the) rope is known, the illusion ceases and the rope alone remains in\nits non-dual nature, so too is the ascertainment of the Self.\nII-19. (The Self) is imagined as infinite objects like prana etc. This is the Maya of the luminous One by\nwhich It itself is deluded, (as it where).\nII-20. The knowers of Prana hold Prana (to be the cause of the world), which the knowers of the\nelements regard the elements (to be the cause). Qualities (are the cause), say the knowers of quality,\nwhereas the knowers of category consider categories (to be so).\nII-21. The knowers of the quarters (such as Visva) hold the quarters (to be the cause), while the\nknowers of sensory objects regard sensory objects (to be the cause). the worlds (are real), say the\nknowers of the worlds, and the knowers of the gods consider the gods (to be so).\nII-22. Those well-versed in the Vedic lore hold the Vedas (to be real), while the sacrificers subscribe it\nto the sacrifices. Those who know the enjoyer hold the enjoyer (to be real), whereas those familiar with\nthe enjoyable things think of them (to be real).\nII-23. Subtlety (is real), say those who know the subtlety, while those familiar with the gross regard it\nto be so. (Reality is) possessed of a form, say the worshippers of God with form, while the worshippers\nof the formless (hold the reality) to be formless.\nII-24. The astrologers hold time (to be real), while the knowers of directions consider directions (to be\nso). Those stiff in debate affirm that disputations (lead to the reality), whereas those who aspire after\nthe worlds consider them (to be real).\nII-25. The knowers of the mind hold it (to be the Self), while the knowers of the intellect regard it (to\nbe so). The knowers of the heart ascribe (reality to it), whereas it is attributed to virtue and vice by\nthose who know them.\nII-26. Some say that twenty-five categories (constitute the reality), whereas others speak of twenty-six.\nAgain, some say that thirty-one categories (constitute it), yet some others hold that they are infinite.\nII-27. Those who know the people (and their pleasures) find reality in pleasures. Those who are\nfamiliar with the stages of life regard them (as real). The grammarians (ascribe reality) to the words in\nthe masculine, feminine and neuter genders, whereas others (know reality) to be the higher and lower\n(brahman).\nII-28. Those who know all about creation (say that reality consists in) creation. (Reality lies) in\ndissolution, say those who know it, while those who know about subsistence (hold it to be the reality).\nAll these ideas are always imagined on the Self.\nII-29. He to whom (a teacher) might show an object sees that alone (as the reality). That object, too,\nbecoming one with him, protects him. That state of being engrossed culminates in his self-identity with\nthe object shown.\nII-30. By these things that are non-separate (from the Self), this Self is manifested as though separate.\nHe who knows this truly comprehends (the meaning of the Vedas) without entertaining any doubt.\nII-31. Just as dream and magic, as well as a city in the sky, are seen (to be unreal), so too, is this\nuniverse seen (to be unreal) from the Vedanta-texts by the wise.\nII-32. There is no dissolution, no origination, none in bondage, none possessed of the means of\nliberation, none desirous of liberation, and none liberated. This is the ultimate truth.\nII-33. This (Self) is imagined to be unreal objects and also to be non-dual. The objects are also\nimagined on the non-dual (Self). therefore non-duality is auspicious.\nII-34. This (world) viewed on the basis of the Self, is not different. Neither does it ever exist\nindependent by itself nor is anything different or non-different (from the Self). Thus know the knowers\nof Truth.\nII-35. By the sages who are free from attachment, fear and anger and well-versed in the Vedas is\nrealised this Self which is beyond all imaginations, in which the phenomenal world ceases to exist and\nwhich is non-dual.\n\nII-36. Therefore, having known it thus, one should fix one\u2019s memory on non-duality (ie., should give\nundivided attention). Having attained the non-dual, one should conduct oneself as though one were a\ndullard.\nII-37. The ascetic should be free from praise and salutation and also from rituals. The body and the Self\nshould be his support and he should depend upon what chance brings.\nII-38. Having perceived Truth internally and having perceived it externally, one should become\nidentified with Truth, should derive delight from Truth, and should never deviate from Truth.\nIII. ADVAITA PRAKARANA\nIII-1. The aspirant, resorting himself to devotion, remains in the conditioned Brahman. Prior to creation\nall this was of the nature of the birthless Brahman. Hence the man (with such a view) is considered to\nbe of narrow outlook.\nIII-2. Therefore, I shall describe that (Brahman) which is free from limitation, is unborn and is ever the\nsame. Listen how nothing whatsoever is born, though it appears to be born in all respects.\nIII-3. The self is said to be existing in the form of Jivas (individual souls), just as (the infinite) ether\nexists in the form of ether confined within jars. Similarly, It is said to be existing as the aggregate of\nbodies, even as ether exists like jars etc. This is the illustration with regard to birth.\nIII-4. Just as when the jars etc., cease to exist, the ether etc., confined within them become merged in\nthe infinite ether, so also the individual souls become merged in the Self here.\nIII-5. Just as when the ether confined within a particular jar contains dust and smoke, that is not the\ncase with all jars, in the same way, all the individual souls are not associated with happiness etc.\nIII-6. Though forms, functions and names differ here and there (in respect of the ether contained by jars\netc.,), yet this causes no differences in the ether. Similar is the conclusion with regard to individual\nsouls.\nIII-7. As the ether within a jar is not a modification nor a part of the (infinite) ether, so an individual\nsoul is never a modification nor a part of the (supreme) Self.\nIII-8. Just as to the children the sky becomes soiled by dirt, so too, to the unwise the Self becomes\ntainted by impurities.\nIII-9. The Self, in regard to Its death and birth, going and coming, and Its existence in all the bodies, is\nnot dissimilar to ether.\nIII-10. All aggregates (such as body) are created like dream by the Maya of the Self. Whether they be\nsuperior (to another) or equal, there is no ground to prove their reality.\nIII-11. The individual Self of the sheaths beginning with that made of food, which have been described\nin the Taittiriya Upanishad, is (the same as) the supreme Self, as explained (by us already) on the\nanalogy of ether.\nIII-12. Just as it is taught that ether in the earth and the belly is verily the same, so also the supreme\nBrahman is declared to be the same with reference to every two (viz., the corporeal and superphysical),\nin the Madhu-Brahmana (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad).\nIII-13. Since the non-difference of Jiva (individual soul) and the supreme Self is extolled on the basis\nof their identity, and since diversity is censured, therefore, that (non-duality) alone is reasonable.\nIII-14. The separateness of the individual soul and the supreme Self which has been declared (in the\nsruti) prior to the discussion of creation (in the Upanishads), is in a secondary sense in view of the\nresult of the future, for it (separateness) is not in fitness if held in its primary sense.\nIII-15. The creation which is differently set forth by means of (the illustrations of) earth, gold, sparks\netc., is (just) a means to reveal the idea (of identity). But multiplicity does not exist in any manner.\nIII-16. There are three stages of life \u2013 low, medium, and high. This meditation is enjoined for their sake\nout of compassion.\nIII-17. The dualists, firmly settled in their own doctrine which is arrived at by their own conclusions,\ncontradict one another. But this (view of the non-dualist) is in no conflict with them.\n\nIII-18. Non-duality is indeed the supreme Reality, inasmuch as duality is said to be its product. For\nthem duality constitutes both (the Real and the unreal). Hence this (our view) is not opposed (to theirs).\nIII-19. This unborn (Self) undergoes modification through Maya and not in any other way. For, if the\nmodifications are to be a reality, the immortal would tend to be mortal.\nIII-20. The disputants think of the very unborn Self on terms of birth. How can the Self that is unborn\nand immortal tend towards mortality?\nIII-21. The immortal can never become mortal. So, too mortal can never become immortal. For a\nchange in one\u2019s nature cannot ever take place in any manner.\nIII-22. How can the entity that is immortal remain unchanged according to one to whom a thing that is\nimmortal by nature can be born, since it is a product (in his view) ?\nIII-23. The sruti favours equally the creation in reality and through Maya. That which is settled by the\nsruti and supported by reasoning is true, and not anything else.\nIII-24. Since the sruti says, \"There is no multiplicity here\", \"the Lord, owing to Maya, (is seen\ndiversely)\", and \"The Self, though unborn, (appears to be born in many ways)\", it becomes obvious that\nHe is born through Maya.\nIII-25. By the censure of (the worship of) Hiranyagarbha is negated creation. By the statement, \"Who\nwill cause it to be born?\", is denied causality.\nIII-26. On the ground of non-apprehension (of Brahman), all the preceding instruction (for Its\ncomprehension) is negated by the sruti, \"This Self is that which has been declared as \u2018Not this, not\nthis\u2019\". Hence the unborn Self becomes revealed by Itself.\nIII-27. Birth of that which exists occurs only through Maya and not in reality. He who thinks that\nsomething is born in reality, (should know) that that which is already born is (re)born.\nIII-28. The birth of that which is non-existent cannot occur either through Maya or in reality, for a son\nof a barren woman cannot be born either through Maya or in reality.\nIII-29. As in dream the mind vibrates through Maya, as though with dual roles, so in the waking state\nthe mind vibrates through Maya, as though with dual roles.\nIII-30. There can be no doubt that the non-dual mind alone appears in dream in dual roles. Similarly, in\nthe waking state too, the non-dual mind appears to possess dual roles.\nIII-31. Whatever there is, moving and unmoving, which constitutes this duality, is perceived by the\nmind, for when mind does not exist as mind, duality is never perceived.\nIII-32. When the mind ceases to imagine consequent on the realisation of the Truth which is the Self,\nthen it attains the state of not being the mind and becomes a non-perceiver, owing to the absence of\nobjects to be perceived.\nIII-33. (The knowers of Brahman) say that the knowledge which is free from imagination, and unborn\nis not distinct from the knowable. The knowledge of which Brahman is the sole object is unborn and\neverlasting. The unborn (Self) is known by the (knowledge that is) unborn.\nIII-34. The behaviour of the mind (thus) restrained, which is free from all imagination and which is\nendowed with discrimination, should be noticed. The mind in deep sleep is of a different character and\nis not like that (when it is under restraint).\nIII-35. The mind becomes dissolved in deep sleep, but when under restraint, it doesn\u2019t become\ndissolved. That (mind) alone becomes Brahman, the fearless, endowed with the light that is\nConsciousness on all sides.\nIII-36. (Brahman is) birthless, sleepless, dreamless, nameless, formless, ever-resplendent and\nomniscient. (As regards That) there can be no routine practice of any kind.\nIII-37. The Self is devoid of all (external) organs, and is above all internal organs. It is exquisitely\nserene, eternally resplendent, divinely absorbed, unchanging and fearless.\nIII-38. Where there is no thought whatever, there is no acceptance or rejection. Then knowledge, rooted\nin the Self, attains the state of birthlessness and sameness.\nIII-39. This Yoga that is said to be not in touch with anything is hard to be perceived by anyone of the\n\nYogis, for the Yogis who behold fear in what is fearless, are afraid of it.\nIII-40. For all the Yogis, fearlessness, cessation of misery, awareness and everlasting peace, depend\nupon the control of their mind.\nIII-41. By a tireless effort such as that by which the emptying of an ocean, drop by drop, is aimed at\nwith the help of the edge of a Kusa grass, the conquest of the mind will become possible through\nabsence of dejection.\nIII-42. With the (proper) means one should bring under restraint the mind that is torn amid desire and\nenjoyment. Even when the mind is well settled down in sleep, it should be brought under restraint, for\nsleep is as harmful as desire.\nIII-43. Remembering that everything is productive of grief, one should withdraw (one\u2019s mind) from the\nenjoyment of the objects of desire. (Similarly), remembering that everything is the unborn Brahman,\none does not certainly see the born (ie., duality).\nIII-44. The mind that is in deep sleep should be awakened and the mind that is distracted should be\nbrought back to tranquillity again. One should know the mind as passion-tinged, and should not disturb\nit when it has attained the state of equillibrium.\nIII-45. In that state one should not enjoy the happiness, but should, by means of discrimination, become\nunattached. When the mind that has become still tends towards wandering, it should be unified (with\nthe self) with efforts.\nIII-46. When the mind does not become merged nor distracted again, when it becomes motionless and\ndoes not make appearances (as objects), then it verily becomes Brahman.\nIII-47. That highest Bliss exists in one\u2019s own Self. It is calm, identical with liberation, indescribable,\nand unborn. Since It is one with the unborn knowable (Brahman), the knowers of Brahman speak of It\nas the Omniscient (Brahman).\nIII-48. No Jiva (individual soul), whichsoever, is born. It has no cause (of birth). (Such being the case),\nthis is the highest Truth where nothing is born whatsoever.\nIV. ALATASANTI PRAKARANA\n(On extinguishing the fire brand)\nIV-1. I bow down to him who is the best among men and who has realised the individual souls that are\nlike ether, through his knowledge which again resembles ether and is not different from the object of\nknowledge.\nIV-2. I bow down to that Yoga which is devoid of touch with anything (that implies relationship),\nwhich conduces to the happiness of all beings and is beneficial, and which is free from dispute and\ncontradiction and is taught by the scriptures.\nIV-3. Certain disputants postulate the birth of an entity already existing, while some others, proud of\ntheir intelligence, and opposing among themselves, postulate the birth of what is not existing already.\nIV-4. That which already exists cannot be born and that which does not exist also cannot be born.\nThose who argue thus are none but non-dualists and proclaim only the birthlessness.\nIV-5. We approve the birthlessness revealed by them. We do not quarrel with them. Now, learn this\nwhich is free from all disputes.\nIV-6. The disputants think of the self on terms of birth. How can the Self that is unborn and immortal\ntend towards mortality.\nIV-7. The immortal can never become mortal. So, too the mortal can never become immortal. For a\nchange in one\u2019s nature cannot ever take place in any manner.\nIV-8. How can the entity that is immortal remain unchanged according to one in whose view a thing\nthat is immortal by nature can be born, since it is an effect (in his view) ?\nIV-9. By the term nature is to be known that which comes into being through right attainments, which\nis intrinsic, inborn, and non-produced, and which does not give up its character.\nIV-10. All the souls are free from decay and death by nature. But by thinking of decay and death, and\n\nbecoming absorbed in that thought, they deviate (from that nature).\nIV-11. According to him who holds that the cause itself is the effect, the cause must be born. How can\nthat which is born be unborn? How can that which is subject to modification be eternal ?\nIV-12. If (in your view) the effect is non-different from the cause and if, for that reason, the effect also\nis unborn, how can the cause be eternal, since it is non-different from the effect that undergoes birth ?\nIV-13. He who holds the view that the effect is born from an unborn cause, has no example (to be\ncited). If the born effect is viewed as born from another born thing, it leads to ad infinitum.\nIV-14. How can they, who hold that the effect is the source of the cause and the cause is the source of\nthe effect, assert beginninglessness for cause and effect ?\nIV-15. According to the disputants who hold that the effect is the origin of the cause and the cause is\nthe origin of the effect, birth may be possible, just as a father might be born of a son.\nIV-16. If cause and effect be possible, the order (in which they originate) has to be found out by you,\nfor if they originate simultaneously, there is no relationship between the two, as is the case with the\nhorns of a cow.\nIV-17. Your cause that is produced from an effect cannot be established. How will a cause, that is itself\nnot established, produce an effect ?\nIV-18. If the cause emerges from the effect and if the effect emerges from the cause, which of the two\nhas arisen first on which depends the emergence of the other ?\nIV-19. Your inability (to reply) tantamounts to ignorance, or there will be a difference in the order of\nsuccession (postulated by you). Thus indeed is the absence of birth revealed by the wise in all manner.\nIV-20. What is called the illustration of a seed and a sprout is always equal to the major term (yet to be\nproved). The middle term (viz., the illustration) that is equal to the unproved major term, cannot be\napplied for establishing a proposition yet to be proved.\nIV-21. The ignorance regarding antecedence and succession reveals birthlessness. From a thing that is\nborn, why is it that its antecedent cause is not comprehended ?\nIV-22. Nothing whatsoever is born either of itself or of something else. Similarly, nothing whatsoever\nis born whether it be existent or non-existent or both existent and non-existent.\nIV-23. A cause is not born of an effect that is beginningless, nor does an effect take birth naturally\n(from a cause that is beginningless). For that which has no cause has no birth also.\nIV-24. Knowledge has its object, since otherwise it brings about the destruction of duality. Besides,\nfrom the experience of pain, the existence of external objects, as upheld by the system of thought of the\nopponents, is admitted.\nIV-25. In accordance with the perception of the cause of knowledge, the latter is deemed to be based on\nexternal objects. But from the point of view of reality, the (external) cause is regarded as no cause.\nIV-26. Consciousness is not in contact with objects nor is it in contact with the appearances of objects.\nFor the object is certainly non-existent and (the ideas constituting) the appearances of object are not\nseparate from consciousness.\nIV-27. Consciousness does not ever come in contact with objects in the three periods of time. Without a\ncause (ie., external object) how can there be its false apprehension ?\nIV-28. Therefore consciousness is not born, nor are things perceived by it born. Those who perceive it\nas having birth, may as well see footprints in the sky.\nIV-29. Since it is the birthless that is born (in the view of the disputants), birthlessness is its nature.\nHence deviation from this nature can happen in no way whatsoever.\nIV-30. If transmigratory existence be beginningless, its termination will not be reached. And liberation\nwill not be eternal, if it has a beginning.\nIV-31. That which is non-existent in the beginning and the end is definitely so in the present. The\nobjects, although similar to the unreal, look as though real.\nIV-32. Their utility is opposed in dream. Therefore, for the reasons of their having a beginning and an\nend, they are definitely remembered to be unreal.\n\nIV-33.All objects are unreal in dream, inasmuch as they are seen within the body. In this narrow space,\nhow is the vision of creatures possible ?\nIV-34. It is not reasonable to say that objects in dream are seen by (actually) going to them, since it\nruns counter to the regulation of time that is needed for the journey. Further, none, when awake,\nremains in the place of dream.\nIV-35. (In dream) what has been discussed with friends and others (and settled) is not resorted to when\nawake. Whatsoever is acquired (in dream0, too, is not seen when awake.\nIV-36. And in dream the body becomes unreal, since another body is seen (in the bed). As is the body,\nso is everything cognised by the consciousness \u2013 all unreal.\nIV-37. Since the experience (of objects) in dream is just like that in the waking state, the former is\nthought of as being caused by the latter. Such being the case, the waking state is considered to be real\nfor that dreamer alone.\nIV-38. Such birth is not established, everything is said to be unborn. Besides, it is not possible for the\nunreal to be born from the real, in any way whatsoever.\nIV-39. Having seen unreal things in the waking state, one, deeply impressed, sees those very things in\ndream. Likewise, having seen unreal objects in dream, one does not see them when awake.\nIV-40. There is no non-existent that serves as the cause of the non-existent, in the same way as the\nexistent does not serve as the cause of the non-existent. There is no real entity that serves as the cause\nof another real entity. How can the unreal be the product of the real ?\nIV-41. Just as one, for want of discrimination, takes unthinkable objects in the waking state as real, so\ntoo, in dream, one sees things in that state alone, for want of discrimination.\nIV-42. For those who, from their own experience and right conduct, believe in the existence of\nsubstantiality, and who are ever afraid of the birthless, instruction regarding birth has been imparted by\nthe wise.\nIV-43. For those who, for fear of the Unborn, and also owing to their perception (of duality), deviate\nfrom the right path, the evil springing up from acceptance of birth (creation), does not accrue. The evil\neffect, if there be any, will be but little.\nIV-44. Just as an elephant magically conjured up is called an elephant by relying on perception and\nright conduct, similarly, for reasons of perception and right conduct a thing is said to be existing.\nIV-45. That which bears semblance of birth, appears as though moving, and, similarly seems to be a\nthing (of attributes), is Consciousness that is birthless, unmoving and non-material, serene and nondual.\nIV-46. Thus Consciousness is unborn; thus the souls are regarded to be unborn. Those who realise thus\ncertainly do not fall into misfortune.\nIV-47. Just as the fire-brand set in motion appears as straight, crooked etc., similarly, the vibration of\nConsciousness appears as the perceiver and the perceived.\nIV-48. Just as the fire-brand devoid of motion is without appearances and birth, so also Consciousness\ndevoid of vibration is without appearances and birth.\nIV-49. When the fire-brand is in motion, the appearances do not come from elsewhere. Neither do they,\nwhen the fire-brand is free from motion, go elsewhere, nor do they enter into it.\nIV-50. They did not go out of the fire-brand owing to their not being of the nature of substance. In the\ncase of Consciousness, too, the appearances must be the same, for as appearance there can be no\ndistinction.\nIV-51. When Consciousness is in motion, the appearances do not come from elsewhere. Neither do\nthey, when the Consciousness is free from motion, go elsewhere, nor do they enter again into It.\nIV-52. They did not go out of Consciousness owing to their not being of the nature of substance, for\nthey ever remain incomprehensible on account of the absence of relation of effect and cause.\nIV-53. A substance could be the cause of a substance and another could be the cause of any other thing.\nBut the souls cannot be regarded either as substances or as some other thing different from all else.\n\nIV-54. Thus external objects are not born of Consciousness; nor is Consciousness born of external\nobjects. Thus have the wise settled the birthlessness of cause and effect.\nIV-55. As long as there is fascination for cause and effect, so long do cause and effect come into\nexistence. When the fascination for cause and effect ceases, there is no further springing up of cause\nand effect.\nIV-56. As long as one is completely absorbed in cause and effect, so long does transmigration continue.\nWhen the absorption in cause and effect ceases, one does not undergo transmigration.\nIV-57. From the relative plane (of thinking) everything seems to be born and is not, therefore, eternal.\nFrom the absolute plane (of perception) everything is the unborn (Self) and there is, therefore, nothing\nlike destruction.\nIV-58. The souls that are thus born are not born in reality. Their birth is like that of an object through\nMaya. And that Maya again is non-existent.\nIV-59. Just as from a magical seed comes out a sprout of that very nature which is neither permanent\nnor destructible, so too, is the reasoning applicable in respect of objects.\nIV-60. In the case of all birthless entities the terms permanent and non-permanent can have no\napplication. Where words fail to describe, no entity can be spoken of in a discriminative manner.\nIV-61. As in dream Consciousness vibrates through illusion, as though dual by nature, so in the waking\nstate Consciousness vibrates through illusion as though possessed of dual appearances.\nIV-62. There can be no doubt that the non-dual Consciousness alone appears in dream as though dual.\nSimilarly, in waking state, too, the non-dual Consciousness appears as though dual, undoubtedly.\nIV-63. The dreamer, as he wanders in the dream-land always sees the creatures born from eggs or from\nmoisture as existing in all the ten directions.\nIV-64. These (creatures), perceptible to the consciousness of the dreamer, have no existence apart from\nhis consciousness. So also this consciousness of the dreamer is admitted to be the object of perception\nto that dreamer alone.\nIV-65. The man in the waking state, as he wanders in the places of the waking state, always sees the\ncreatures born from eggs or from moisture as existing in all the ten directions.\nIV-66. These (creatures), perceptible to the consciousness of the man in the waking state, have no\nexistence apart from his consciousness. So also, this consciousness of the man in the waking state is\nadmitted to be the object of perception to that man of the waking state alone.\nIV-67. Both these are perceptible to each other. \"Does it exist?\" (To such a question) \"No\" is said (by\nway of answer). Both these are devoid of valid proof, and each can be perceived only through the idea\nof the other.\nIV-68. Just as a creature seen in dream takes birth and dies, so also do all these creatures come into\nbeing and disappear.\nIV-69. Just as a creature conjured up by magic takes birth and dies, so also do all these creatures come\ninto being and disappear.\nIV-70. Just as an artificial creature (brought into being by incantation and medicine), takes birth and\ndies, so also do all these creatures come into being and disappear.\nIV-71. No creature whichsoever is born, nor is there any source for it. This is that supreme truth where\nnothing is born whatsoever.\nIV-72. This duality consisting in the subject-object relationship is nothing but the vibration of\nConsciousness. Again, Consciousness is without object and is, therefore, declared to be ever\nunattached.\nIV-73. That which exists by virtue of being an imagined empirical view, does not exist in reality. Again,\nthat which exists on the basis of the empirical view brought about by other schools of thought, does not\nreally exist.\nIV-74. Inasmuch as the soul, according to the conclusions arrived at by other schools of thought, takes\nbirth from a fancied empirical view point, it is said in consistence with that empirical point of view that\n\nthe soul is unborn; but from the point of view of supreme Reality, it is not even unborn.\nIV-75. There is a mere fascination for unreal things, though there exists no duality. Having realised the\nabsence of duality, one is not born again for want of a cause.\nIV-76. When there are no causes \u2013 superior, inferior or medium \u2013 then Consciousness does not take\nbirth. How can there be any result when the cause is absent.\nIV-77. The birthlessness of Consciousness which is free from causes is constant and absolute, for all\nthis (ie., duality and birth) was an object of perception to It which had been unborn (even before).\nIV-78. Having realised the Truth that is uncaused and having abstained from obtaining any further\ncause, one attains the state of fearlessness that is devoid of grief and delusion (kama).\nIV-79. Owing to fascination for unreal objects, Consciousness engages Itself in things that are equally\nunreal. On realisation of the non-existence of objects, Consciousness, becoming free from attachment,\nabstains (from them).\nIV-80. Then, there follows a state of stillness, when the Consciousness has become free from\nattachment and does not engage Itself (in unreal things). That is the object of vision to the wise. That is\nthe (supreme) state on non-distinction, and that is birthless and non-dual.\nIV-81. This is birthless, sleepless, dreamless, and self-luminous. For this Entity (the Self) is ever\nluminous by Its very nature.\nIV-82. Owing to the Lord\u2019s fondness for any object whatsoever, he becomes ever veiled effortlessly,\nand is unveiled every time with strenuous effort.\nIV-83. A man of puerile imagination definitely covers the Self by affirming that It \"exists\", exists not\",\n\"Exists and exists not\", or again, \"exists not\", \"exists not\", and by possessing such views as (that It is)\nchanging and unchanging, both changing and unchanging and non-existent.\nIV-84. These are the four alternative views, owing to a fascination for which the Lord becomes ever\nhidden. He is the all-seer by whom is the Lord perceived as untouched by these.\nIV-85. Having attained omniscience in its entirety, as well as the non-dual state of Brahmanhood that is\ndevoid of beginning, middle, and end, does anyone wish anything thereafter ?\nIV-86. This is the humility of the Brahmanas; this is said to be their natural control. Since, by nature,\nthey have conquered the senses, this is their restraint. Having known thus, the enlightened one becomes\nrooted in tranquillity.\nIV-87. The duality that is co-existent with both object and (its) perception is said to be the ordinary\n(waking) state. That state where there is only perception without (the actual presence of an) object is\nsaid to be the ordinary (dream) state.\nIV-88. The state devoid of object and devoid of perception is regarded as extraordinary. Thus have the\nwise for ever declared knowledge, object, and the knowable.\nIV-89. On acquiring knowledge (of the threefold objects) and on knowing the objects in succession,\nthere follows consequently, for the man of great intellect here, the state of omniscience for ever.\nIV-90. Those which are to be abandoned, realised, adopted, and made ineffective should be known first.\nOf these, the three, excepting the thing to be realised, are regarded as mere imaginations born of\nignorance.\nIV-91. It should be known that all souls are, by nature, similar to ether, and eternal. There is no\ndiversity anywhere among them, even an iota of it.\nIV-92. All souls are, by nature, illumined from the very beginning, and their characteristics are well\nascertained. He, for whom there is thus the freedom from want of further acquisition of knowledge, is\nconsidered to be fit for immortality.\nIV-93. All souls are, from the very beginning, tranquil, unborn and, by nature, entirely detached, equal,\nand non-different, and inasmuch as Reality is thus unborn, unique, and pure, (therefore there is no need\nof tranquillity to be brought into the Self).\nIV-94. There cannot ever be any purification for those who always tread the path of duality. They\nfollow the path of difference, and speak of diversity and are, therefore, considered to be mean.\n\nIV-95. They who have well-settled convictions regarding that which is unborn and ever the\nsame,indeed are possessed of great knowledge in this world. But the common man cannot comprehend\nit.\nIV-96. The knowledge existing in the birthless souls is regarded unborn and unrelated. Inasmuch as the\nknowledge has no relation with other objects, it is declared to be unattached.\nIV-97. If there be birth for a thing, however insignificant it may be, non-attachment shall never be\npossible for the ignorant man. What to speak (then) of the destruction of covering for him ?\nIV-98. All souls are devoid of any covering and are by nature pure. They are illumined as well as free\nfrom the beginning. Thus they are said to be masters since they are capable of knowing.\nIV-99. The knowledge of the one who is enlightened and all-pervasive, does not enter into objects. And\nso the souls also do not enter into objects. This fact was not mentioned by the Buddha.\nIV-100. Having realised the non-dual state that is hard to perceive, deep, unborn, uniform and\nserene,we offer our salutations to It, as best as we can.\nOm ! O gods, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious;\nMay we, while offering our praise to gods\nWith our bodies strong of limbs,\nEnjoy the life which the gods are pleased to grant us.\nMay Indra of great fame be well disposed to us;\nMay the all-knowing (or immensely wealthy) Pusha be propitious to us;\nMay Garuda, the vanquisher of miseries, be well pleased with us;\nMay Brihaspati grant us all prosperity.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Mandukyopanishad, included in the Atharva-Veda.\n\nMandukya Upanishad Commentary\nCommentary on the Mandukya Upanishad\u2013by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\nThe Shabda Brahman: Om\nOm is a principal subject in the eleven major upanishads, but the entire Mandukya Upanishad is\ndedicated to an explanation of Its meaning for the sadhaka. It wastes no time, but starts right at the\npinnacle, saying: \u201cThe syllable OM, which is the imperishable Brahman, is the universe. Whatsoever\nhas existed, whatsoever exists, whatsoever shall exist hereafter, is OM. And whatsoever transcends\npast, present, and future, that also is OM.\u201d (Mandukya Upanishad 1)\nThis is so vast, and yet at the same time so simple, that it renders comment impossible and unnecessary.\nThe essential point is the infinity of Om, because It is the infinite Brahman.\n\nThe four aspects of the Self\n\u201cAll this that we see without is Brahman. This Self that is within is Brahman. This Self, which is one\nwith OM, has three aspects, and beyond these three, different from them and indefinable\u2013The Fourth.\u201d\n(Mandukya Upanishad 2) The three aspects of those within relativity are waking, dreaming sleep, and\ndreamless sleep. Beyond these three is the pure consciousness itself known as turiya. This fourth state\nis the sole state of the liberated consciousness. Even if a liberated being reenters into relative existence\nfor the upliftment of those still caught in that net, he remains consciously centered in turiya and\nexperiences the three lower states only peripherally. When the turiya level overwhelms such a one we\nsay he has \u201cgone into samadhi,\u201d but in actuality he has simply become absorbed in his continual state,\nhaving momentarily dropped the flimsy dreams of relative existence which we think are so real and\nbinding. I have heard more than one disciple tell of their having to hold Yogananda up and help him\nwalk when toward the end of his earthly time he was continually flying upward into his true state.\nOften he would see his body moving along far below, as though he were soaring high in the sky.\n\u201cAs above, so below\u201d is a fundamental truth of the cosmos. What can be said of the macrocosm can\nalso be said of the microcosm. And since the Infinite and the finite are essentially one, the upanishad\nnow begins analyzing the three levels of the Cosmic Man.\nVaiswanara\n\u201cThe first aspect of the Self is the universal person, the collective symbol of created beings, in his\nphysical nature\u2014Vaiswanara. Vaiswanara is awake, and is conscious only of external objects. He has\nseven members. The heavens are his head, the sun his eyes, air his breath, fire his heart, water his belly,\nearth his feet, and space his body. He has nineteen instruments of knowledge: five organs of sense, five\norgans of action, five functions of the breath, together with mind, intellect, heart, and ego. He is the\nenjoyer of the pleasures of sense.\u201d (Mandukya Upanishad 3) This is an extremely explanatory\ntranslation, but all correct. The last statement: \u201cHe is the enjoyer of the pleasures of sense\u201d should\nreally be: \u201cHe is the experiencer of material things.\u201d Other than that, all is well, the idea being that God\nencompasses all perceptible being.\nTaijasa\n\u201cThe second aspect of the Self is the universal person in his mental nature\u2013Taijasa. Taijasa has seven\nmembers and nineteen instruments of knowledge. He is dreaming, and is conscious only of his dreams.\nIn this state he is the enjoyer of the subtle impressions in his mind of the deeds he has done in the past.\u201d\n(Mandukya Upanishad 4) Subconsciousness is the springboard from which all present action stems. We\nspeak of karma and samskara, the deeds of past lives and their effects, as producing all that we now\nexperience. Actually the field of the subconscious is sown with the seeds of the past that are destined to\ngerminate and manifest on the Vaiswanara level. So to separate Taijasa and Vaiswanara is impossible.\nThey are really only two aspects of a single thing. Further, there is a third aspect through which the\nunity of consciousness manifests itself: Prajna.\nPrajna\n\u201cThe third aspect of the Self is the universal person in dreamless sleep\u2013Prajna. Prajna dreams not. He is\nwithout desire. As the darkness of night covers the day, and the visible world seems to disappear, so in\ndreamless sleep the veil of unconsciousness envelops his thought and knowledge, and the subtle\nimpressions of his mind apparently vanish. Since he experiences neither strife nor anxiety, he is said to\nbe blissful, and the experiencer of bliss.\u201d (Mandukya Upanishad 5) Gambhirananda\u2019s translation brings\nout some more aspects of this: \u201cThat state is deep sleep where the sleeper does not desire any enjoyable\n\nthing and does not see any dream. The third quarter is Prajna who has deep sleep as his sphere, in\nwhom everything becomes undifferentiated, who is a mass of mere consciousness, who abounds in\nbliss, who is surely an enjoyer of bliss, and who is the doorway to the experience [of the dream and\nwaking states].\u201d\nWhat we have here is a picture of the third layer of experience that underlies the conscious and\nsubconscious levels of the mind. Not only is this layer undifferentiated because it is the raw material\nout of which the other two emerge, it is also the level of assimilation in which the changes of the two\nresolve back into their basic constituents. Therefore: \u201cPrajna is the lord of all. He knows all things. He\nis the dweller in the hearts of all. He is the origin of all. He is the end of all.\u201d (Mandukya Upanishad 6)\nThis is all true, and is a very exact description of our own personal level of prajna as well as the\nuniversal Prajna. This verse really sounds like a eulogistic definition of God in ordinary theistic\nreligion. But Sanatana Dharma is not ordinary religion, so it goes much further, far beyond the vistas of\n\u201cthe world\u2019s religions\u201d\u2013a kind of Freudian slip in its way, indicating that they spring from the world,\nfrom world-based consciousness. Rather the upanishad tells us of a fourth level of Being.\nTuriya: The Self\n\u201cThe Fourth, say the wise, is not subjective experience, nor objective experience, nor experience\nintermediate between these two, nor is it a negative condition which is neither consciousness nor\nunconsciousness. It is not the knowledge of the senses, nor is it relative knowledge, nor yet inferential\nknowledge. Beyond the senses, beyond the understanding, beyond all expression, is The Fourth. It is\npure unitary consciousness, wherein awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely\nobliterated. It is ineffable peace. It is the supreme good. It is One without a second. It is the Self. Know\nit alone!\u201d (Mandukya Upanishad 7) This is rather a huge lump for the intelligence to chew, swallow,\nand assimilate, because it mostly consists of what the mysterious Fourth\u2013the Turiya\u2013is not.\nProof\nThere is one point that for some reason is omitted (ignored) by Prabhavananda and other translators. In\nthis verse the Self is said to be eka atma pratyaya saram. Some translators have rendered it to mean\nthat the Turiya is the essence, the sole factor, of the Self. And of course this is the truth. But Shankara\nsays something quite interesting. He says this phrase means that the proof or evidence of this Fourth is\nthe very belief in its existence! What he means is that when the deep conviction arises from within the\nconsciousness that the Turiya exists it is not a matter of reason\u2013for reason stops at the stage of verse\nsix. Rather, it is a manifestation of the Self as well as the dawning in the individual\u2019s awareness of the\nTuriya\u2019s reality. It is a kind of primary or preliminary vision of the Self, and not at all a matter of the\nintellect (buddhi). Obviously, then, the truth about Turiya cannot really be taught to anyone\u2013it has to\narise own its own as a result of the individual drawing near to the Self. It is a matter of spiritual\nevolution alone.\nAnd here is the essence of the essence of subject: \u201cIt is the Self. Know it alone!\u201d\nOm\nThe upanishad is not dispensing mere theory to us, but knowledge meant to be put into practice and\nproven by that practice. So it continues: \u201cThis Self, beyond all words, is the syllable OM. This syllable,\nthough indivisible, consists of three letters\u2014A-U-M.\u201d (Mandukya Upanishad 8)\nThe Self, the Atman, is Om! If we knew only this fact and none other, we would possess the key to\nliberation. All the philosophy in the world, however profound or true, means absolutely nothing unless\n\nwe can experience the truth and be freed from the effects of ignorance: karma and rebirth. Om is the\nmeans of experience and freedom.\nOm is also considered to be formed of the three letters a, u, and m, which represent the three states of\nwaking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep respectively, as well as the physical, astral, and causal levels of\nexistence. In Sanskrit, when a and u are combined they produce the sound of o. However, this only\napplies to verbal speech. In mental \u201cspeaking\u201d we make the pure sound of o, not a and u together. So\ninwardly Om is only two letters, not three. Nevertheless, the upanishad is considering the three-letter\nform because Om contains within Itself the three states of conscious that have been discussed, and Om\nis the way to access and unify the three.\n\u201cVaiswanara, the Self as the universal person in his physical being, corresponds to the first letter\u2013A.\nWhosoever knows Vaiswanara obtains what he desires, and becomes the first among men.\u201d (Mandukya\nUpanishad 9) He who masters the waking state through the japa and meditation of Om also masters the\nmaterial world and becomes himself a master among men\u2013not of men, but among men, for sages have\nno wish to control others though they gladly tell us how to control ourselves. The desires of such\nmasters are fulfilled because they are intimately connected with the very essence of creation and\nwhatever they think can be realized. This is how they work miracles, even creating things if needed.\n\u201cTaijasa, the Self as the universal person in his mental being, corresponds to the second letter\u2014U.\nTaijasa and the letter U both stand in dream, between waking and sleeping. Whosoever knows Taijasa\ngrows in wisdom, and is highly honored.\u201d (Mandukya Upanishad 10) Sanskrit is capable of more than\none interpretation, and this verse can also say two very interesting things: 1) Such a master increases\nthe knowledge of humanity and even gives inner momentum to assist questing souls to access\nknowledge, and 2) he becomes one with all human beings in the sense that when they meet him they\nfeel that his is one with them\u2013one of them\u2013and they are so attuned and comfortable with him that they\nfeel he is virtually their own self. This is seen in the great saints. Whether a beggar or a king\napproaches them, they feel that they are their dear and their own. I saw and experienced this for myself\nwith Swami Sivananda. His greatness was cosmic; he was a virtual god upon the earth; and yet, I felt so\nat ease with him\u2013even though I was always in awe of him. How many times I have sat looking at his\nradiant countenance and thought: \u201cIf there is anyone in this world who loves me, it is this man.\u201d Of\ncourse he was \u201cman\u201d only in form. Within he was the divine Self. Yet he was so accessible and so easy\nto communicate with. He was as close to me as my Self\u2013for he was one with That Which is my Self.\nIt is important for us in the West to understand this aspect of holy people because we are so\nbrainwashed with the idea of power and control and much more impressed with the power to curse than\nthe power to bless. Rebuke, curse, deprecate, punish, torment, and destroy\u2013these are the \u201cways\u201d of the\nWestern \u201cGod\u201d who fortunately is a blasphemy and not a reality. No wonder Jesus said: \u201cMany will say\nto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out\ndevils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew\nyou: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\u201d (Matthew 7:22, 23)\nOm is the key to the subconscious, just as it is to the conscious, so through Om the master yogi knows\nall about himself and has no illusions about himself. He also knows all about others and understands\nthem. No one can fool him. I saw this in Sivananda, as well. He was always so kind, and often\nhumorous, but he went right to the truth of things in relation to people\u2019s foibles.\n\u201cPrajna, the Self as the universal person in dreamless sleep, corresponds to the third letter\u2014M. He is\nthe origin and the end of all. Whosoever knows Prajna knows all things.\u201d (Mandukya Upanishad 11)\nBeing one with the source and the ultimate goal of all, a self-realized being is omniscient because he\n\never dwells at the core of all\u2013past, present, and future.\nIn conclusion\nHaving said all these amazing things, the upanishad brings us back to the heart of it all: Om.\n\u201cThe Fourth, the Self, is OM, the indivisible syllable. This syllable is unutterable, and beyond\nmind. In it the manifold universe disappears. It is the supreme good\u2013One without a second.\nWhosoever knows OM, the Self, becomes the Self.\u201d (Mandukya Upanishad 12)\nGambhirananda: \u201cThe partless Om is Turiya\u2013beyond all conventional dealings, the limit of the\nnegation of the phenomenal world, the auspicious, and the non-dual. Om is thus the Self to be\nsure. He who knows thus enters the Self through his Self.\u201d\nThe partless Om. In its attempt to convey to our human intellects a bit of the glory of Om, the\nupanishad has considered It as having four aspects or \u201cparts,\u201d but in reality It is without parts, being\nabsolutely unitary in Its nature. So the upanishad reminds us of this lest we mistake its intent and\nmeaning. Just as we sometimes have to speak inaccurately to children to get our ideas across, so has the\nupanishad done with us. But now it corrects any wrong impression we may have gotten.\nBeyond all conventional dealings. Swami Nikhilananda renders this: \u201cwithout relationship,\u201d meaning\nthat we cannot \u201cdeal\u201d with God as we do with a material object or another human being. Nor can it be\nspoken about as It really is, for It lies beyond phenomena\u2013although It is the source of phenomena. We\ncannot \u201crelate\u201d to God, but we can know our oneness with God when we ourselves pass beyond all\ndual relationships.\nThe limit of the negation of the phenomenal world. We must realize that the Self is absolutely like\nnothing we know in relative existence, and therefore It is beyond the reach of any words. That is the\nintellectual side of the situation. On the metaphysical side we have to negate all \u201cthings\u201d from our\nconsciousness that we find in the phenomenal world.\nThe auspicious. Lest we think this is a losing or a giving up of something worthwhile, the upanishad\ntells us that the Self is the truly auspicious, the truly fortunate, and producing good fortune. We really\nonly give up and negate a mirage in exchange for The Real.\nThe non-dual. The Real being non-dual, we discover that It is us! So we not only gain everything, we\nexperience it as being us. We recognize ourselves as truly being \u201cthe kingdom, the power, and the\nglory.\u201d\nOm is thus the Self to be sure. Om reveals the truth of what the upanishad is telling us. Om is not a\nsymbol or designator of the Self, It IS the Self. This can be known.\nHe who knows thus enters the Self through his Self. We enter into our true Being through the japa and\nmeditation of Om\u2013which is our eternal Self. There is no greater or higher knowledge than the\nknowledge of Om. And now the upanishad has given us that knowledge.\nEnd of Mandukya Commentary",

May spiritual pre-eminence be vouchsafed to both of us\ntogether. Now therefore, we shall state the meditation on juxtaposition through five categories \u2013\nrelating to the worlds, to the shining things, to knowledge, to progeny, and to the body. These, they call\nthe great juxtapositions. Now then, as regards the meditation on the worlds. The earth is the first letter.\nHeaven is the last letter. The sky is the meeting-place.\nI-iii-2-4: Vayu is the link. This is the meditation with regard to the worlds. Then follows the meditation\nwith regard to the shining things. Fire is the first letter. The sun is the last letter. Water is the rallying\npoint. Lightning is the link. This is the meditation with regard to the shining things. Then follows the\nmeditation with regard to knowledge. The teacher is the first letter. The student is the last letter.\n\nKnowledge is the meeting-place. Instruction is the link. This is the meditation with regard to\nknowledge. Then follows the meditation with regard to progeny. The mother is the first letter. The\nfather is the last letter. The progeny is the focal point. Generation is the link. This is the meditation with\nregard to progeny. Then follows the meditation with regard to the (individual) body. The lower jaw is\nthe first letter. The upper jaw is the last letter.

Of them Mahacamasya knew a\nfourth one \u2013 Maha by name. It is Brahman; it is the Self. The other gods are the limbs. Bhuh, indeed, is\nthis world. Bhuvah is the intermediate space. Suvah is the other world. Maha is the sun; through the\nsun, indeed, do all the worlds flourish. Bhuh, indeed is the fire. Bhuvah is the air. Suvah is the sun.\nMaha is the moon; through the moon, indeed, all the luminaries flourish. Bhuh, indeed, is the Rig-Veda.\nBhuvah is the Sama-Veda. Suvah is the Yajur-Veda.\nI-v-3: Maha is Brahman (i.e. Om), for by Brahman (Om), indeed, are all the Vedas nourished. Bhuh,\nindeed, is Prana; Bhuvah is Apana; Suvah is Vyana; Maha is food; for by food, indeed, are all the vital\nforces nourished. These, then, that are four, are (each) fourfold. The Vyahritis are divided into four\ngroups of four (each). He who knows these knows Brahman. All the gods carry presents to him.\nI-vi-1-2: In the space that there is in the heart, is this Person who is realisable through knowledge, and\nwho is immortal and effulgent. This thing that hangs down between the palates like a teat, through it\nruns the path of Brahman; and reaching where the hairs part, it passes out by separating the skulls.\n(Passing out through that path, a man) becomes established in Fire as the Vyahriti Bhuh; he becomes\nestablished in Air as the Vyahriti Bhuvah; in the sun as the Vyahriti Suvah; in Brahman as the Vyahriti\nMahah. He himself gets independent sovereignty; he attains the lord of the mind; he becomes the ruler\nof speech, the ruler of eyes, the ruler of ears, the ruler of knowledge. Over and above all these he\nbecomes Brahman which is embodied in Akasa, which is identified with the gross and the subtle and\nhas truth as Its real nature, which reveals in life, under whose possession the mind is a source of bliss,\nwhich is enriched with peace and is immortal. Thus, O Pracinayogya, you worship.\n\nI-vii-1: The earth, sky, heaven, the primary quarters, and the intermediate quarters; fire, air, the sun, the\nmoon, and the stars; water, herbs, trees, sky, and Virat \u2013 these relate to natural factors. Then follow the\nindividual ones: Prana, Vyana, Apana, Udana and Samana; the eye, the ear, the mind, speech and sense\nof touch; skin, flesh, muscles, bones and marrow. Having imagined these thus, the seer said, \u201cAll this is\nconstituted by five factors; one fills up the (outer) fivefold ones by the (individual) fivefold ones.\nI-viii-1: Om is Brahman. Om is all this. Om is well known as a word of imitation (i.e. concurrence).\nMoreover, they make them recite (to the gods) with the words, \u201cOm, recite (to the gods)\u201d. They\ncommence singing Samas with Om. Uttering the words \u201cOm som\u201d they recite the Shastras. The (priest)\nBrahma approves with the word Om. One permits the performance of the Agnihotra sacrifice with the\nword Om. A Brahmana, when about to recite the Vedas utters Om under the idea, I shall attain\nBrahman\u201d. He does verily attain Brahman.\nI-ix-1: Righteousness and learning and teaching (are to be practised). Truth and learning and teaching\n(are to be practised). Austerity and learning and teaching (are to be resorted to). Control of the outer\nsenses and learning and teaching (are to be practised). Control of the inner organs and learning and\nteaching (are to be resorted to). The fires (are to be lighted up), and learning and teaching (are to be\nfollowed). The Agnihotra (is to be performed), and learning and teaching (are to be carried on). Guests\n(are to be entertained), and learning and teaching (are to be practised). Social good conduct (is to be\nadhered to), and learning and teaching (are to be practised). Children (are to be begotten), and learning\nand teaching (are to carried on). Procreation and learning and teaching (are to carried on). A grandson\n(is to be raised), and learning and teaching (are to be practised). Truth (is the thing) \u2013 this is what\nSatyavacha, of the line of Rathitara, thinks. Austerity (is the thing) \u2013 this is what Taponitya, son of\nPurusisti, thinks. Learning and teaching alone (are the things) \u2013 this is what Naka, son of Mudgala,\nthinks. For that indeed is the austerity; for that indeed is the austerity.\nI-x-I: I am the invigorator of the tree (of the world). My fame is high like the ridge of a mountain. My\nsource is the pure (Brahman). I am like that pure reality (of the Self) that is in the sun. I am the\neffulgent wealth. I am possessed of a fine intellect, and am immortal and undecaying. Thus was the\nstatement of Trisanku after the attainment of realisation.\nI-xi-1: Having taught the Vedas, the preceptor imparts this post-instruction to the students: \u201cSpeak the\ntruth. Practise righteousness. Make no mistake about study. Having offered the desirable wealth to the\nteacher, do not cut off the line of progeny. There should be no inadvertence about truth. There should\nbe no deviation from righteous activity. There should be no error about protection of yourself. Do not\nneglect propitious activities. Do not be careless about learning and teaching.\nI-xi-2-4: There should be no error in the duties towards the gods and manes. Let your mother be a\ngoddess unto you. Let your father be a god unto you. Let your teacher be a god unto you. Let your\nguest be a god unto you. The works that are not blameworthy are to be resorted to, but not the others.\nThese actions of ours that are commendable are to be followed by you, but not the others. You should,\nby offering seats, remove the fatigue of those Brahmanas who are more praiseworthy among us. The\noffering should be with honour; the offering should not be with dishonour. The offering should be in\nplenty. The offering should be with modesty. The offering should be with awe. The offering should be\nwith sympathy. Then, should you have any doubt with regard to duties or customs, you should behave\nin those matters just as Brahmanas do, who may happen to be there and who are able deliberators, who\nare adepts in those duties and customs, who are not directed by others, who are not cruel, and who are\ndesirous of merit. Then, as for the accused people, you should behave with regard to them just as the\nBrahmanas do, who may happen to be there and who are able deliberators, who are adepts in those\n\nduties and customs, who are not directed by others, who are not cruel, who are desirous of merit. This\nis the injunction. This is the instruction. This is the secret of the Vedas. This is divine behest. This is\nhow the meditation is to be done. This is how this must be meditated on.\nI-xii-1: May Mitra be blissful to us. May Varuna be blissful to us. May Aryaman be blissful to us. May\nIndra and Brihaspati be blissful to us. May Vishnu, of long strides, be blissful to us. Salutation to\nBrahman. Salutation to you, O Vayu. You, indeed, are the immediate Brahman. You alone I shall call\nthe direct Brahman. I shall call you righteousness. I shall call you truth. May He protect me. May He\nprotect the teacher. May He protect me. May He protect the teacher. Om, peace, peace, peace !\nBrahmananda Valli\nII-i: May He protect us both together. May He nourish us both together. May we both acquire strength\ntogether. Let our study be brilliant. May we not cavil at each other.\nOm! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nII-i-1: The knower of Brahman attains the highest. Here is a verse uttering that very fact: \u201cBrahman is\ntruth, knowledge, and infinite. He who knows that Brahman as existing in the intellect, lodged in the\nsupreme space in the heart, enjoys, as identified with the all - knowing Brahman, all desirable things\nsimultaneously.\nFrom that Brahman, which is the Self, was produced space. From space emerged air. From air was born\nfire. From fire was created water. From water sprang up earth. From earth were born the herbs. From\nthe herbs was produced food. From food was born man. That man, such as he is, is a product of the\nessence of food. Of him this indeed, is the head, this is the southern side; this is the northern side; this\nis the Self; this is the stabilising tail.\nHere is a verse pertaining to that very fact:\nII-ii-1: All beings that rest on the earth are born verily from food. Besides, they live on food, and at the\nend, they get merged in food. Food was verily born before all creatures; therefore it is called the\nmedicine for all, those who worship food as Brahman acquire all the food. Food was verily born before\nall creatures; therefore it is called the medicine for all. Creatures are born of food; being born, they\ngrow by food. Since it is eaten and it eats the creatures, it is called food.\nAs compared with this self made of the essence of food, as said before, there is another inner self which\nis made of air. By that is this one filled. This Self is also of the human form. Its human form takes after\nthe human form of that (earlier one). Of this, Prana is the head, Vyana is the southern side, Apana is the\nnorthern side, space is the self, the earth is the tail that stabilises. Pertaining to that is this (following)\nverse:\nII-iii-1: The senses act by following the vital force in the mouth; all human beings and animals that are\nthere act similarly; since on the vital force depends the life of all creatures, therefore it is called the life\nof all; those who worship the vital force as Brahman, attain the full span of life; since on the vital force\ndepends the life of all, it is called the life of all.\nOf the preceding (physical) one, this one, indeed, is the embodied self. As compared with this vital\nbody, there is another internal self constituted by mind. By that one is this one filled up. That self\nconstituted by mind is also of a human shape. The human shape of the mental body takes after the\nhuman shape of the vital body. Of the mental body, the Yajur-mantras are the head. The Rig-mantras\nare the right side, the Sama-mantras are the left side, the Brahmana portion is the self (trunk), the\nmantras seen by Atharvangiras are the stabilising tail. Pertaining to this there is a verse:\nII-iv-1: One is not subjected to fear at any time if one knows the Bliss that is Brahman failing to reach\nwhich (Brahman, as conditioned by the mind), words, along with the mind, turn back.\nOf that preceding (vital) one, this (mental one is verily the embodied self. As compared with this\n\nmental body, there is another internal self constituted by valid knowledge. By that one is this one filled\nup. This one as aforesaid, has verily a human shape. It is humanly shaped in accordance with the\nhuman shape of the earlier one. Of him faith is verily the head; righteousness is the right side; truth is\nthe left side; concentration is the self (trunk); (the principle, called) Mahat, is the stabilising tail.\nPertaining to this, here is a verse:\nII-v-1: Knowledge actualises a sacrifice, and it executes the duties as well. All the gods meditate on the\nfirst-born Brahman, conditioned by knowledge. If one knows the knowledge-Brahman, and if one does\nnot err about it, one abandons all sins in the body and fully enjoys all enjoyable things.\nOf that preceding (mental) one this (cognitive one) is verily the embodied self. As compared with this\ncognitive body, there is another internal self constituted by bliss. By that one is this one filled up. This\none, as aforesaid, has verily a human shape. It is humanly shaped in accordance with the human shape\nof the earlier one. Of him joy is verily the head, enjoyment is the right side, hilarity is the left side; bliss\nis the self (trunk). Brahman is the tail that stabilises. Apropos of this here is a verse:\nII-vi-1: If anyone knows Brahman as non-existing, he himself becomes non-existent. If anyone knows\nthat Brahman does exist, then they consider him as existing by virtue of that (knowledge).\nOf that preceding (blissful) one, this one is the embodied self. Hence hereafter follow these questions:\nAfter departing (from here) does any ignorant man go to the other world (or does he not) ?\nAlternatively, does any man of knowledge, after departing (from here) reach the other world (or does\nhe not) ?\nHe (the Self) wished, \u201cLet me be many, let me be born. He undertook a deliberation. Having\ndeliberated, he created all this that exists. That (Brahman), having created (that), entered into that very\nthing. And having entered there, It became the formed and the formless, the defined and the undefined,\nthe sustaining and the non-sustaining, the sentient and the insentient, the true and the untrue. Truth\nbecame all this that there is. They call that Brahman Truth. Pertaining to this, there occurs this verse:\nII-vii-1: In the beginning all this was but the Unmanifested (Brahman). From that emerged the\nmanifested. That Brahman created Itself by Itself. Therefore It is called the self-creator.\nThat which is known as the self-creator is verily the source of joy; for one becomes happy by coming\nin contact with that source of joy. Who, indeed, will inhale, and who will exhale, if this Bliss be not\nthere in the supreme space (within the heart). This one, indeed, enlivens (people). For whenever an\naspirant gets fearlessly established in this un-perceivable, bodiless, inexpressible, and un-supporting\nBrahman, he reaches the state of fearlessness. For, whenever the aspirant creates the slightest difference\nin It, he is smitten with fear. Nevertheless, that very Brahman is a terror to the (so-called) learned man\nwho lacks the unitive outlook.\nIllustrative of this is this verse here:\nII-viii-1-4: Out of His fear the Wind blows. Out of fear the Sun rises. Out of His fear runs Fire, as also\nIndra, and Death, the fifth.\nThis, then, is an evaluation of that Bliss:\nSuppose there is a young man \u2013 in the prime of life, good, learned, most expeditious, most strongly\nbuilt, and most energetic. Suppose there lies this earth for him filled with wealth. This will be one unit\nof human joy. If this human joy be multiplied a hundred times, it is one joy of the man-Gandharvas,\nand so also of a follower of the Vedas unaffected by desires. If this joy of the man-Gandharvas be\nmultiplied a hundred times, it is one joy of the divine-Gandharvas, and so also of a follower of the\nVedas unaffected by desires. If the joy of the divine-Gandharvas be increased a hundredfold, it is one\njoy of the manes whose world is everlasting, and so also of a follower of the Vedas unaffected by\ndesires. If the joy of the manes that dwell in the everlasting world be increased a hundredfold, it is one\n\njoy of those that are born as gods in heaven, and so also of a follower of the Vedas untouched by\ndesires. If the joy of those that are born as gods in heaven be multiplied a hundredfold, it is one joy of\nthe gods called the Karma-Devas, who reach the gods through Vedic rites, and so also of a follower of\nthe Vedas unaffected by desires. If the joy of the gods, called the Karma-Devas, be multiplied a\nhundredfold, it is one joy of the gods, and so also of a follower of the Vedas untarnished by desires. If\nthe joy of the gods be increased a hundred times, it is one joy of Indra, and so also of a follower of the\nVedas unaffected by desires. If the joy of Indra be multiplied a hundredfold, it is one joy of Brihaspati\nand so also of a follower of the Vedas unaffected by desires. If the joy of Brihaspati be increased a\nhundred times, it is one joy of Virat, and so also of a follower of the Vedas untarnished by desires. If\nthe joy of Virat be multiplied a hundred times, it is one joy of Hiranyagarbha, and so also of a follower\nof the Vedas unsullied by desires.\nII-viii-5: He that is here in the human person, and He that is there in the sun, are one. He who knows\nthus attains, after desisting from this world, this self made of food, attains this self made of vital force,\nattains this self made of mind, attains this self made of intelligence, attains this self made of bliss.\nExpressive of this there occurs this verse:\nII-ix-1: The enlightened man is not afraid of anything after realising that Bliss of Brahman, failing to\nreach which, words turn back along with the mind.\nHim, indeed, this remorse does not afflict: \u201cWhy did I not perform good deeds, and why did I perform\nbad deeds ? He who is thus enlightened strengthens the Self with which these two are identical; for it is\nhe, indeed, who knows thus, that can strengthen the Self which these two really are. This is the secret\nteaching.\nBhrigu Valli\nIII-i-1: Bhrigu, the well-known son of Varuna, approached his father Varuna with the (formal) request,\n\u201cO, revered sir, teach me Brahman\u201d. To him he (Varuna) said this: \u201cFood, vital force, eye, ear, mind,\nspeech \u2013 (these are the aids to knowledge of Brahman)\u201d. To him he (Varuna) said: \u201cCrave to know that\nfrom which all these beings take birth, that by which they live after being born, that towards which they\nmove and into which they merge. That is Brahman\u201d. He practised concentration. He, having practised\nconcentration,\nIII-ii-1: He realised food (i.e. Virat, the gross Cosmic person) as Brahman. For it is verily from food\nthat all these beings take birth, on food they subsist after being born and they move towards and merge\ninto food. Having realised that, he again approached his father Varuna with the (formal) request. \u201cO,\nrevered sir, teach me Brahman\u201d. To him he (Varuna) said: \u201cCrave to know Brahman through\nconcentration; concentration is Brahman\u201d. He practised concentration. He, having practised\nconcentration,\nIII-iii-1: He knew the vital force as Brahman; for from the vital force, indeed, spring all these beings;\nhaving come into being, they live through the vital force; they move towards and enter into the vital\nforce, Having known thus, he again approached his father Varuna with the (formal) request. \u201cO,\nrevered sir, teach me Brahman\u201d. To him he (Varuna) said: \u201cCrave to know Brahman through\nconcentration; concentration is Brahman\u201d. He practised concentration. Having practised concentration,\nIII-iv-1: He knew mind as Brahman; for from mind, indeed, spring all these beings; having been born,\nthey are sustained by mind; and they move towards and merge into mind. Having known that, he again\napproached his father Varuna with the (formal) request. \u201cO, revered sir, teach me Brahman\u201d. To him he\n(Varuna) said: \u201cCrave to know Brahman through concentration; concentration is Brahman\u201d. He\npractised concentration. Having practised concentration,\n\nIII-v-1: He knew knowledge as Brahman; for from knowledge, indeed, spring all these beings; having\nbeen born, they are sustained by knowledge; they move towards and merge in knowledge. Having\nknown that, he again approached his father Varuna with the (formal) request. \u201cO, revered sir, teach me\nBrahman\u201d. To him he (Varuna) said: \u201cCrave to know Brahman through concentration; concentration is\nBrahman\u201d. He practised concentration. Having practised concentration,\nIII-vi-1: He knew Bliss as Brahman; for from Bliss, indeed, all these beings originate; Having been\nborn, they are sustained by Bliss; they move towards and merge in Bliss. This knowledge realised by\nBhrigu and imparted by Varuna (starts from the food-self and) terminates in the supreme (Bliss),\nestablished in the cavity of the heart. He who knows thus becomes firmly established; he becomes the\npossessor of food and the eater of food; and he becomes great in progeny, cattle and the lustre of\nholiness, and great in glory.\nIII-vii-1: His vow is that, he should not deprecate food. The vital force is verily the food, and the body\nis the eater; for the vital force is lodged in the body. (Again, the body is the food and the vital force is\nthe eater, for) the body is fixed on the vital force. Thus (the body and vital force are both foods; and)\none food is lodged in another. He who knows thus that one food is lodged in another, gets firmly\nestablished. He becomes a possessor and an eater of food. He becomes great in progeny, cattle, and the\nlustre of holiness and great in glory.\nIII-viii-1: His vow is that he should not discard food. Water, indeed, is food; fire is the eater; for water\nis established on fire. (Fire is food and water is the eater, for) fire resides in water. Thus one food is\nlodged in another food. He who knows thus that one food is lodged in another, gets firmly established.\nHe becomes a possessor and an eater of food. He becomes great in progeny, cattle, and the lustre of\nholiness and great in glory.\nIII-ix-1: His vow is that he should make food plentiful. Earth is food; space is eater; for earth is placed\nin space. (Space is food; and earth is eater, for) space is placed on earth. Thus one food is lodged in\nanother food. He who knows thus that one food is lodged in another, gets firmly established. He\nbecomes a possessor and an eater of food. He becomes great in progeny, cattle, and the lustre of\nholiness and great in glory.\nIII-x-1-2: His vow is that he should not refuse anyone come for shelter. Therefore one should collect\nplenty of food by whatsoever means he may. (And one should collect food for the further reason that)\nthey say, \u201cFood is ready for him\u201d. Because he offers cooked food in his early age with honour, food\nfalls to his share in the early age with honour. Because he offers food in his middle age with medium\ncourtesy, food falls to his share in his middle age with medium honour. Because he offers food in his\nold age with scant esteem, food falls to his share in old age with scant consideration. To him who\nknows thus (comes the result as described).\n(Brahman is to be meditated on) as preservation in speech; as acquisition and preservation in exhaling\nand inhaling; as action in the hands; as movement in the feet; discharge in the anus. There are\nmeditations on the human plane.\nThen follow the divine ones. (Brahman is to be meditated on) as contentment in rain; as energy in\nlightning.\nIII-x-3-4: Brahman is to be worshipped as fame in beasts; as light in the stars; as procreation,\nimmortality, and joy in the generative organ; as everything in space. One should meditate on that\nBrahman as the support; thereby one becomes supported. One should meditate on that Brahman as\ngreat; thereby one becomes great. One should meditate on It as thinking; thereby one becomes able to\n\nthink. One should meditate on It as bowing down; thereby the enjoyable things bow down to one. One\nshould meditate on It as the most exalted; Thereby one becomes exalted. One should meditate on It as\nBrahman\u2019s medium of destruction; thereby the adversaries that envy such a one die, and so do the\nenemies whom this one dislikes.\nThis being that is in the human personality, and the being that is there in the sun are one.\nIII-x-5-6: He who knows thus, attains, after desisting from this world, this self made of food. After\nattaining this self made of food then, attaining this self made of vital force, then attaining this self made\nof mind, then attaining this self made of intelligence, then attaining this self made of bliss, and roaming\nover these worlds with command over food at will and command over all forms at will, he continues\nsinging this Sama song: \u201cHalloo ! Halloo ! Halloo ! I am the food, I am the food, I am the food; I am\nthe eater, I am the eater, I am the eater; I am the unifier, I am the unifier, I am the unifier; I am\n(Hiranyagarbha) the first born of this world consisting of the formed and the formless, I (as Virat) am\nearlier than the gods. I am the navel of immortality. He who offers me thus (as food), protect me just as\nI am. I, food as I am, eat him up who eats food without offering. I defeat (i.e. engulf) the entire\nuniverse. Our effulgence is like that of the sun. This is the Upanishad.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Taittiriyopanishad, included in the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.\n\nTaittiriya Upanishad Commentary\nCommentary on the Taittiriya Upanishad\u2013by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\nReflections On Brahman\nIn his translations of some upanishads Swami Prabhavananda omitted parts that were in such obscure\nlanguage that any attempt at translation would really only be speculation. He also omitted very\nrepetitious passages and those that dwelt with matters irrelevant to the knowledge of Brahman and the\nSelf. I think that if you get complete translations of those you will see he was quite justified in this.\nAnyhow, I am writing this to explain why in the references to the verses of this upanishad there will be\nsome jumping around.\n\nThou art indeed\u2026\n\u201cThou art indeed the manifested Brahman. Of thee will I speak. Thee will I proclaim in my\nthoughts as true. Thee will I proclaim on my lips as true.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 1:1:1)\nThis fervent profession of faith and fidelity seems quite simple, but when we consider what it entails, it\nis a high aspiration indeed. It is also strikingly in contrast to most of the upanishads, which continually\ninsist on the transcendence of Brahman and the impossibility of comprehending or speaking of It.\nWhile typing in the forgoing sentence my memory reached back to a time of blessed tranquility in the\nsacred city of Sukhtal in north India. Tradition says that the supreme Master Sukhadeva, the illumined\nson of Vyasa, came to Sukhtal and taught the dying King Parikshit the principles of Self-knowledge\nand liberation. Many centuries later I was in Sukhtal at a spiritual gathering (Samyan Saptah) under the\naegis of Sri Ma Anandamayi. One of the great souls (mahatmas) also gathered there was Sri Yogeshwar\nBrahmachari, a venerable saint of Bengal whom I had met and visited with before. Every day he would\nbe seated on the platform near Ma, sitting in profound meditation, not moving for hours or even\nseeming to breathe. The exception would be when he would give a daily talk on spiritual life. In the\nevening there would be a question-and-answer session with people putting questions to the various\nrenowned spiritual leaders on the platform. One evening, right after a famous Vedantin had given a\nrather lengthy answer to a question, Yogeshwar Brahmachari began to speak forcefully. In a matter of\nmoments the tranquil atmosphere was replaced by one of anger and suppressed violence\u2013toward him. It\nreally felt like they were about to physically attack and maul him, the only restraint being the presence\nof Ma Anandamayi.\nNaturally, the next morning found me seeking out Yogeshwar Brahmachari to find what had taken\nplace, since everything had been said in Hindi. I found him happily ensconced in a cowshed (!) where\nhe was sleeping on some straw placed on a stone ledge. I was very aware that not one of the other\nsavants sitting on the platform day after day would have tolerated such humble and primitive\nsurroundings. But Brahmachariji was very happy, as he could cuddle and talk to the little calf that was\ntethered nearby.\nAfter some time of giving our latest news to each other, I questioned him about the previous nights\u2019\nvolcanic near-explosion. He laughed merrily and told me that he had challenged and rebuked all the\n\u201cbig Advaitins (Non-dualists)\u201d sitting there, demanding to know why they harped all the time on the\ntranscendence of God and ignored the divine immanence. \u201cWhy do you keep telling these people who\nhave so many worldly involvements and problems that the world is unreal, that they should care\nnothing about it, and that to do otherwise is ignorance? In all these days I have not heard even one of\nyou say just one piece of practical advice that would help them live their lives and remember God.\nThey have come here at great inconvenience and expense, leaving their homes and work behind,\nseeking ways to keep from drowning in the world. And you just tell them the world is no more than a\ndream and to forget it! How could they forget it? How many children must they have to care for and\nhow many debts and obligations? What is wrong with you? Why can\u2019t you tell them how to better their\nlives and rise above their worries and fears? You expect them to honor and support you, but what use\nare you to anybody? You should be ashamed!\u201d He laughed and concluded: \u201cSo their Non-dual\n\u2018realization\u2019 and philosophy went out the window and they got very interested in a dualistic battle with\nme. If it had not been for Mataji being there I would have gotten some blows!\u201d The thought of the frail\nsaint being assailed by the \u201cbig Babas\u201d who were as robust as their tempers, was not a happy one. But\nmy dear friend was quite content with the situation, being firmly committed to the good sense\nembodied in this opening verse of the upanishad. What the Taittiriya Upanishad now will do is balance\nout the very true, though one-sided, teachings of some of the other upanishads regarding the nature of\n\nBrahman and the world.\nThou art indeed the manifested Brahman. First we must understand that the cosmos is NOT Maya.\nMaya is the illusion in our mind as to the nature of the cosmos and our relation to it. Maya is a product\nof our ignorance, it is our wrong seeing and acting. The world \u201cout there\u201d is not Maya. Maya is the\nworld \u201cin here\u201d\u2013in our mind. Maya is the product of ego. Once this inner veil has been destroyed, then\nwe see the world as God in manifestation. In reaction we then exult with the upanishadic sage, also\nsaying: \u201cThou art indeed the manifested Brahman!\u201d\nOf thee will I speak. This will consist of two ways of speaking: denying what the world is not and\naffirming what the world is. We will speak of the reality of the world as Brahman. We will also speak\nof the unreality in the minds of ignorant human beings and explain its nature as delusion. Further, we\nwill speak of the nature of the world as an evolutionary ladder, and explain how it is used by the yogi\nas the means of freedom and ascent.\nThee will I proclaim in my thoughts as true. We will see and know in our minds that which is real in the\nworld, always aware that it is not \u201cthe world\u201d at all, but Divinity Itself. This is a matter of knowing, not\nmere speaking or speculating.\nThee will I proclaim on my lips as true. And this truth will we both live and speak to others. The\nimportant point here is that we must know before we speak. Otherwise our words are just empty noise.\nThe true Knower revels in the affirmation expressed in this first verse.\n\nNecessary Lessons\nProtection\nAll sentient beings\u2013not just humans\u2013seek for security, for safety. \u201cShelter\u201d means a lot more than a\nplace out of the rain. It is commonly said that there is safety in numbers, but that it not true. There is\nonly one assurance of safety, and the next verse expresses it rightly:\n\u201cMay truth protect me, may it protect my teacher, may it protect us both. May glory come to us\nboth. May the light of Brahman shine in us both.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 1:1:1, 1:3:1)\nSatyam means truth, both relative and absolute, truthfulness, and Brahman Who is The Truth.\nObviously, this verse is referring mostly to Brahman, but simple truth in the sense of accuracy and\nhonesty is also implied. If Truth is possessed by both student and teaching, then it only follows that\nrenown (yashah) and the splendor of Brahman (Brahma-varchasam) will accrue to them as well.\nA lesson on Om\n\u201cThou art Brahman, one with the syllable OM, which is in all scriptures\u2013the supreme syllable,\nthe mother of all sound. Do thou strengthen me with true wisdom. May I, O Lord, realize the\nImmortal. May my body be strong and whole; may my tongue be sweet; may my ears hear only\npraise of thee. The syllable OM is verily thine image. Through this syllable thou mayest be\nattained. Thou art beyond the grasp of the intellect. Vouchsafe that I forget not what I have\nlearned in the scriptures.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 1:4:1)\nThis verse and those following are addressed to the Infinite, to Brahman, but there is a purpose for\nopening with a declaration that Brahman and Om are the same: what is going to be petitioned for can\nbe attained through the japa and meditation of Om. We should look at these verses in that context.\n\nThou art Brahman, one with the syllable OM, which is in all scriptures\u2013the supreme syllable, the\nmother of all sound. The more literal description is: \u201cThe Om that is the most exalted in the Vedas, that\npervades all words, and that emerged from the immortal Vedas as their quintessence.\u201d Om is the crown\njewel of the Vedas\u2013which includes the upanishads. All sound, including humans speech, is contained in\nOm\u2013is actually a variation of the root-sound (mula shabda) that is Om. All words, then, are\npermutations of Om. This indicates that the faculty of speech is the supreme faculty in human beings,\nthe one that most directly links them to their Divine Source\u2013that actually Om IS their Source. The\nquintessence of the Vedas is the Divine Vision which is their very basis. And Om is identical to that\nIllumination. No wonder, then, that Patanjali tells us that the japa and meditation of Om is the way to\nthe highest realization. (Yoga Sutras 1:28) Or that the Mundaka Upanishad urges us to \u201cdismiss other\nutterances.\u201d (Mundaka Upanishad 2.2.5) We should let go of the chitter-chatter of the mind and its\nirrelevant thoughts and constantly repeat Om. For the Mundaka Upanishad says in the next part of the\nverse: \u201cThis [Om] is the bridge to immortality.\u201d\nDo thou strengthen me with true wisdom. True wisdom is knowledge of the True (Sat), the knowledge\nof God. Nothing can impart such knowledge but God\u2013and Om is God. So It is the only way to that\nknowledge. Om is that \u201cone thing which, when known\u2026all is known.\u201d\nMay I, O Lord, realize the Immortal. Here, too, Om is the means. Swami Gambhirananda renders this\nphrase: \u201cMay I be the receptacle of immortality.\u201d If we continually fill our consciousness with the\ninvocation of Om we shall be vessels of immortality, of Brahman.\nMay my body be strong and whole; may my tongue be sweet; may my ears hear only praise of thee.\nThrough Om even our external, material life becomes spiritually glorified.\nThe syllable OM is verily thine image. Through this syllable thou mayest be attained. There is no need\nfor comment on this\u2013what we need is experience of its truth through our own spiritual practice.\nThou art beyond the grasp of the intellect. Vouchsafe that I forget not what I have learned in the\nscriptures. Since the nature of Brahman\u2013and therefore of Om, as well\u2013is beyond conception and words,\nit is only natural that we keep forgetting the Truth of them both, just as Arjuna kept forgetting the true\nnature of Krishna. Since right now we are not consciously established in the Being of Brahman/Om, the\nfact keeps slipping away from us. For that reason we need to set the scriptural statements regarding Om\nmost firmly in our minds. For the moment, at least, we need to let the sacred texts \u201cremember\u201d for us.\n\u201cThou art the source of all happiness and of all prosperity. Do thou come to me as the goddess\nof prosperity and shower thy blessings upon me. May the seekers after truth gather round me,\nmay they come from everywhere, that I may teach them thy word.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 1:4:2)\nOm is the Manifester of all, so It is the source of all abundance, spiritual and material. Lakshmi, the\nGoddess of Prosperity, is, like all the other \u201cgods,\u201d a symbol of Om. As we see here, there is no fault in\nthe yogi aspiring to material fulfillment so he can have his mind free to be fixed on the awareness of\nGod.\nIt is noteworthy that it is not only lawful to desire material welfare, we should also desire to impart to\nworthy souls around us the truth of \u201cThy Word\u201d\u2013Om. We should all to some extent be yogacharyas\u2013\nteachers of yoga. We must share our spiritual wealth with others. \u201cFreely ye have received, freely\ngive.\u201d (Matthew 10:8)\n\u201cMay I be a glory among men. May I be richer than the richest. May I enter into thee, O Lord;\nand mayest thou reveal thyself unto me. Purified am I by thy touch, O Lord of manifold forms.\n\nThou art the refuge of those who surrender themselves to thee. Reveal thyself to me. Make me\nthine own. I take my refuge in thee.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 1:4:3) This says a lot:\nMay I be a glory among men. This is not a bid for fame as some translators think. As Swami\nPrabhavananda understands, our desire must be to manifest glorious humanity on our way to divinity.\nEven if no one knows we exist, we can still through our sadhana be \u201ca glory among men.\u201d That is a\nworthy ambition, realized through Om.\nMay I be richer than the richest. This is done by possessing everything in Infinite Consciousness. What\nis mere money\u2013or even a mere universe\u2013in comparison to that? Om is Infinite Consciousness.\nMay I enter into thee, O Lord; and mayest thou reveal thyself unto me. \u201cO Adorable One, may I enter\ninto Thee. O Venerable One, enter into me.\u201d This is Gambhirananda\u2019s rendering. This is the great\n\u201cMeeting of the Twain.\u201d We unite with Om and Om unites with us.\nPurified am I by thy touch, O Lord of manifold forms.\n\u201cOm! This Syllable is Brahman. \u2026With frequent application of this divine sound he washes away the\nstains of the soul.\u201d (Amritabindu Upanishad 20)\n\u201cThe meditation on Om should not be discontinued. With this divine mantra one should meditate many\ntimes for ridding himself of his own impurities.\u201d (Amritanada Upanishad 20)\n\u201cThe Taraka-Nama [Om], annihilates all sins. The Supreme Brahman shines in him who takes to this\nTaraka-Nama.\u201d (Sannyasa Upanishad)\n\u201cThe Pranava [Om] burns away sins;\u2026Hence the Pranava removes all obstacles and destroys all\ndefects.\u201d (Varaha Upanishad 5:68,71)\n\u201cThe Pranava shall be recited and repeated by those who desire all their sins annihilated.\u201d (Shiva\nPurana, Vidyeshwarasamhita 17:15)\n\u201cJapa of Om purifies the mind.\u201d (Shiva Purana)\n\u201cIf the devotee repeats the Pranava he becomes pure.\u201d (Shiva Purana, Vidyeshwarasamhita 17:18)\n\u201cJust as the bow is the cause of the arrow\u2019s hitting the target, so Om is the bow that brings about the\nsoul\u2019s entry into the Immutable. For the soul when purified by the repetition of Om gets fixed in\nBrahman with the help of Om without any hindrance, just as an arrow shot from a bow gets transfixed\nin the target.\u201d (Shankara, Commentary on the Mundaka Upanishad)\nThou art the refuge of those who surrender themselves to thee. Om is the safe haven of the sadhaka.\nReveal thyself to me. It is by the experiencing of Om in its higher and higher (subtler and subtler) forms\nthat It is fully revealed and united with in meditation.\nMake me thine own. By ending all separation from Thee. Though we ask the divine blessing for this, it\nis our effort that enables the Pranava to truly be The Word of Life for us.\nI take my refuge in thee. As they often say in India: Japa-Tapa; japa-tapa; japa-tapa. By holding on to\nOm as \u201cdear life\u201d we enter into Life Itself.\nA lesson on Brahman\n\nNow Brahman is addressed in words of those that have crossed the sea of samsara and entered the\nharbor of the Supreme Self. Rather than obscure them with comments, I will give them just as they are\nfor your inspiration.\n\u201cThou art the Lord, immortal, self-luminous, and of golden effulgence, within the lotus of every\nheart. Within the heart art thou revealed to those that seek thee.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 1:6:1)\n\u201cHe who dwells in thee becomes king over himself. He controls his wandering thoughts. He\nbecomes master of his speech and of all his organs of sense. He becomes master of his intellect.\nThou art Brahman, whose form is invisible, like ether; whose Self is truth. Thou art perfect\npeace and immortality, the solace of life, the delight of the mind. May I worship thee!\u201d\n(Taittiriya Upanishad 1:6:2)\n\u201cOm is Brahman. OM is all. He who meditates on OM attains to Brahman.\u201d (Taittiriya\nUpanishad 1.8.1)\n\u201cHaving attained to Brahman, a sage declared: \u201cI am life. My glory is like the mountain peak. I\nam established in the purity of Brahman. I have attained the freedom of the Self. I am Brahman,\nself-luminous, the brightest treasure. I am endowed with wisdom. I am immortal,\nimperishable.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 1.10.1)\nA lesson on learning\nTo conclude the first part (adhyaya) of the upanishad, we are given a four-verse exhortation to a student\nwho is departing from the teacher\u2019s house after the completion of his study. It is fitting for all who are\ninvolved in \u201cthe world\u201d or society to any degree to take these words to heart. For without them we will\nlose our way, however much we may have read and learned.\n\u201cLet your conduct be marked by right action, including study and teaching of the scriptures; by\ntruthfulness in word, deed, and thought; by self-denial and the practice of austerity; by poise\nand self-control; by performance of the everyday duties of life with a cheerful heart and an\nunattached mind.\n\u201cSpeak the truth. Do your duty. Do not neglect the study of the scriptures. Do not cut the thread\nof progeny. Swerve not from truth. Deviate not from the path of good. Revere greatness.\u201d\n(Taittiriya Upanishad 1:11:1)\nIf we seriously intend to get anywhere in spiritual life, these principles will guarantee our success\u2013as\nsurely as their neglect or omission will guarantee our failure. Spiritual life is not a lark or a bit of spice\nto add to life. And absolutely it is not some emollient to make a negative and foolish life somehow\ntolerable. Many years ago at the beginning of the yoga boom sparked off by the Beatles I began\noutlining a book to be called Is Yoga For You? My intention was to warn people away from wasting\ntheir time with yoga if they intended to live a life incompatible with yoga\u2019s fundamental character. But\nI soon realized that it would be a waste of time to write a book for spiritual idlers and dabblers who\nreally would not care whether they succeeded or failed\u2013they just wanted a diversion and something to\nimpress others with, a topic for conversation. But now is the time for the facts to be set forth. I hope the\nauthority of the upanishads will carry sufficient weight.\nLet your conduct be marked by right action. There could be many lists of what constitutes right action,\nbut the best is that of Patanjali the master yogi:\n1. Ahimsa: non-violence, non-injury, harmlessness.\n\n2. Satya: truthfulness, honesty.\n3. Asteya: non-stealing, honesty, non-misappropriativeness.\n4. Brahmacharya: sexual continence in thought, word and deed as well as control of all the senses.\n5. Aparigraha: non-possessiveness, non-greed, non-selfishness, non-acquisitiveness.\n6. Shaucha: purity, cleanliness.\n7. Santosha: contentment, peacefulness.\n8. Tapas: austerity, practical (i.e., result-producing) spiritual discipline.\n9. Swadhyaya: introspective self-study, spiritual study.\n10. Ishwarapranidhana: offering of one\u2019s life to God.\nAhimsa involves gentleness, kindness, mercy, and abstinence from taking life\u2013a matter that necessitates\na vegetarian diet. Ishwarapranidhana is not just some noble or sentimental vowing of our life to God,\nbut a very real and practical manner of ordering our life so that every moment brings us closer to Godrealization, to union with God.\nIncluding study and teaching of the scriptures. Being justly weary of being beaten over the head by\n\u201cThe Word of God,\u201d both Westerners and Middle-Easterners naturally shy away from the idea of\nscriptural authority, whether the Torah, the Bible, or the Koran. But they misunderstand the very\nmotivation behind reverence for scriptures in the East. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism do not respect\ntheir spiritual texts because of who has spoken them or written them down. Rather, the value of the\nscriptures rest solely upon their practical value\u2013nothing else. For them, a principle is not true just\nbecause it is written in a holy book, rather it was written in the holy book because it was the truth\u2013a\ntruth an can be put to the test and demonstrated to be true. For example, water is not hydrogen and\noxygen because a science book says so; the book says so because it is true. The only reason we who\nfollow Eastern religions quote scriptures is because they say it so well\u2013often much clearer than we\ncould on our own. The upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita are masterpieces of concise expression.\nWorlds of meaning often lie within a single phrase, even a single word. The bottom line is this: the\nEastern scriptures WORK. For thousands of years multitudes have proven in their own life that\nPatanjali\u2019s list has practical value. And so can we. It is also our duty to teach what we know to others\nwho are sincere and qualified. Whether by informal conversation, giving of books to read, or formal\ninstruction, we must help others as we have been helped.\nBy truthfulness in word, deed, and thought. It is so important to realize that truth is not a verbal\nformula, but a way of life, a state of mind. We must live truthfully. Since God is the ultimate truth, we\nmust live \u201cgodly.\u201d\nBy self-denial. Here, too, the East means something totally different from the negative \u201cmortification\u201d\nof Western religion that is nothing more than an expression of self-loathing, a declaration of human\n\u201cvileness\u201d rather than the divine nature we \u201cOrientals\u201d know to be the truth of ourselves. In the East,\n\u201cself-denial\u201d means discipline and control of the egoic impulses to indulgence and laziness. It means\nnot slipping into the morass of sensuality and selfishness. Basically it is ignoring the false ego to foster\nthe true Self, the Spirit.\nAnd the practice of austerity. This is not \u201cmortification\u201d or \u201cpenance\u201d either. Tapasya is any practice\n\nwhich rouses up and expresses our inner virtue, which clears the way for the revelation of our divine\nnature. It is not \u201cself-denial\u201d in the Western sense, it is Self-affirmation through spiritual practices that\nproduce results in freeing us from ignorance and limitation.\nBy poise and self-control. I cannot recall ever hearing anyone exhort someone to cultivate dignity, we\nare so obsessed with the \u201cplain folks\u201d syndrome that we equate with democracy. How it can be\nconsidered a compliment to refer to someone as being \u201ccomfortable as an old shoe\u201d is quite beyond\nme\u2013perhaps an indication of my Eastern samskaras. The sadhaka should have dignity and even an\nintelligent reserve in dealing with others. This should arise from respect, both for himself and for\nothers. We need not be artificial and put on airs, acting like \u201cLady Bottomley\u2019s plush horse\u201d (a favorite\nexpression of my father), but we should act with self-respect and awareness. (It was called\n\u201ccircumspection\u201d in a more sensible era.) Anyway, you get the idea.\nBy performance of the everyday duties of life with a cheerful heart and an unattached mind. This is\npossible only for a yogi. Cheerfulness is a natural side-effect of valid yoga practice. When you see a\n\u201cyogi\u201d that is not happy and optimistic, then either the yoga is no good or it is not being practiced. I am\nnot speaking of the manic behavior of some \u201cyogis\u201d that were either cracked before they started yoga\nor the yoga cracked them. (I am referring to those that laugh raucously at the slightest expression of\nhumor, or grin/smile all the time no matter what. These are the \u201cyoga clowns\u201d whose motto seems to be\n\u201cHappy, Happy, Joy, Joy.\u201d I heard of a man who once remarked to some of these yoga-hebephrenics:\n\u201cYou know, the way you all smile all the time is spooky.\u201d When they responded by grinning all the\nmore he insisted: \u201cNo, I mean it\u2013IT IS REALLY SPOOKY!\u201d) As they say: spot the looney.\nYoga promotes cheerfulness, but so does \u201can unattached mind\u201d\u2013it may be the major factor. As the Gita\nsays: \u201cHe puts aside desire, offering the act to Brahman. The lotus leaf rests unwetted on water: he rests\non action, untouched by action.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 5:10)\nSpeak the truth. This is not easy, especially since you have to first know the truth. Patanjali claims that\na person who speaks absolute truth at absolutely all times will find that whatever he says will come to\nbe. Here is an example from the first chapter of the first edition of Autobiography of a Yogi available\nfrom Crystal Clarity Publishers:\n\u201cAnother early recollection is outstanding; and literally so, for I bear the scar to this day. My\nelder sister Uma and I were seated in the early morning under a neem tree in our Gorakhpur\ncompound. She was helping me with a Bengali primer, what time I could spare my gaze from\nthe near-by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched\na jar of ointment. I smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm.\n\u201c\u2018Why do you use medicine on a healthy arm?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Well, Sis, I feel I am going to have a boil tomorrow. I am testing your ointment on the spot\nwhere the boil will appear.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018You little liar!\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Sis, don\u2019t call me a liar until you see what happens in the morning.\u2019 Indignation filled me.\n\u201cUma was unimpressed, and thrice repeated her taunt. An adamant resolution sounded in my\nvoice as I made slow reply.\n\u201c\u2018By the power of will in me, I say that tomorrow I shall have a fairly large boil in this exact\nplace on my arm; and your boil shall swell to twice its present size!\u2019\n\n\u201cMorning found me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot; the dimensions of Uma\u2019s boil had\ndoubled. With a shriek, my sister rushed to Mother. \u2018Mukunda has become a necromancer!\u2019\nGravely, Mother instructed me never to use the power of words for doing harm. I have always\nremembered her counsel, and followed it.\n\u201cMy boil was surgically treated. A noticeable scar, left by the doctor\u2019s incision, is present today.\nOn my right forearm is a constant reminder of the power in man\u2019s sheer word.\n\u201cThose simple and apparently harmless phrases to Uma, spoken with deep concentration, had\npossessed sufficient hidden force to explode like bombs and produce definite, though injurious,\neffects. I understood, later, that the explosive vibratory power in speech could be wisely\ndirected to free one\u2019s life from difficulties, and thus operate without scar or rebuke.\u201d\nDo your duty. Dharma\u2013here translated \u201cduty\u201d\u2013is the way of life in accordance with the deep\nwellsprings of our personality\u2013karma and samskaras. These comprise our fundamental nature, our\nprakriti. Through our personal dharma, our swadharma, we most quickly unfold our inner potential and\nstimulate our spiritual consciousness. It is so much more than a mere observance of \u201cright and wrong,\u201d\n\u201cdo and don\u2019t.\u201d So important is dharma, that the Gita tells us: \u201cIt is better to do your own duty, however\nimperfectly, than to assume the duties of another person, however successfully. Prefer to die doing your\nown duty: the duty of another will bring you into great spiritual danger.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 3:35) This is\nobviously a very serious matter\nDo not neglect the study of the scriptures. This is not just a helpful hint, it is a major spiritual principle.\nTrue dharma is a lifelong study, and dharma is perfectly expressed in the eleven major upanishads (the\nIsha, Kena, Katha, Prashna, Mundaka, Mandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka,\nand Svetashvatara Upanishads), the Bhagavad Gita, the Yoga Sutras (Yoga Darshana), the Brahma\nSutras, and the commentaries on them by Shankara. The Gita should be a daily study of the sadhaka as\nit contains the essence of all the others in a most practical and easily understood manner. For centuries\nmany spiritual teachers in India have required their students to study the Gita daily. Much of the gross\nmisunderstanding of Hinduism, and Advaita in particular, would be eliminated if the Gita were\ncarefully studied and applied throughout the aspirant\u2019s life.\nDo not cut the thread of progeny. Now this is very, very meaningful. For centuries there has been the\nmisperception that the teachings of the upanishads are somehow the property of monastics\u2013that\nmonastics are at the top of the spiritual hierarchy in Indian spiritual tradition. NOT SO. Not one sage\nmentioned in the upanishads was monastic, nor was a single author of the scriptures listed in the\nforegoing paragraph a monastic. Sanatana Dharma is founded upon the vision of the rishis\u2013none of\nwhom were monastics. Sanatana Dharma propounds four ways of life that are fitting for seekers after\nliberation. Only one is that of the totally committed monastic. It is certainly true that through the\ncenturies monastics have been a major factor in the propagation of dharma, that the three schools of\nVedanta were formulated definitively by monastics. Shankara, whose commentaries are mentioned also\nin the foregoing list of philosophical works, was a monk of monks.\nNevertheless, the life of the rishis, who were married and \u201cin the world,\u201d is the norm of Sanatana\nDharma. Any philosophy incompatible with that is not dharma. At the same time, this also means that\nthere is no room for spiritually lazy (and cowardly) people who try to shirk or shrug off their spiritual\nobligations by saying: \u201cthat is for you monks.\u201d They do not want to be thought second-class citizens,\nbut they want to live in a second-class manner and leave the complete fulfilling of dharma to the\nmonks. Shame! There is only one spiritual life: the Yoga Life. Whatever the conditions or\ncircumstances, all are obliged to be yogis. Otherwise their dharma is a sham, whether monastic or non-\n\nmonastic.\nWhat does \u201cthe thread of progeny\u201d have to do with this? The clear implication is that a Sanatana\nDharmi (one who follows Sanatana Dharma) is duty-bound to marry, have children, and raise those\nchildren to also follow dharma\u2013and yoga. The exceptions are those that become monastics from their\nyouth or who have some impediment to leading a normal married life. \u201cFootloose and fancy free\u201d is not\nthe way of the rishis. There you will see that Sanatana Dharmis are directed to have children, along\nwith instructions on how to preserve brahmacharya in marriage (!). These are not the rules for monks,\nnor were they written by monks, as is clear. Behold for yourself how high the ideal is for ALL Sanatana\nDharmis, whatever their stage of life (ashrama). Those who do not want to bother should leave dharma\nalone and join some cheap religion that lets them do as they please. There is a lot of it about.\nSwerve not from truth. Patanjali says that the need for absolute truthfulness is \u201cnot conditioned by\nclass, place, time or occasion, and extending to all stages.\u201d One sign of a sociopath is the belief that he\nis not bound by the rules but is a law unto himself. There are a lot of spiritual sociopaths, but we cannot\nbe one and survive spiritually. That is why the next counsel is:\nDeviate not from the path of good. \u201cThe good\u201d is learned by studying the scriptures and associating\nwith the good\u2013the godly. As Davey Crockett said: \u201cBe sure you\u2019re right, then go ahead.\u201d\nRevere greatness. Only those who can give respect\u2013even reverence\u2013are worthy of respect; only those\nwho bow can rise. Those who cannot see greatness in others have no greatness in themselves. As the\nsaying goes: \u201cMediocrity recognizes nothing above itself.\u201d The capacity to perceive, value, and honor\nvirtue, wisdom and holiness in another person is an essential ingredient in spiritual life. This is why\nthose religions that open the way to liberation have great veneration for saint and Masters, in contrast to\nthe \u201cbow down and worship me\u201d religions that can only guarantee earthly rebirth whatever their claims\nand promises may be. (The more they boast, the less they have.) The lives, teachings, and images of\nholy beings should fill our homes, keeping us aware that the ideals of spiritual life are attainable for us,\ntoo.\nA lesson on respect\n\u201cLet your mother be a god to you; let your father be a god to you; let your teacher be a god to you; let\nyour guest also be a god to you. Do only such actions as are blameless. Always show reverence to the\ngreat.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 1:11:2) The last two sentences have really been just covered, so we will\nlook at the earlier ones.\nFirst, the word translated \u201cgod\u201d is deva. Here is the definition given in A Brief Sanskrit Glossary:\n\u201cDeva: \u2018A shining one,\u2019 a god\u2013greater or lesser in the evolutionary hierarchy; a semi-divine or celestial\nbeing with great powers, and therefore a \u2018god.\u2019 Sometimes called a demi-god. Devas are the demigods\npresiding over various powers of material and psychic nature.\u201d As you see, deva in no ways means\nGod\u2013Ishwara, Bhagavan, or Brahman. It is indefensible to cite this verse in an attempt to coerce\ninnocent people into worshipping some guru as God.\nThe meaning is as clear as it is simple. We should revere our mother, father, teacher (acharya), and even\nour guests as citizens of higher worlds. We need not be blind to their defects, for the gods have defects,\nalso\u2013otherwise they would be free souls and not gods at all. We should do our best to accommodate\nthese earthly gods and to care for them with all love and solicitude. Here, too, exaggeration is not\nintended. If our parents tell us to commit wrong or damage or neglect our spiritual life we should\nignore it, but as much as is sensible we should defer to them in a reasonable manner. This is dharma.\n\nThere are many who \u201cdo good\u201d grudgingly as though taking bitter medicine, or with a kind of weary\n\u201cafter all it\u2019s my duty\u201d attitude. Many treat the objects of their \u201ccare\u201d or charity in a rude and\ncontemptuous manner or adopt the attitude of an exasperated adult toward a worrisome or recalcitrant\nchild. This is not dharma. So the upanishad continues: \u201cWhatever you give to others, give with love\nand respect. Gifts must be given in abundance, with joy, humility, and compassion.\u201d (Taittiriya\nUpanishad 1:11:3) This is a high ideal, but I have seen it done in both America and India by Christians,\nBuddhists, and Hindus. All it requires is a pure heart free from ego and selfishness. One time In\nVaranasi I saw two people feeding hundreds of poor people. At the end of the meal, each person was\ngiven money and clothing. As they left, they walked by the benefactors who saluted each one with\nfolded hands, saying \u201cThank you\u201d to each of them. They understood: by letting them give in charity,\nthose poor people were enabling them to create good karma for the future.\nA lesson on right conduct\nAnyone who has a developed conscience is concerned about accurately determining what right conduct\nreally is. So the upanishad tells us: \u201cIf at any time there is any doubt with regard to right conduct,\nfollow the practice of great souls, who are guileless, of good judgment, and devoted to truth. Thus\nconduct yourself always. This is the injunction, this is the teaching, and this is the command of the\nscriptures.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 1:11:4) Scriptures are important, but they are sometimes abstract,\nwhereas the lives of saints show us exactly how things should be done. If we can have access to a\nliving saint who will advise us, then we are most fortunate. But if not, we should seek out and read the\nlives of saints of all traditions and learn how to live. Often we may not at all care for the formal\ntheology of a particular saint\u2019s religious tradition, but his life transcends such things and shows how to\nlive in a divine manner. (Do not forget: many saints have been persecuted by their own religion\u2013even\nmartyred. So we need not accept the religion when we honor the saint.) \u201cGuileless, of good judgment,\nand devoted to truth\u201d\u2013such are the saints. And so should we be.\nThose who learn and follow these lessons given us in the upanishad shall be wise indeed.\n\nThe Source and the Goal\nBrahman\n\u201cHe who knows Brahman attains the supreme goal. Brahman is the abiding reality, he is pure\nknowledge, and he is infinity. He who knows that Brahman dwells within the lotus of the heart\nbecomes one with him and enjoys all blessings.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:1:1a)\nThis verse contains the famous formula: Satyam, jnanam, anantam Brahman\u2013\u201cBrahman is Reality,\nKnowledge, and Infinity.\u201d The rest of the verse is self-explanatory, except the Sanskrit says that the\nliberated one knows \u201cBrahman as existing in the intellect [buddhi] in the supreme space in the heart.\u201d\nThis is the seat of Om.\nFood\n\u201cOut of Brahman, who is the Self, came ether; out of ether, air; out of air, fire; out of fire, water;\nout of water, earth; out of earth, vegetation; out of vegetation, food; out of food, the body of\nman. The body of man, composed of the essence of food, is the physical sheath of the Self.\u201d\n(Taittiriya Upanishad 2:1:1b)\nThere are a few listings in the upanishads of the emanation-stages of creation, for it is essential to\nrealize that everything has come from Brahman and shall return to Brahman. Naturally they are broad\u2013\n\nvery broad\u2013outlines, for the manifestation of relativity has countless subtle stages. First there comes the\ngreat elements, forerunners of the elements here on the physical level. When the physical planets are\nfully formed, then vegetation appears, and then human beings as abodes of the Self. Implied here is the\nprinciple that vegetables are the natural and intended food of human beings\u2013certainly of those who\nintend to manifest the Self. The Gita and upanishads say a great deal about food because the mind is\nformed of the subtle essence of food. Vegetarian diet is a cornerstone of humanity, and a necessary\nfactor in the aspiration to divinity. No serious aspirant can afford to ignore this or attempt to. So the\nupanishad continues:\n\u201cFrom food are born all creatures, which live upon food and after death return to food. Food is\nthe chief of all things. It is therefore said to be medicine for all diseases of the body. Those who\nworship food as Brahman gain all material objects. From food are born all beings which, being\nborn, grow by food. All beings feed upon food, and, when they die, food feeds upon them.\u201d\n(Taittiriya Upanishad 2:2:1)\nThis is a great deal of mental food to digest, but is well worth the effort. Food (annam) is not just\nsomething material that an organism subsists on, but includes everything that goes to affect any sentient\nbeing. Thoughts and feelings are food, and all life-experiences are food. Intuitions are food. Of course\nsome are positive and some are negative, but they all go to \u201cfeed\u201d the evolving consciousness. But\nfrankly if we don\u2019t start with the regulation of physical food we need not bother with the metaphysical\nfood.\nFood, physical and subtle, is the medicine for all ills. This the Indian sages knew long before\nnutritionists or naturopaths existed. I was fortunate to know a truly great man, Dr. Josef Lenninger, who\ncould cure any disease with diet alone. He was never wrong and he never failed to cure anyone who\nfollowed his instructions. He even saved people\u2019s lives\u2013people that I knew. Diet is everything\u2013this I\nlearned from him much better than from any yogi.\nWhen we realize that Brahman is the ultimate \u201cfood\u201d then our spiritual health is assured. When we live\nin harmony with Brahman, all good comes to us on all levels of our existence. Just as bodies are\nabsorbed in the earth from which they and their food came, so finally we are absorbed into our original\nSource to \u201clife forever\u201d in the greatest sense.\nThe Bodies of the Bodiless\n\u201cDifferent from the physical sheath is the vital sheath. This is encased in the physical sheath and\nhas the same form. Through this the senses perform their office. From this men and beasts\nderive their life. This determines the length of life of all creatures. He who worships the vital\nsheath as Brahman lives to complete his span of life. This sheath is the living self of the\nphysical sheath.\n\u201cDifferent from the vital sheath is the mental sheath. This is encased in the vital sheath and has\nthe same form.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:3:1)\nJust as God has encased himself in various layers of manifestation, so has the Self. So knowledge of\nthese sheaths (koshas) is worthwhile.\nThe pranic and mental (manasic) bodies\nInside the physical body is the pranic body, the body of life-force. Without the pranic body the physical\nbody cannot live. The pranic body is also the most objective astral body, and when seen looks just like\n\nthe physical body. At death, the grossest part of the pranic body remains, which is why the hair and\nfingernails grow for a while after death. When it separates from the physical body at death, the pranic\nbody takes on the appearance it had when strongest\u2013usually as the person looked in early middle-age.\nWhen projected from the physical while the person still lives in embodiment, however, it looks just like\nthe physical body at that time.\nWithin the pranic body the currents of life-force move in subtle channels that correspond to the\nphysical nerves. In Sanskrit both the physical and pranic \u201cnerves\u201d are called nadis.\nThe pranic body draws its substance from food, sunlight, and air. This latter is one of the reasons yogis\npay attention to both diet and breathing. Health of the pranic body can produce health of the material\nbody. The pranic body does indeed determine both the health and the length of life of the physical\nbody. Prana is the very Life of God in manifestation, so we live in and by the Divine Life.\nIn a sense, the pranic body is the \u201cself\u201d of the physical. It is the link between the physical sense organs\nand the sensory mind, or manas, which is the mental sheath spoken of next. This body also has the form\nof the embodied person, but is more radiant than the pranic sheath. It, too, is astral, and draws a great\ndeal of its vitality from the pranic body.\nTheir limitation\nThese three bodies are mostly integrated with earthly experience\u2013that is their purpose. For this reason\nthey perceive only the slightest hints of spiritual being\u2013of Spirit Itself. Therefore the upanishad\ninterposes this statement:\n\u201cWords cannot express the bliss of Brahman, mind cannot reach it. The sage, who knows it, is\nfreed from fear.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:4:1)\nThis is tremendous information for the yogi. First, it tells him that any words about Brahman and\nBrahman-experience are worthless, even deceptive, since It cannot be spoken about, nor can the\nsensory mind perceive Brahman in Its pure Being. Next it tells him that those who know this truth will\nbe freed from great fear and doubts. This is because ignorant people continually mistake physical,\npranic, and mental phenomena for spiritual phenomena, Then, when the flaws\u2013and sometimes outright\nfalse character\u2013of those phenomena are discovered, the sincere seeker is thrown into doubt, fear, and\nconfusion. Disillusionment with these things sometimes cause the person to forsake spiritual life\naltogether. Of course, spiritual life is impossible on those levels, so they never really had one\u2013but they\naspired to do so. We are being warned by the upanishad to not make similar mistakes. The yogi must\ncontinually live higher than these three levels. He must realize that they are delusive to a high degree.\nNevertheless they are vehicles of the divine Self and must be cared for.\n\u201cThe mental sheath is the living self of the vital sheath.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:4:2)\nThe mental sheath draws much of its power from the pranic sheath, as I said, but it greatly controls the\npranic sheath and empowers it by directing it. For example, when the sensory mind sees attractive food,\nit stimulates the pranic sheath to begin the process of physical digestion. When it perceives something\npleasant the two other bodies are likewise affected, and when it perceives something fearful or lifethreatening its effects are sometimes cataclysmic.\nThe intellectual body\n\u201cDifferent from the mental sheath is the intellectual sheath. This is encased in the mental sheath\nand has the same form. All actions, sacrificial or otherwise, are performed through the intellect.\n\nAll the senses pay homage to the intellectual sheath. He who worships intellect as Brahman\ndoes not err; he does not identify himself with the other sheaths, and does not yield to the\npassions of the body.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:5:1)\nNow the upanishad speaks of the jnanamaya kosha, the intellectual sheath, that is also called the\nbuddhi, the intellect. This controls the three lower sheaths through intelligent understanding. Light\nstrikes the eye and imprints an image of a tree on the retina, the nerves, physical and pranic, convey\nimpulses to the physical and astral brains, the intellect perceives it and says: \u201cThat is a tree\u2013a maple\ntree.\u201d Without this function of the buddhi, we would not be human beings at all.\nThe intellectual sheath is not astral but causal. If we saw it, we would see light\u2013usually formless, but on\nthe lesser levels it could have the general outline of the human body. The senses are messengers to the\nintellect, its servants, actually. The wise yogi \u201cdoes not identify himself with the other sheaths,\u201d but\ncenters his awareness in and directs his life mostly from the buddhi. As a result he \u201cdoes not yield to\nthe passions of the body.\u201d Surely the buddhi is worthy of reverence.\nThe will body\n\u201cDifferent from the intellectual sheath is the sheath of the ego. This sheath is encased in the\nintellectual sheath and has the same form.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:5:2a)\nThe completion of the body complex is the highest body, the anandamaya kosha which is the seat of\nwill and the sense of asmita\u2013\u201cI exist.\u201d The intellect may know it is seeing a tree, but the will decides\nwhether or not to keep looking at it. In this way it fully controls the lesser levels. It both brings them\ninto function and stops their actions. Just as the buddhi makes us intelligent human beings, the willbody makes us effective human beings.\nThe anandamaya kosha is the subtlest causal level, so subtle that it \u201ctouches\u201d and partakes of the nature\nof the spirit-self. Functionally speaking, it is a mixture of subtle energy and pure consciousness\u2013though\nit is not really, since \u201cbeyond all sheaths is the Self.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:5:2b) Sometimes we have\nto speak inaccurately to get across at least a shadow of higher realities.\nKarma\nAll intelligent thought and action are possible because of the buddhi and the will. So they are really the\nseat of karma. That is why Buddha taught that intention determined the nature of karma more than the\nact, that a person who accidentally brought about the death of another would not be a murderer.\nSomeone who gives poison to an ill person, fully believing that it is medicine, is not guilty of taking\nlife. Ultimately karma is a matter of the will, for it is the basis of action.\nAll together\nThese five bodies correspond to the five elements: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. They also\ncorrespond to five levels of existence: bhuh, bhuvah, swah, maha, and jana lokas. According to which\nbody we mostly \u201clive\u201d in determines what world (loka) we will incarnate in after this life. Fortunately\nfor the yogi, he steps beyond these five bodies and cultivates awareness of the Self. So at death the\nskilled yogi goes to tapa loka, the world of those who are consciously evolving themselves. Hopefully\nhe will not return to earthly birth, but will continue on from there to the highest world, satya loka, the\nrealm of the liberated ones who know Brahman.\nBrahman and belief\n\nBeyond the sheaths is the Self, and beyond the Self as Its inmost being is Brahman. Brahman is the\nbasis of all and IS all, as the upanishad will soon discuss. This being so: \u201cVain and useless becomes his\nlife who thinks of Brahman as nonexistent. He alone who knows Brahman as existent truly lives.\u201d\n(Taittiriya Upanishad 2:6:1a) Interestingly, the upanishad literally says: \u201cIf anyone knows Brahman as\nnon-existent, he himself becomes non-existent.\u201d How many times do people \u201cknow\u201d something that is\ncompletely wrong. Our belief in God must not be based on our ignorant mind like the unbelief of the\natheist. I have known of people who became atheists when tragedy entered their lives, and I have\nknown people who became believers when tragedy came into their lives. Neither their unbelief nor\ntheir belief really amounted to anything. People who come to believe in God as a kind of last resort are\nlike conquered enemies, not free and loyal citizens of the kingdom of God.\nWe should not believe in God, we should know that God exists. There is a deep intuition of the\nexistence of God in each one of us that comes from our spirit-self. But because of the mental debris we\nhave accumulated in this and prior lives it has become greatly attenuated, distorted, or even obliterated.\nAn external factor can sometimes shift the debris pile to let some light through, but how long will it be\nbefore other things shift it back? The only really safe and sure way is to practice meditation and burn\nup the things that are obscuring our intuition of spirit. Then we will be knowers of the existence of\nBrahman and well on the way to becoming knowers of Brahman.\nOur minds possess the same creative power as the Divine Mind, though to a finite degree. Nonetheless,\nour mind determines our entire life\u2013the whole course of our evolution in this and all higher worlds. It\ndoes rest squarely on us. Remember what Sri Ramakrishna said: The mind is everything. God has\ncreated the playing field and supplied all the equipment for the game. But how we play is up to us\u2013\nnone else. If we do not know either the goal of the game or the way it is played, it is hopeless. As the\nupanishad says, the life of one who does not believe in God is vain and useless. But if we know the\ngoal, the rules, and the way to play, then we will play well\u2013truly live, as the upanishad says.\nThe only reason for the universe is the attainment of Brahmajnana. So the upanishad finally says:\n\u201cSurely at death a foolish man does not attain Brahman, but only a wise man.\u201d (Taittiriya\nUpanishad 2:6:1b)\n\nBrahman, Creation, and Us\nBrahman and creation\nNow we are ready for the subject of the creation and its implications for both God and human beings.\n\u201cDesiring that he should become many, that he should make of himself many forms, Brahman\nmeditated. Meditating, he created all things. Creating all things, he entered into everything.\nEntering into all things, he became that which has shape and that which is shapeless; he became\nthat which can be defined and that which cannot be defined; he became that which has support\nand that which has not support; he became that which is conscious and that which is not\nconscious; he became that which is gross and that which is subtle. He became all things\nwhatsoever: therefore the wise call him the Real.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:6:1c)\nDesiring that he should become many, that he should make of himself many forms, Brahman meditated.\nMeditating, he created all things. Certainly the One cannot become two, much less many. But he can\nexperience multiplicity through his omniscience. So he willed, and all things came into being through\n\nhis innate omnipotence. But it was totally an ideational process. The Cosmic Dreamer projected the\ncosmic dream. Then:\nCreating all things, he entered into everything. Entering into all things, he became\u2026all things\nwhatsoever: therefore the wise call him the Real. Pervading all things through his omnipresence he\nbecame aware of them and experienced \u201cbeing\u201d them just as in dream we take on many identities and\nforms that constantly change until we awaken. Brahman, in contrast, is always awake and knows what\n\u201cis\u201d and \u201cis not.\u201d There is nothing that Brahman has not become, described and indescribable, sentient\nand insentient. Brahman \u201cis\u201d all things.\nSwami Gambhirananda\u2019s more literal translation brings about a point to be noted. \u201cHe wished, \u2018Let me\nbe many, let me be born.\u2019\u201d The Birthless actually undergoes birth. And the same is true of us. We have\nneither birth nor death. Experience is not reality\u2013this we must learn.\n\u201cConcerning which truth it is written: Before creation came into existence, Brahman existed as\nthe Unmanifest. From the Unmanifest he created the manifest. From himself he brought forth\nhimself. Hence he is known as the Self-Existent.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:7:1a)\nGambhirananda\u2019s more literal translation gives us a better idea: \u201cIn the beginning all this was but the\nunmanifested [Brahman]. From that emerged the manifested. That Brahman created Itself by Itself.\nTherefore It is called the self-creator\u201d There is really no need for comment.\nAnd us\n\u201cThe Self-Existent is the essence of all felicity. Who could live, who could breathe, if that\nblissful Self dwelt not within the lotus of the heart? He it is that gives joy.\u201d (Taittiriya\nUpanishad 2:7:1b)\nGambhirananda: \u201cThat which is known as the self-creator is verily the source of joy; for one becomes\nhappy by coming in contact with that source of joy. Who, indeed, will inhale, and who will exhale, if\nthis Bliss be not there in the supreme space [within the heart]. This one, indeed enlivens.\u201d\nOne becomes happy by coming in contact with that source of joy. Brahman is of the nature of bliss\nitself, the source of joy to all beings. It is clear and simple: by coming in contact with that source of joy\nwe will be joyful. A lot of people are hyper and hysterical, and some are so heedless and unaware that\nthey are \u201chappy\u201d like village idiots. But only those who consciously contact Brahman through\nmeditation are truly happy and have inner joy\u2013the only kind that is real and lasting. Seeking happiness\nin anything but God can only lead to unhappiness. How many \u201cdeliriously happy\u201d people have we seen\nending up in what John Bunyan calls The Slough of Despond in Pilgrim\u2019s Progress? Their false joy\nevaporates so very quickly. Then they go running after another mirage. And another. And another.\nWho, indeed, will inhale, and who will exhale, if this Bliss be not there in the supreme space [within the\nheart]. This part is of utmost importance to yogis, for it indicates that the breath arises from the\nChidakasha, the principle (tattwa) of Conscious Ether, the abode of the Self. This is why all liberating\nyoga involves breath. For if breath arises from the Source, it will take us to that Supreme Bliss if we\nunderstand how to work with it. (See the chapter Breath and Sound in Meditation in Om Yoga.)\nKnowing Brahman\nThis one, indeed enlivens. This is why just a few verses back the upanishad says: \u201cVain and useless\nbecomes his life who thinks of Brahman as nonexistent. He alone who knows Brahman as existent truly\nlives.\u201d This is bedrock truth. That is why yoga is the Path to Life. The persevering yogi experiences\n\never-increasing life on all levels of his being. \u201cThe path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth\nmore and more unto the perfect day.\u201d (Proverbs 4:18)\n\u201cWhen a man finds his existence and unity in the Self\u2013who is the basis of life, who is beyond the\nsenses, who is formless, inexpressible, beyond all predicates\u2013then alone does he transcend fear. So long\nas there is the least idea of separation from him, there is fear. To the man who thinks himself learned,\nyet knows not himself as Brahman, Brahman, who drives away all fear, appears as fear itself.\u201d\n(Taittiriya Upanishad 2:7:1c)\nWe reach fearlessness when we know our unity with the Self and Brahman. To attain this fearlessness\nour consciousness must become more and more centered in That which is \u201cformless, inexpressible,\nbeyond all predicates.\u201d While living in this world we must inwardly dwell in the Transcendent Reality\nthat is Brahman, that is our Self. For \u201cso long as there is the least idea of separation from him, there is\nfear\u201d\u2013and with good cause. The life separated from God is no life at all, but a mirage of suffering,\nchange, decay, and death.\nPerhaps one of the saddest truths in any of the upanishads is this: \u201cTo the man who thinks himself\nlearned, yet knows not himself as Brahman, Brahman, who drives away all fear, appears as fear itself.\u201d\nWe see this all the time. Intelligent people fear the idea of living in the state of unity with God lest they\nlose their \u201cindividuality.\u201d They cling to death and call it life while avoiding life as though it were death.\nHow will they get out of that state? Only by a lot of buffeting by what they call life. It is not God who\npunishes and forsakes us because of this wrong choice\u2013it is the false world that does so from life to life.\nYet we grasp in desperation for more of its fake appearances and run from our only Life. In my early\nteens I spoke with a friend about how wonderful it was to free oneself of \u201cthe good things of life\u201d and\nturn to the Only Life. \u201cOh!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cif I lived like that I would feel like I was in prison!\u201d So he\nchose what the world told him was \u201creal living,\u201d and now he is a broken, miserable old man with\nnothing but alcoholism and sexual deviance as his companions. He chose imprisonment, and will no\ndoubt do so in future lives, for enslavement becomes a habit hard to break.\n\u201cConcerning which truth it is written: Through fear of Brahman the wind blows and the sun shines;\nthrough fear of him Indra, the god of rain, Agni, the god of fire, and Yama, the god of death, perform\ntheir tasks.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:8:1) The entire cosmos and all the processes of personal life take\nplace through cognition of God and his purpose. The \u201cfear\u201d spoken of here is awe which cancels out\nany possibility of defiance or disobedience. In the human being there should be a clear understanding\nthat since God is All, life should be lived accordingly. Along with that should be the realization that\nGod is our Self, that we are \u201cobeying\u201d our own nature in which is all joy, but outside of which there\ncan be nothing but fear.\nMeasuring the joy\nIn the seventh verse this question was set forth: \u201cWho could live, who could breathe, if that blissful\nSelf dwelt not within the lotus of the heart? He it is that gives joy. Now the upanishad takes up that\nsubject of the joy of the Self.\n\u201cOf what nature is this joy?\n\u201cConsider the lot of a young man, noble, well-read, intelligent, strong, healthy, with all the\nwealth of the world at his command. Assume that he is happy, and measure his joy as one unit.\n\u201cOne hundred times that joy is one unit of the joy of Gandharvas: but no less joy than\nGandharvas has the seer to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is without craving.\n\n\u201cOne hundred times the joy of Gandharvas is one unit of the joy of celestial Gandharvas: but no\nless joy than celestial Gandharvas has the sage to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is\nwithout craving.\n\u201cOne hundred times the joy of celestial Gandharvas is one unit of the joy of the Pitris in their\nparadise: but no less joy than the Pitris in their paradise has the sage to whom the Self has been\nrevealed, and who is without craving.\n\u201cOne hundred times the joy of the Pitris in their paradise is one unit of the joy of the Devas: but\nno less joy than the Devas has the sage to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is without\ncraving.\n\u201cOne hundred times the joy of the Devas is one unit of the joy of the karma Devas: but no less\njoy than the karma Devas has the sage to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is without\ncraving.\n\u201cOne hundred times the joy of the karma Devas is one unit of the joy of the ruling Devas: but\nno less joy than the ruling Devas has the sage to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is\nwithout craving.\n\u201cOne hundred times the joy of the ruling Devas is one unit of the joy of Indra: but no less joy\nthan Indra has the sage to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is without craving.\n\u201cOne hundred times the joy of Indra is one unit of the joy of Brihaspati: but no less joy than\nBrihaspati has the sage to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is without craving.\n\u201cOne hundred times the joy of Brihaspati is one unit of the joy of Prajapati: but no less joy than\nPrajapati has the sage to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is without craving.\n\u201cOne hundred times the joy of Prajapati is one unit of the joy of Brahma: but no less joy than\nBrahma has the seer to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is without craving.\u201d\n(Taittiriya Upanishad 2:8:2-4)\nJoy comes from knowing the Self and becoming free of all desire through the fulfillment that comes\nfrom union with Brahman.\nRising into joy\n\u201cHe who is the Self in man, and he who is the Self in the sun, are one. Verily, he who knows\nthis truth overcomes the world; he transcends the physical sheath, he transcends the vital sheath,\nhe transcends the mental sheath, he transcends the intellectual sheath, he transcends the sheath\nof the ego.\u201d (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:8:5)\nThis is the real Ascension, and only those who have done so are Ascended Masters. Just as God is\nuntouched by all the worlds that have proceeded from him, in the same way the liberated yogi cannot\nbe affected by his various sheaths (koshas), his own private \u201cworlds.\u201d\nIt is written: He who knows the joy of Brahman, which words cannot express and the mind\ncannot reach, is free from fear. He is not distressed by the thought, \u201cWhy did I not do what is\nright? Why did I do what is wrong?\u201d He who knows the joy of Brahman, knowing both good\nand evil, transcends both. (Taittiriya Upanishad 2:9:1)\nHe who knows Brahman is freed from all karmic bonds and knows that what he did and did not do will\n\nno longer affect him either in the present or the future. Having transcended both good and bad karma,\nhe is free. Sri Ramakrishna described such a person as being like a fish that had been caught in the net\nbut has jumped out into freedom and swims joyfully away.\n\nThe Ladder of Understanding\nLife is change; nothing ever stands still. When you do find something that is without any kind of\nchange, then that thing is dead\u2013including a lot of religion. A worthy spiritual aspirant is steady and\nunwavering in his aspiration and his endeavor, but he is always changing, for he is ever learning. He\ncontinually sees things either differently or better than before. To show us this, the upanishad is giving\nthe account of Bhrigu\u2019s search for knowledge of Brahman. In the Gita (10:25) Krishna says: \u201cAmong\nthe great sages I am Bhrigu,\u201d so this is a very important teaching that is being given us.\nKnow Brahman\u2026\n\u201cBhrigu, respectfully approaching his father Varuna, said: \u2018Sir, teach me Brahman.\u2019 Varuna\nexplained to him the physical sheath and the vital sheath and the functions of the senses, and\nadded: \u2018He from whom all beings are born, in whom they live, being born, and to whom at\ndeath they return\u2014seek to know him. He is Brahman.\u2019\u201d (Taittiriya 3.1.1)\nIt is absolutely necessary to \u201cknow the territory\u201d in any endeavor, whatever its kind. If equipment is\ninvolved, we must know and understand it thoroughly. This is why Oriental religions are so intent on\nthe makeup of the human being. First we have to be a conscious human before we can move on to the\nnext level of evolution. Therefore Varuna taught Bhrigu about the gross and subtle bodies, pointing out\nto him that all these have proceeded from Brahman\u2013are reflections of Brahman\u2013and that dealing with\nthem is dealing with Brahman in manifestation. Brahman is the totality of all being.\nGambhirananda gives a better version of the latter part of this verse: \u201cCrave to know that from which\nall these beings take birth, that by which the live after being born, that towards which they move and\ninto which they merge. That is Brahman.\u201d The first point is that we should not just seek to know\nBrahman, we must crave to know It\u2013there must be an intense hunger, a sense of absolute necessity, a\nlife-and-death attitude behind us. For that is the fuel that propels us onward to realization. At the same\ntime, we are not going against the current, but cooperating with the Eternal Flow, for all beings move\ntoward Brahman through the many stages of evolution, and eventually merge into Brahman. This is the\nonly natural mode of life, the only way of life which puts an end to all suffering and brings supreme\nfulfillment.\nTapasya\n\u201cBhrigu practiced austerity and meditation. Then it seemed to him that food was Brahman. For\nof food all beings are born, by food they are sustained, being born, and into food they enter after\ndeath. This knowledge, however, did not satisfy him. He again approached his father Varuna\nand said: \u201cSir, teach me Brahman.\u201d Varuna replied: \u2018Seek to know Brahman by meditation.\nMeditation is Brahman.\u2019\u201d (Taittiriya 3.2.1)\nBhrigu was highly intelligent, so his concept of \u201cfood\u201d was not just what humans eat to stay alive.\nRather, as in the teachings of the Prashna Upanishad, \u201cfood\u201d is emblematic of anything that sustains or\nis assimilated to the evolving organism and the inner consciousness. But even that did not satisfy him,\nfor it was too \u201chere and now\u201d while Reality is mostly transcendent. Varuna opened new vistas for him\nby saying that Tapasya is Brahman. In A Brief Sanskrit Glossary we find this definition: \u201cTapasya:\nAusterity, practical (i.e., result-producing) spiritual discipline; spiritual force. Literally it means the\n\ngeneration of heat or energy, but is always used in a symbolic manner, referring to spiritual practice and\nits effect, especially the roasting of karmic seeds, the burning up of karma.\u201d Who else but Brahman can\nincinerate the seeds of karma? Although tapasya includes specific methods of spiritual practice,\nultimately it is the power of release, of transmutation into Perfect Being. So tapasya in the highest\nsense is the active power of Brahman that IS Brahman bringing about liberation (moksha). Tapasya is\nBrahman within us. This should be the yogi\u2019s constant perspective. But tapasya is the means, not the\nend, so the search continues. It is necessary to realize this, for some people meditate a bit, get a little\nexperience, and think they are enlightened and know the mysteries of the universe. But, like Bhrigu, we\nmust never be satisfied. Sri Ramakrishna told the following parable:\n\u201cOnce upon a time a wood-cutter went into a forest to cut wood. Suddenly he came upon a\nBrahmachari [a monk]. The Brahmachari told him, \u2018My good man, go forward.\u2019 The woodcutter upon returning home began to think, \u2018Why did the Brahmachari tell me to go forward?\u2019\n\u201cA few days passed. One day as he was sitting idly the words of the Brahmachari came to mind.\nThen he said to himself, \u2018Today I will go further forward.\u2019 Going into the forest and moving\ndeeper he discovered innumerable sandalwood trees. He felt happy and brought back cartloads\nof sandalwood. And selling them in the market he became a rich man.\n\u201cA few days passed and he remembered again that the Brahmachari had said, \u2018Go forward.\u2019 He\nreturned to the forest and advancing deeper discovered a silver mine near a river. He had not\neven dreamt of it. Then he only mined silver and selling it made heaps of money.\n\u201cA few more days passed. And one day he thought, \u2018The Brahmachari did not tell me to go up\nto the silver mine alone. He told me to go forward.\u2019 This time going across the river he\ndiscovered a gold mine. Then he thought, \u2018Ah! That\u2019s why the Brahmachari asked me to go\nforward.\u2019\n\u201cAgain a few days afterwards, he advanced further and saw heaps of diamonds and other gems.\nThen he became prosperous like the god of wealth himself.\n\u201cTherefore I say whatever you may do you will find better things if you go forward. Do not\nthink that you have achieved all that is there because you felt a little inspired. If you go still\nfurther you will find God.\u201d\nPrimal Energy\u2013Prana\n\u201cBhrigu practiced meditation and learned that primal energy is Brahman. For from primal\nenergy all beings are born, by primal energy they are sustained, being born, and into primal\nenergy they enter after death. But Bhrigu was still doubtful about his knowledge. So he\napproached his father again and said: \u2018Sir, teach me Brahman.\u2019 Varuna replied: \u2018Seek to know\nBrahman by meditation. Meditation is Brahman.\u2019\u201d (Taittiriya 3.3.1)\nThe word here translated \u201cprimal energy\u201d is really Prana. Prana as used in this verse means the\nVishwaprana, the universal life force that makes all things live. It is energy, but that particular energy\nthat manifests as living things as well as the power of life itself.\nMind\n\u201cBhrigu practiced meditation and learned that mind is Brahman. For from mind all beings are\nborn, by mind they are sustained, being born, and into mind they enter after death. Still\ndoubtful, he approached his father and said: \u2018Sir, teach me Brahman.\u2019 His father replied: \u2018Seek\n\nto know Brahman by meditation. Meditation is Brahman.\u2019\u201d (Taittiriya 3.4.1)\nThe word translated \u201cmind\u201d is manas(a), which means the mind of the senses, that which perceives the\nmessage of the senses. It is like the screen on which images are projected. For this reason it is very easy\nto confuse the mind with consciousness\u2013indeed with the Self. But that is not so.\nIntellect\n\u201cBhrigu practiced meditation and learned that intellect is Brahman. For from intellect all beings\nare born, by intellect they are sustained, being born, and into intellect they enter after death. Not\nyet satisfied, doubting his understanding, Bhrigu approached his father and said: \u2018Sir, teach me\nBrahman.\u2019 Varuna replied: \u2018Seek to know Brahman by meditation. Meditation is Brahman.\u2019\u201d\n(Taittiriya 3.5.1)\nThe word translated \u201cintellect\u201d is vijnana. This is one of those instances in which the Sanskrit has more\nthan one meaning, and they are all intended. First, vijnana means the buddhi, the intellect, which is\nsuperior to the manas, the merely sensory mind. The buddhi is the intelligent, thinking mind, the\nfaculty that hopefully marks humans out from lesser evolved life-forms. Since the cosmos is\nIntelligence, it is easy to equate the buddhi with that; but it is not so. The other meaning of vijnana is\nsupreme knowledge, supreme wisdom, and supreme realization: the knowing that transcends mere\nintellectual knowing. It is the direct intuitive knowing of the spirit. This is so exalted that no one can be\nfaulted for assuming it is the highest. But it is not, so:\nJoy\n\u201cBhrigu practiced meditation and learned that joy is Brahman. For from joy all beings are born,\nby joy they are sustained, being born, and into joy they enter after death. This is the wisdom\nwhich Bhrigu, taught by Varuna, attained within his heart. He who attains this wisdom wins\nglory, grows rich, enjoys health and fame.\u201d (Taittiriya 3.6.1)\nAnanda is the word translated here as \u201cjoy.\u201d Ananda means bliss, supreme happiness, joy, and delight.\nIt is a very dynamic experience, for Brahman is defined as bliss (ananda). So to experience this\nsupreme bliss (Paramananda) is to be united with Brahman, for Brahman is that bliss.\nSome reflections\nThis account of Bhrigu\u2019s ascent to Brahman-knowledge has some very instructive points. First, no one\nneeded to tell Bhrigu that he had not really found Brahman\u2013his meditation-produced intuition told him\nthat. So he was not deluded by any experience he had; rather, the experience led him onward of itself.\nOf course, all along he was intuiting Brahman, but only partially, and he knew that. And he knew when\nhe finally had attained to complete realization, Purnananda, the Perfect (Total) Bliss. Equally important\nis the fact that Varuna never comments on Bhrigu\u2019s experience or conclusions, but just keeps telling\nhim to engage in tapasya. This is the way of the true Masters. They do not waste the aspirants\u2019 time\nwith hours and hours of theoretical philosophy, but urge them to find out the truth for themselves\nthrough the practice of yoga. This is the glory of yoga: it will reveal everything in time. It must also not\nbe overlooked that perfection in yoga brings about abundance in this world as well. Many are the yogis\nwho live simply and frugally, but that is their choice\u2013the treasurehouse of the world is open to them.\nFinal teachings\nSwami Prabhavananda skips some verses that are little more than a tedious recap of the \u201cfood\u201d part that\nhas gone before and comes directly to the meaningful verses at the very end:\n\n\u201cBrahman is to be meditated upon as the source of all thought and life and action.\u201d (Taittiriya\n3.10.2)\nWe must know that Brahman is ALL. \u201cHe is the splendor in wealth, he is the light in the stars. He is all\nthings.\n\u201cLet a man meditate upon Brahman as support, and he will be supported. Let him meditate upon\nBrahman as greatness, and he will be great. Let him meditate upon Brahman as mind, and he\nwill be endowed with intellectual power. Let him meditate upon Brahman as adoration, and he\nwill be adored. Let him worship Brahman as Brahman, and he will become Brahman. He who is\nthe Self in man, and he who is the Self in the sun, are one.\u201d (Taittiriya 3.10.3. 4)\nTo know Brahman is to know our Self as well, enabling us to exclaim:\n\u201cI am that Self! I am life immortal! I overcome the world\u2014I who am endowed with golden\neffulgence! Those who know me achieve Reality.\u201d (Taittiriya 3.10.6)\nAnyone who knows who a realized person is knows himself also. This is the true value of meeting\nthose who are liberated\u2013it furthers our own liberation.\nEnd of Taittiriya Commentary",
    "Aitareya": "\n\nAitareya Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Gambhirananda\nPublished by Advaita Ashram, Kolkatta\nOm ! May my speech be based on (i.e. accord with) the mind;\nMay my mind be based on speech.\nO Self-effulgent One, reveal Thyself to me.\nMay you both (speech and mind) be the carriers of the Veda to me.\nMay not all that I have heard depart from me.\nI shall join together (i.e. obliterate the difference of) day\nAnd night through this study.\nI shall utter what is verbally true;\nI shall utter what is mentally true.\nMay that (Brahman) protect me;\nMay That protect the speaker (i.e. the teacher), may That protect me;\nMay that protect the speaker \u2013 may That protect the speaker.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nI-i-1: In the beginning this was but the absolute Self alone. There was nothing else whatsoever that\nwinked. He thought, \u201cLet Me create the worlds.\u201d\nI-i-2: He created these world, viz. ambhas, marici, mara, apah. That which is beyond heaven is ambhas.\nHeaven is its support. The sky is marici. The earth is mara. The worlds that are below are the apah.\nI-i-3: He thought, \u201cThese then are the worlds. Let Me create the protectors of the worlds.\u201d Having\ngathered up a (lump of the) human form from the water itself, He gave shape to it.\nI-i-4: He deliberated with regard to Him (i.e. Virat of the human form). As He (i.e. Virat) was being\ndeliberated on, His (i.e. Virat'\u2019) mouth parted, just as an egg does. From the mouth emerged speech;\nfrom speech came Fire. The nostrils parted; from the nostrils came out the sense of smell; from the\nsense of smell came Vayu (Air). The two eyes parted; from the eyes emerged the sense of sight; from\nthe sense of sight came the Sun. The two ears parted; from the ears came the sense of hearing; from the\nsense of hearing came the Directions. The skin emerged; from the skin came out hair (i.e. the sense of\ntouch associated with hair); from the sense of touch came the Herbs and Trees. The heart took shape;\n\nfrom the heart issued the internal organ (mind); from the internal organ came the Moon. The navel\nparted; from the navel came out the organ of ejection; from the organ of ejection issued Death. The seat\nof the procreative organ parted; from that came the procreative organ; from the procreative organ came\nout Water.\nI-ii-1: These deities, that had been created, fell into this vast ocean. He subjected Him (i.e. Virat) to\nhunger and thirst. They said to Him (i.e. to the Creator), \u201cProvide an abode for us, staying where we\ncan eat food.\u201d\nI-ii-2: For them He (i.e. God) brought a cow. They said, \u201cThis one is not certainly adequate for us.\u201d For\nthem He brought a horse. They said, \u201cThis one is not certainly adequate for us.\u201d\nI-ii-3: For them He brought a man. They said \u201cThis one is well formed; man indeed is a creation of\nGod Himself\u201d. To them He said, \u201cEnter into your respective abodes\u201d.\nI-ii-4: Fire entered into the mouth taking the form of the organ of speech; Air entered into the nostrils\nassuming the form of the sense of smell; the Sun entered into the eyes as the sense of sight; the\nDirections entered into the ears by becoming the sense of hearing; the Herbs and Trees entered into the\nskin in the form of hair (i.e. the sense of touch); the Moon entered into the heart in the shape of the\nmind; Death entered into the navel in the form of Apana (i.e. the vital energy that presses down); Water\nentered into the limb of generation in the form of semen (i.e. the organ of procreation).\nI-ii-5: To Him Hunger and Thirst said, \u201cProvide for us (some abode).\u201d To them He said, \u201cI provide your\nlivelihood among these very gods; I make you share in their portions.\u201d Therefore when oblation is\ntaken up for any deity whichsoever, Hunger and Thirst become verily sharers with that deity.\nI-iii-1: He thought, \u201cThis, then, are the senses and the deities of the senses. Let Me create food for\nthem.\nI-iii-2: He deliberated with regard to the water. From the water, thus brooded over, evolved a form. The\nform that emerged was verily food.\nI-iii-3: This food, that was created, turned back and attempted to run away. He tried to take it up with\nspeech. He did not succeed in taking it up through speech. If He had succeeded in taking it up with the\nspeech, then one would have become contented merely by talking of food.\nI-iii-4: He tied to grasp that food with the sense of smell. He did not succeed in grasping it by smelling.\nIf He had succeeded in grasping it by smelling, then everyone should have become contented merely\nby smelling food.\nI-iii-5: He wanted to take up the food with the eye. He did not succeed in taking it up with the eye. If\nHe had taken it up with the eye, then one would have become satisfied by merely seeing food.\nI-iii-6: He wanted to take up the food with the ear. He did not succeed in taking it up with the ear. If He\nhad taken it up with the ear, then one would have become satisfied by merely by hearing of food.\nI-iii-7: He wanted to take it up with the sense of touch. He did not succeed in taking it up with the sense\nof touch. If He had taken it up with touch, then one would have become been satisfied merely by\ntouching food.\nI-iii-8: He wanted to take it up with the mind. He did not succeed in taking it up with the mind. If He\nhad taken it up with the mind, then one would have become satisfied by merely thinking of food.\nI-iii-9: He wanted to take it up with the procreative organ. He did not succeed in taking it up with the\nprocreative organ. If He had taken it up with the procreative organ, then one would have become\nsatisfied by merely ejecting food.\nI-iii-10: He wanted to take it up with Apana. He caught it. This is the devourer of food. That vital\nenergy which is well known as dependent of food for its subsistence is this vital energy (called Apana).\nI-iii-11: He thought, \u201cHow indeed can it be there without Me ?\u201d He thought, \u201cThrough which of the\ntwo ways should I enter ?\u201d He thought, \u201cIf utterance is done by the organ of speech, smelling by the\nsense of smell, seeing by the eye, hearing by the ear, feeling by the sense of touch, thinking by the\n\nmind, the act of drawing in (or pressing down) by Apana, ejecting by the procreative organ, then who\n(or what) am I ?\u201d\nI-iii-12: Having split up this very end, He entered through this door. This entrance is known as vidriti\n(the chief entrance). Hence it is delightful. Of Him there are three abodes \u2013 three (states of) dream. This\none is an abode, this one is an abode. This one is an abode.\nI-iii-13: Being born, He manifested all the beings; for did He speak of (or know) anything else ? He\nrealised this very Purusha as Brahman, the most pervasive, thus: \u201cI have realised this\u201d.\nI-iii-14: Therefore His name is Idandra. He is verily known as Idandra. Although He is Idandra, they\ncall Him indirectly Indra; for the gods are verily fond of indirect names, the gods are verily fond of\nindirect names.\nII-i-1: In man indeed is the soul first conceived. That which is the semen is extracted from all the limbs\nas their vigour. He holds that self of his in his own self. When he sheds it into his wife, then he\nprocreates it. That is its first birth.\nII-i-2: That becomes non-different from the wife, just as much as her own limb is. Therefore (the\nfoetus) does not hurt her. She nourishes this self of his that has entered here (in her womb).\nII-i-3: She, the nourisher, becomes fit to be nourished. The wife bears that embryo (before the birth).\nHe (the father) protects the son at the very start, soon after his birth. That he protects the son at the very\nbeginning, just after birth, thereby he protects his own self for the sake of the continuance of these\nworlds. For thus is the continuance of these worlds ensured. That is his second birth.\nII-i-4: This self of his (viz. the son) is substituted (by the father) for the performance of virtuous deeds.\nThen this other self of his (that is the father of the son), having got his duties ended and having\nadvanced in age, departs. As soon as he departs, he takes birth again. That is his (i.e. the son\u2019s) third\nbirth.\nII-i-5: This fact was stated by the seer (i.e. mantra): \u201cEven while lying in the womb, I came to know of\nthe birth of all the gods. A hundred iron citadels held me down. Then, like a hawk, I forced my way\nthrough by dint of knowledge of the Self\u201d. Vamadeva said this while still lying in the mother\u2019s womb.\nII-i-6: He who had known thus (had) become identified with the Supreme, and attained all desirable\nthings (even here); and having (then) ascended higher up after the destruction of the body, he became\nimmortal, in the world of the Self. He became immortal.\nIII-i-1: What is It that we worship as this Self ? Which of the two is the Self ? Is It that by which one\nsees, or that by which one hears, or that by which one smells odour, or that by which one utters speech,\nor that by which one tastes the sweet or the sour ?\nIII-i-2: It is this heart (intellect) and this mind that were stated earlier. It is sentience, rulership, secular\nknowledge, presence of mind, retentiveness, sense-perception, fortitude, thinking, genius, mental\nsuffering, memory, ascertainment resolution, life-activities, hankering, passion and such others. All\nthese verily are the names of Consciousness.\nIII-i-3: This One is (the inferior) Brahman; this is Indra, this is Prajapati; this is all these gods; and this\nis these five elements, viz. earth, air, space, water, fire; and this is all these (big creatures), together\nwith the small ones, that are the procreators of others and referable in pairs \u2013 to wit, those that are born\nof eggs, of wombs, of moisture of the earth, viz. horses, cattle, men, elephants, and all the creatures that\nthere are which move or fly and those which do not move. All these have Consciousness as the giver of\ntheir reality; all these are impelled by Consciousness; the universe has Consciousness as its eye and\nConsciousness is its end. Consciousness is Brahman.\nIII-i-4: Through this Self that is Consciousness, he ascended higher up from this world, and getting all\ndesires fulfilled in that heavenly world, he became immortal, he became immortal.\nOm ! May my speech be based on (i.e. accord with) the mind;\n\nMay my mind be based on speech.\nO Self-effulgent One, reveal Thyself to me.\nMay you both (speech and mind) be the carriers of the Veda to me.\nMay not all that I have heard depart from me.\nI shall join together (i.e. obliterate the difference of) day\nAnd night through this study.\nI shall utter what is verbally true;\nI shall utter what is mentally true.\nMay that (Brahman) protect me;\nMay That protect the speaker (i.e. the teacher), may That protect me;\nMay that protect the speaker \u2013 may That protect the speaker.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Aitareyopanishad, as contained in the Rig-Veda.\n\nAitereya Upanishad Commentary\nCommentary on the Aitereya Upanishad\u2013by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\nThe Worlds and the Self\nIn his translations of some upanishads Swami Prabhavananda omitted parts that were in such obscure\nlanguage that any attempt at translation would really only be speculation. He also omitted very\nrepetitious passages and those that dwelt with matters irrelevant to the knowledge of Brahman and the\nSelf. I think that if you get complete translations of those you will see he was quite justified in this.\nAnyhow, I am writing this to explain why in the references to the verses of this upanishad there will be\nsome jumping around.\nThe worlds\nBefore creation, all that existed was the Self, the Self alone. Nothing else was. Then the Self thought.\n\u201cLet me send forth the worlds.\u201d He sent forth these worlds: Ambhas, the highest world, above the sky\nand upheld by it; Marichi, the sky; Mara, the mortal world, the earth; and Apa, the world beneath the\nearth. (Aitareya Upanishad 1:1:1, 2)\nSeveral times in the upanishads we are told that when nothing else existed, Brahman \u201cwas;\u201d and from\nBrahman proceeded all the worlds. But in these opening verses of the Aitareya Upanishad the word\nAtman\u2013Self\u2013is used instead of Brahman. This is fitting for two reasons: First, because Brahman is the\nultimate Self of all. Second, because what occurred on the cosmic level in relation to Brahman has\n\noccurred on the microcosmic level with each one of us, with each individual Self that has entered into\nthe field of relative existence. Just as the various worlds or lokas have emanated from Brahman so the\nseveral bodies or koshas have emanated from the individual Self.\nThe upanishad lists four worlds that are also levels of existence. Ambhas is the highest world. It lies\nbeyond the material realm. Marichi is space itself in which many suns and planets are to be found. For\nthis reason, the upanishad uses the plural term Marichis, but it is correct to use the singular word since\nit means the entire cosmos. Mara is not just planet earth, but any planet on which sentient beings live.\nMara means death, and it is applied to the planets because all beings that live there are mortal. Apa is\nthe name of the submaterial regions from which atomic matter rises.\nThese worlds have a more metaphysical meaning as well. Ambhas is the causal world, Marichi is the\nastral world, Mara is the physical world, and Apa is the region where those of low evolution go for a\ntime after death\u2013usually in a kind of sleep. In later Indian cosmology the non-material worlds are\ndivided into those that are beneath the earth plane and those that are above the earth plane. The realms\nbeneath are the regions where animals and low-evolved humans go between incarnations. These worlds\ninclude the negative regions we call \u201chells.\u201d Apa embraces all these. The realms above are where\nnormal human beings go between lives, and include the world humans graduate into when they no\nlonger need evolution on the material place. These are the astral and causal worlds, Marichi and\nAmbhas.\nThe worlds have a psychological meaning, as well. Ambhas is the superconscious mind, Marichi is the\nhigher intelligence, or buddhi, Mara is the sensory, earth-centered mind or consciousness, and Apa is\nthe subconscious mind. These classifications particularly apply to the individual Self of each one of us.\nTheir guardians\n\u201cHe thought: \u2018Behold the worlds. Let me now send forth their guardians.\u2019 Then he sent forth their\nguardians.\u2026He thought: \u2018Behold these worlds and the guardians of these worlds. Let me send forth\nfood for the guardians.\u2019 Then he sent forth food for them.\u201d (Aitareya Upanishad 1:1:3, 1:3:1)\nThe word used here for guardians is lokapala. A lokapala is the ruler or custodian of a world (loka). At\nthe beginning of creation, each world was assigned an overseer or guardian. These are beings who have\nevolved to the status of \u201cgods\u201d and sometimes are mistaken for the Absolute by those within those\nworlds whose understanding is imperfect. Nevertheless, to approach them is beneficial, for they will\nthemselves reveal their limited nature and point questing souls to Brahman the Infinite. The lokapalas\nare like gardeners, for they work with living things and their development as well as their safety.\nActually, the picture of Adam in the Bible is very similar\u2013he was to supervise and foster all forms of\nlife, plant and animal. (Many ancient scriptures contain partial or garbled accounts that were once\nexpositions of wisdom. But the centuries have altered and even eroded them.)\nThe upanishad is speaking of the beginning of things. So immediately after the manifestation of the\nworlds, the lokapalas were awakened and made aware of their assignments; for their work is part of\ntheir personal evolutionary process. It is this work and the \u201cfurnishings\u201d of the worlds that are their\n\u201cfood.\u201d\nNow the same thing happens with us. We are the custodians of our private worlds or bodies. And our\nexperiences through those bodies and the development we gain are our food\u2013just as it is for the\nlokapalas.\nEntering the worlds\n\n\u201cHe thought: \u2018How shall there be guardians and I have no part in them? If, without me, speech is\nuttered, breath is drawn, eye sees, ear hears, skin feels, mind thinks, sex organs procreate, then what am\nI?\u2019 He thought: \u2018Let me enter the guardians.\u2019 Whereupon, opening the center of their skulls, he entered.\nThe door by which he entered is called the door of bliss.\u201d (Aitareya Upanishad 1:3:11, 12)\nThis narrative is more instructive than literally accurate. First of all, there is nothing that is not a\nmanifestation of Brahman. It is not possible for Brahman to enter into anything, for It is always\neverywhere. But the upanishad is teaching us as we teach children\u2013piecemeal and partially. The idea\nhere is that Brahman is enlivening and enabling all beings, from the lokapalas down to the least\nevolved of sentient beings.\nThese two verses are more individual than cosmic, however, and refer to us mostly. Our lokapalas are\nthe various faculties of the mind that administer the different levels of our being as humans. Brahman\nis, as I said, always present, but this verse speaks of the entry of the individual consciousness into the\nhuman complex when it incarnates as a human being. The Self enters through the psychic center or\nenergy whorl called the Brahmarandhra\u2013the aperture of Brahman\u2013and from there administers its\nprivate cosmos, a god within its finite universe.\nAccording to yogis, when we leave our body we go out through the gate (chakra) that corresponds to\nour dominant state of consciousness. Those who are depart through the Brahmarandhra. Others leave\nthrough the lower centers.\nWithin the three states of consciousness\n\u201cThe Self being unknown, all three states of the soul are but dreaming\u2013waking, dreaming, and\ndreamless sleep. In each of these dwells the Self: the eye is his dwelling place while we wake, the mind\nis his dwelling place while we dream, the lotus of the heart is his dwelling place while we sleep the\ndreamless sleep.\u201d (Aitareya Upanishad 1:3:12)\nThis is quite simple: If the Self is not known, then even our waking is only a sleeping and dreaming.\nThere is a lot of going around and around about the question of the reality of the world. But the\nupanishad gives us a quite simple answer: To those that sleep, not knowing the Self, the world is\nunreal; to those that are awake in the knowledge of the Self, the world is real\u2013for the world is the Self.\nThis is the frame of reference Buddha had when, meeting a Brahmin after his liberation, when the\nBrahman asked: \u201cWho are you?\u201d he replied: \u201cI am awake.\u201d\nTherefore: \u201cHaving entered into the guardians, he identified himself with them. He became many\nindividual beings. Now, therefore, if an individual awake from his threefold dream of waking,\ndreaming, and dreamless sleep, he sees no other than the Self. He sees the Self dwelling in the lotus of\nhis heart as Brahman, omnipresent, and he declares: \u2018I know Brahman!\u2019\u201d (Aitareya Upanishad 1:3:13)\nThis is both the beginning and the end.\nMore on the Self\nThe four closing verses of the upanishad need little comment. They begin:\n\u201cWho is this Self whom we desire to worship? Of what nature is this Self? Is he the self by which we\nsee form, hear sound, smell odor, speak words, and taste the sweet or the bitter? Is he the heart and the\nmind by which we perceive, command, discriminate, know, think, remember, will, feel, desire, breathe,\nlove, and perform other like acts? Nay, these are but adjuncts of the Self, who is pure consciousness.\u201d\n(Aitareya Upanishad 3:1:1, 2)\n\nThis is extremely important for us, since it is only natural that we would mistake these various faculties\nfor the Self, for they are functions of consciousness, though not Consciousness itself.\n\u201cAnd this Self, who is pure consciousness, is Brahman. He is God, all gods; the five elements\u2014earth,\nair, fire, water, ether; all beings, great or small, born of eggs, born from the womb, born from heat, born\nfrom soil; horses, cows, men, elephants, birds; everything that breathes, the beings that walk and the\nbeings that walk not. The reality behind all these is Brahman, who is pure consciousness.\u201d (Aitareya\nUpanishad 3:1:3)\nThis takes us a very necessary step further: Even those things that are not Brahman Itself in the purest\nsense, in another sense are Brahman and to be regarded as such. This is a bit like telling us to go two\nways at the same time, something impossible for the ordinary mind, but quite easy\u2013and natural\u2013for the\nyogi\u2019s mind.\nSwami Gambhirananda\u2019s rendering of the last part of this verse is very revealing: \u201cAll these have\nConsciousness as the giver of their reality; all these are impelled by Consciousness [Prajna]; the\nuniverse has Consciousness as its eye, and Consciousness is its end. Consciousness is Brahman.\u201d What\nsublime statements. Surely the upanishads are unparalleled in their beauty and profound teaching.\n\u201cAll these, while they live, and after they have ceased to live, exist in him. The sage Vamadeva, having\nrealized Brahman as pure consciousness, departed this life, ascended into heaven, obtained all his\ndesires, and achieved immortality.\u201d (Aitareya Upanishad 3:1:4) And so shall we.\nEnd of Aitareya Commentary",
    "Chandogya": "\n\nChandogya Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Swahananda\nPublished by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai\nOm ! Let my limbs and speech, Prana, eyes, ears, vitality\nAnd all the senses grow in strength.\nAll existence is the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nMay I never deny Brahman, nor Brahman deny me.\nLet there be no denial at all:\nLet there be no denial at least from me.\nMay the virtues that are proclaimed in the Upanishads be in me,\nWho am devoted to the Atman; may they reside in me.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nI-i-1: One should meditate on the syllable Om; the Udgitha, for one sings the Udgitha, beginning with\nOm. Of this, the explanation follows.\nI-i-2: The essence of all these beings is the earth. The essence of the earth is water. The essence of\nwater is vegetation. The essence of vegetation is man. The essence of man is speech. The essence of\nspeech is Rik. The essence of Rik is Saman. The essence of Saman is Udgitha.\nI-i-3: The syllable Om which is called Udgitha, is the quintessence of the essences, the supreme,\ndeserving of the highest place and the eighth.\nI-i-4: Which one is Rik ? Which one is Saman ? Which one is Udgitha ? This is being considered now.\nI-i-5: Speech alone is Rik. Prana is Saman. The syllable Om is Udgitha. Speech and Prana, (the sources\nof) Rik and Saman, taken together form a couple.\nI-i-6: This couple is joined together in the syllable Om. Whenever a couple come together, they, indeed,\nfulfil each other\u2019s desire.\nI-i-7: He who meditates upon this syllable as Udgitha knowing it thus (as the fulfiller), verily becomes\na fulfiller of all the desirable ends.\nI-i-8: That verily is the syllable of assent, for whenever one assents to a thing, one says only \u2018Om\u2019.\nAssent alone is prosperity. He who meditates upon this syllable as Udgitha, knowing it thus (as\nendowed with the quality of prosperity), verily becomes one who increases all the desirable ends.\nI-i-9: With this does the threefold knowledge proceed; (because) with Om does one cause to listen; with\n\nOm does one recite; with Om does one sing aloud. For the worship of this syllable, with its own\ngreatness and essence (the Vedic rites are performed).\nI-i-10: He who knows it thus and he who does not know \u2013 both perform actions with it. For knowledge\nand ignorance are different (in their results). Whatever is performed with knowledge, faith and\nmeditation becomes more effective. Up to this truly is the explanation of (the greatness of) this syllable\nOm.\nI-ii-1: Once upon a time the gods and the demons, both descendants of Prajapati, were engaged in a\nfight. In that fight, the gods performed the rites of the Udgatir priests resolving, \u2018With this we shall\ndefeat them\u2019.\nI-ii-2: Then they meditated on (the deity of) Prana connected with the nose, as Udgitha; the demons\npierced it with evil. Therefore with it, the nose, one smells both the fragrant and the foul, for it has been\npierced with evil.\nI-ii-3: Then they meditated on (the deity of) speech as Udgitha; the demons pierced it with evil.\nTherefore with it one speaks both truth and untruth, for it has been pierced with evil.\nI-ii-4: Then they meditated on (the deity of) eye as Udgitha; the demons pierced it with evil. Therefore\nwith the eye one sees both the sightly and the unsightly, for it has been pierced with evil.\nI-ii-5: Then they meditated on (the deity of) ear as Udgitha; the demons pierced it with evil. Therefore\nwith the ear one hears both the pleasant and the unpleasant, for it has been pierced with evil.\nI-ii-6: Then they meditated on (the deity of) mind as Udgitha; the demons pierced it with evil.\nTherefore with the mind one thinks both good and evil thoughts, for it has been pierced with evil.\nI-ii-7: Then they meditated on the Prana in the mouth as Udgitha. The demons came in clash with it and\nwere destroyed, just as a lump of clay is destroyed, striking against a hard rock.\nI-ii-8: Thus it is that the Prana in the mouth has not been destroyed and is pure. Even as a lump of clay\nstriking against a hard rock is destroyed, so will he be destroyed who wishes to do evil to one who\nknows this (the purity of Prana) or who (actually) injures that knower, for he is like a hard rock.\nI-ii-9: With this Prana in the mouth one discerns neither sweet smell nor foul, for it is free from sin.\nWhat one eats or drinks through this, even with that he maintains the other Pranas. And not finding this\nat the time of death, the Prana in the mouth and its dependants depart; and thus indeed one opens the\nmouth at the time of death.\nI-ii-10: Angiras meditated on that Prana as Udgitha. The sages consider this alone as Angirasa which is\nthe essence of the limbs.\nI-ii-11: So Brihaspati meditated on Prana as Udgitha. The sages consider this alone as Brihaspati, for\nspeech is great and this Prana is its lord.\nI-ii-12: So Ayasya meditated on Prana as Udgitha (identifying it with himself). The sages consider this\nalone as Ayasya for it goes out of the mouth.\nI-ii-13: Baka, the son of Dalbha, knew it thus. So he became the Udgatir-singer of the sacrificers\ndwelling in Naimisa. For their sake he sang to fulfil their desires.\nI-ii-14: He who knows it thus and meditates on the Udgitha as the syllable Om, looking upon it as\nPrana, certainly becomes the singer (and procurer) of the desired objects. This is the meditation with\nreference to the body.\nI-iii-1: Now the meditation (on the Udgitha) with reference to the gods is described. One should\nmeditate on him who gives heat (i.e. the sun) as Udgitha. Verily, when he rises, he sings aloud for the\nsake of all creatures. When he rises, he dispels darkness and fear. Verily, he who knows the sun as\nbeing endowed with these qualities, becomes the dispeller of darkness and (the consequent) fear.\nI-iii-2: This Prana in the mouth and that sun are the same. This is warm and that is warm. People call\nthis as Svara (that is going) and that as Svara and Pratyasvara (that is going and coming). Therefore one\nshould meditate on this Prana and that sun as Udgitha.\n\nI-iii-3: Now, verily one should meditate on Vyana as Udgitha. That which one breathes out is Prana and\nthat which one breathes in is Apana. The junction of Prana and Apana is Vyana. That which is Vyana,\neven that is speech. Therefore, one utters speech while one neither breathes out nor breathes in.\nI-iii-4: That which is speech, even that is Rik. Therefore while one neither breathes out nor breathes in,\none pronounces the Rik. That which is Rik, even that is Saman. Therefore, while one neither breathes\nout nor breathes in, one sings the Saman. That which is Saman, even that is Udgitha. Therefore, while\none neither breathes out nor breathes in, one sings the Udgitha.\nI-iii-5: Therefore whatever other actions require strength, such as the kindling of fire by friction,\nrunning a race towards a goal, the bending of a strong bow, are all performed, while one neither\nbreathes out nor breathes in. For this reason one should meditate on Vyana as Udgitha.\nI-iii-6: Now, one should meditate on the syllables of \u2018Udgitha\u2019 \u2013 namely, the syllables \u2018ut\u2019, \u2018gi\u2019 and\n\u2018tha\u2019. Prana is \u2018ut\u2019, because through Prana one arises (ut-tisthati). Speech is \u2018gi\u2019, because speech is\ncalled word (girah). Food is \u2018tha\u2019, because upon food all this is established (sthitam).\nI-iii-7: Heaven is ut, the sky is gi, the earth is tha. The sun is ut, the air gi, the fire, tha. The Sama-Veda\nis ut, the Yajur-Veda gi, the Rig-Veda tha. For him, speech yields the milk which is the benefit of\nspeech. And he becomes rich in food; and an eater of food, who knows thus and meditates on the\nsyllables of \u2018Udgitha\u2019, namely, ut, gi and tha.\nI-iii-8: Now follows the fulfilment of wishes: One should meditate on the objects contemplated. One\nshould reflect upon Saman by means of which one proceeds to sing the Stotra.\nI-iii-9: One should reflect upon the Rik in which that Saman occurs, upon the sage by whom it is\nintuited and upon the deity to whom he proceeds to pray.\nI-iii-10: One should reflect upon the metre in which he proceeds to sing a Stotra; and he should reflect\nupon the hymn with which he proceeds to sing it.\nI-iii-11: He should reflect upon the quarter (of heaven) towards which he proceeds to sing a Stotra.\nI-iii-12: Lastly, having thought about himself, he should sing a Stotra reflecting upon his desired object\navoiding all faults. Very quickly will be fulfilled for him the desire, desiring which he may sing the\nStotra yea, desiring which he may sing the Stotra.\nI-iv-1: One should meditate on the syllable Om, the Udgitha, for one sings the Udgitha beginning with\nOm. Of this the explanation follows.\nI-iv-2: Verily, the gods, being afraid of death, took refuge in the three Vedas. They covered themselves\nwith the metrical hymns. Because they covered themselves with these, the metrical hymns are called\nChandas.\nI-iv-3: Just as a fisherman would see a fish in water, so did Death observe the gods in the (rites\nconnected with) Rik, Saman and Yajus. They, too, knowing this, arose from the Rik, Saman and Yajus,\nand entered the Svara (the syllable Om).\nI-iv-4: Verily, when one learns the Rik, he loudly pronounces \u2018Om\u2019. It is the same with Saman and with\nYajus. This syllable Om is indeed Svara; it again is immortality and fearlessness. Having entered into\nSvara (i.e. having meditated) the gods became immortal and fearless.\nI-iv-5: He who worships this syllable knowing it thus, enters this syllable, the Svara, which is\nimmortality and fearlessness. And having entered it, he becomes immortal by that nectar, by which the\ngods became immortal.\nI-v-1: Now, that which is Udgitha is verily Pranava and that which is Pranava is Udgitha. The yonder\nsun is Udgitha and also Pranava, for he moves along pronouncing \u2018Om\u2019.\nI-v-2: \u2018To him (the sun itself) I sung; therefore you are my only son\u2019 thus said Kausitaki to his son.\n\u2018Reflect upon the Udgitha as the rays of the sun, then surely, you will have many sons. This is the\nmeditation with reference to the gods.\nI-v-3: Now (is the meditation) with reference to the body: One should meditate on him who is this\n\nPrana in the mouth, as Udgitha, for he moves along pronouncing \u2018Om\u2019.\nI-v-4: \u2018To him (the Prana itself) did I sing; therefore you are my only son\u2019, thus said Kausitaki to his\nson. \"I shall get many sons\", thinking thus, sing praise to the Udgitha as the manifold Pranas.\u2019\nI-v-5: \u2018Now, that which is Udgitha, is verily Pranava; and that which is Pranava, is Udgitha\u2019, so one\nshould think. As a result of it, even if he chants wrongly, he rectifies it by the act done from the seat of\nthe Hotr priest.\nI-vi-1: The earth is Rik, the fire is Saman. This Saman rests upon that Rik. Therefore the Saman is sung\nas resting upon the Rik. The earth is \u2018sa\u2019, the fire is \u2018ama\u2019, and that makes \u2018Sama\u2019.\nI-vi-2: The sky is Rik, the air is Sama. This Saman rests upon that Rik. Therefore the Saman is sung as\nresting upon the Rik. The sky is \u2018sa\u2019, the air is \u2018ama\u2019, and that makes \u2018Sama\u2019.\nI-vi-3: Heaven is Rik, the sun is Saman. This Saman rests upon that Rik. Therefore the Saman is sung\nas resting upon the Rik. Heaven is \u2018sa\u2019, the sun is \u2018ama\u2019, and that makes \u2018Sama\u2019.\nI-vi-4: The stars are Rik, the moon is Saman. This Saman rests upon that Rik. Therefore the Saman is\nsung as resting upon the Rik. The stars are \u2018sa\u2019, the moon is \u2018ama\u2019, and that makes \u2018Sama\u2019.\nI-vi-5: Now, the while light of the sun is Rik, the blue (light) that is extremely dark is Saman. This\nSaman rests upon that Rik. Therefore the Saman is sung as resting upon the Rik.\nI-vi-6: Again, the white light of the sun is \u2018sa\u2019, the blue (light) that is extremely dark is \u2018ama\u2019, and that\nmakes \u2018Sama\u2019. Now, that Person, effulgent as gold, who is seen within the sun, who is with golden\nbeard and golden hair, is exceedingly effulgent even to the very tips of his nails.\nI-vi-7: His eyes are bright like a red lotus. His name is \u2018ut\u2019. He has risen above all evils. Verily, he who\nknows thus rises above all evils.\nI-vi-8: Rik and Saman are his two joints. Therefore he is Udgitha. Because the priest is the singer of\nthis \u2018ut\u2019, he is the Udgitha. Moreover, he (this Person called \u2018ut\u2019) controls the worlds which are above\nthat sun, as also the desires of the gods. This is with reference to the gods.\nI-vii-1: Now (is the meditation) with reference to the body: Speech is Rik, Prana is Sama. This Saman\nrests upon that Rik. Therefore the Saman is sung as resting upon the Rik. Speech is \u2018sa\u2019, Prana is \u2018ama\u2019\nand that makes \u2018Sama\u2019.\nI-vii-2: The eye is Rik, the self (reflected in the eye) is Saman. This Saman rests upon that Rik.\nTherefore the Saman is sung as resting upon the Rik. The eye is \u2018sa\u2019, the self is \u2018ama\u2019, and that makes\n\u2018Sama\u2019.\nI-vii-3: The ear is Rik, the mind is Saman. This Saman rests upon that Rik. Therefore the Saman is sung\nas resting upon the Rik. The ear is \u2018sa\u2019, the mind is \u2018ama\u2019, and that makes \"Sama\u2019.\nI-vii-4: Now, the white light of the eye is Rik, the blue (light) that is extremely dark is Saman. This\nSaman rests upon that Rik. Therefore the Saman is sung as resting upon the Rik. The white light of the\neye is \u2018sa\u2019, the blue (light) that is extremely dark is \u2018ama\u2019 and that makes \u2018Sama\u2019.\nI-vii-5: Now, this person who is seen within the eye \u2013 he indeed is Rik, he is Saman, he is Uktha, he is\nYajus, he is the Vedas. The form of this (person seen in the eye) is the same as the form of that (person\nseen in the sun). His joints are the same as those of the other; his name is the same as that of the other.\nI-vii-6: That (person in the eye) is the lord of all the worlds that are extended below, as also of the\ndesired objects of men. So those who sing on the lute, sing of him alone and thereby become endowed\nwith wealth.\nI-vii-7: Now he who sings the Saman after knowing the deity Udgitha thus, sings to both. Through that\n(person in the sun), he (that singer) gets the worlds beyond that sun and also the desired objects of\ngods.\nI-vii-8-9: Similarly, through this person in the eye, one gets the worlds that are extended below this\nperson, and also the desired objects of men. For this reason, the Udgatir priest who knows thus should\nask (the sacrificer): \u2018What desire shall I obtain for you by singing the Saman ?\u2019 For he alone becomes\n\ncapable of obtaining desires by singing , who knowing thus sings the Saman \u2013 yea, sings the Saman.\nI-viii-1: In ancient times there were three proficient in Udgitha: Silaka the son of Salavat, Caikitayana\nof the Dalbhya family and Pravahana the son of Jivala. They said, \u2018We are proficient in Udgitha. If you\nagree, let us enter on a discussion of Udgitha\u2019.\nI-viii-2: \u2018Let it be so\u2019, saying this they sat down. Then Pravahana Jaivali said, \u2018You two, revered sirs,\nspeak first; and I shall listen to the words of two Brahmanas conversing\u2019.\nI-viii-3: Then Silaka Salavatya said to Caikitayana Dalbhya, \u2018If you permit, I shall question you\u2019.\n\u2018Question\u2019, said he.\nI-viii-4: (Silaka asked), \u2018What is the essence of Saman ?\u2019 \u2018The tune\u2019, said (Dalbhya). \u2018What is the\nessence of the tune ?\u2019 \u2018Prana\u2019, said (Dalbhya). \u2018What is the essence of Prana ?\u2019 \u2018Food\u2019, said (Dalbhya).\n\u2018What is the essence of food ?\u2019 \u2018Water\u2019, said (Dalbhya).\nI-viii-5: \u2018What is the essence of water ?\u2019 \u2018That (heavenly world)\u2019, said (Dalbhya). \u2018What is the essence\nof the world ?\u2019 \u2018One cannot carry (the Saman) beyond the heavenly world\u2019, said Dalbhya; \u2018we locate\nthe Saman in the world of heaven, for Saman is praised as heaven\u2019.\nI-viii-6: Then Silaka Salavatya said to Caikitayana Dalbhya: \u2018O Dalbhya, your Saman is not indeed\nestablished. If someone one were to say, \"Your head shall fall down\", surely your head would fall\ndown\u2019.\nI-viii-7: (Dalbhya) \u2018Will you permit me, sir, to learn this of you ?\u2019 \u2018Learn\u2019, said (Silaka). \u2018What is the\nessence of that (heavenly) world ?\u2019 \u2018This earth\u2019, said (Silaka), \u2018What is the essence of this earth ?\u2019 \u2018One\ncannot carry the Saman beyond this world as its support\u2019, said Silaka; \u2018we locate the Saman in this\nworld as its support, for Saman is extolled as the earth\u2019.\nI-viii-8: Pravahana Jaivali said to him, \u2018O Salavatya, your Sama, really, has a further end. If someone\nnow were to say, \"Your head shall fall down\", surely your head would fall down. (Salavatya) \u2018Will you\npermit me, sir, to learn (this of you ?) \u2018Learn\u2019, said (Jaivali).\nI-ix-1: (Salavatya) \u2018What is the essence of this world ?\u2019 \u2018Akasa\u2019 said (Pravahana); \u2018All these beings\narise from Akasa alone and are finally dissolved into Akasa; because Akasa alone is greater than all\nthese and Akasa is the support at all times.\u2019\nI-ix-2: It is this Udgitha which is progressively higher and better. This again is endless. He who,\nknowing thus, meditates upon the progressively higher and better Udgitha, obtains progressively higher\nand better lives and wins progressively higher and better worlds.\nI-ix-3: Atidhanvan, the son of Sunaka, having taught this to Udarasandilya, said, \u2018As long as among\nyour descendants, this knowledge of the Udgitha continues, so long their life in this world will be\nprogressively higher and better than ordinary lives.\u2019\nI-ix-4: \u2018And in that other world also their state will be similar\u2019. He who knows and meditates thus \u2013 his\nlife in this world surely becomes progressively higher and better, and so also his state in that other\nworld \u2013 yea, in that other world.\nI-x-1: When the crops in the Kuru country had been destroyed by hailstorms, there lived Usasti, the son\nof Cakra with his young wife in a deplorable condition in the village of elephant-drivers.\nI-x-2: He begged food of an elephant-driver, while he was eating beans of an inferior quality. The\ndriver said to him, \u2018There is no other food than what is set before me\u2019.\nI-x-3: \u2018Give me some of them\u2019, said Usasti. The driver gave them to him and said, \u2018Here is drink at\nhand, if you please 1\u2019 \u2018Then I shall be drinking what is defiled\u2019, said Usasti.\nI-x-4: \u2018Are not these beans also defiled ?\u2019 \u2018Unless I ate them, I would surely not have survived\u2019, said\nUsasti, \u2018but drinking is at my option\u2019.\nI-x-5: Usasti, after he had eaten, brought the remainder to his wife. She had already obtained her food\nby alms; so after receiving it she kept it by.\nI-x-6: Next morning while leaving the bed he said, \u2018Alas, if I could get a little of food, I could earn a\n\nlittle wealth. There a king is going to institute a sacrifice; he would appoint me to all the priestly\noffices\u2019.\nI-x-7: His wife said to him, \u2018Well, lord, here are the beans (given by you).\u2019 Having eaten them he went\noff to that sacrifice which was being performed.\nI-x-8: Seeing the singing priests seated there, he sat down near the singers in the place for singing the\nStotras. And then he addressed the Prastotir priest.\nI-x-9: \u2018O Prastotir, if you sing the Prastava without knowing the deity that belongs to the Prastava, your\nhead will fall down\u2019.\nI-x-10: In the same manner he addressed the Udgatir priest, O Udgatir, if you sing the Udgitha without\nknowing the deity that belongs to the Udgitha, your head will fall down\u2019.\nI-x-11: In the same manner he addressed the Pratihartir priest, \u2018O Pratihartir, if you sing the Pratihara\nwithout knowing the deity that belongs to the Pratihara, your head will fall down\u2019. Then they all sat\ndown silently suspending their duties.\nI-xi-1: Then the principal of the sacrifice said to him, I should like to know you, revered sir, \u2018I am\nChakrayana Usasti\u2019, said he.\nI-xi-2: He said, \u2018I searched for you, revered sir, for all these priestly offices, but not finding you, sir, I\nhave chosen others.\u2019\nI-xi-3: \u2018Revered sir, you yourself take up all the priestly offices for me\u2019. \u2018Be it so; then, let these same\npriests sing the hymns, being permitted by me. But you should give me as much wealth as you give\nthem.\u2019 \u2018Very well\u2019, said the sacrificer.\nI-xi-4: Then the Prastotir priest approached him and said, \u2018Revered sir, you said to me: \u2018O Prastotir, if\nyou sing the Prastava without knowing the deity that belongs to the Prastava, your head will fall down\".\nWhich is that deity ?\u2019\nI-xi-5: \u2018Prana\u2019, said Usasti, \u2018all these movable and immovable beings merge in Prana (during\ndissolution) and rise out of Prana (during creation). This is the deity that belongs to the Prastava. If you\nsang the Prastava without knowing him, after your having been warned thus by me, your head would\nhave fallen down.\u2019\nI-xi-6: Then the Udgatir priest approached him and said, \u2018Revered sir, you said to me: \u2018O Udgatir, if\nyou sing the Udgitha without knowing the deity that belongs to the Udgitha, your head will fall down\".\nWhich is that deity ?\u2019\nI-xi-7: \u2018The sun\u2019, said Usasti, \u2018all these movable and immovable sing the praise of the sun when he has\ncome up. This is the deity that belongs to the Udgitha. If you sang the Udgitha without knowing him,\nafter your having been warned thus by me, your head would have fallen down.\u2019\nI-xi-8: Then the Pratihartir priest approached him and said, \u2018Revered sir, you said to me: \u2018O Pratihartir,\nif you sing the Pratihara without knowing the deity that belongs to the Pratihara, your head will fall\ndown\". Which is that deity ?\u2019\nI-xi-9: \u2018Food\u2019, said Usasti, \u2018all these movable and immovable beings live by partaking of food only.\nThis is the deity that belongs to the Pratihara. If you sang the Pratihara without knowing him, after your\nhaving been warned thus by me, your head would have fallen down.\u2019\nI-xii-1: Therefore next begins the Udgitha seen by the dogs. Once Dalbhya Baka, called also Maitreya\nGlava, went out (of the village) for the study of the Vedas.\nI-xii-2: Before him a white dog appeared and other dogs gathered around it and said, \u2018Revered sir,\nplease obtain food for us by singing; we are hungry.\u2019\nI-xii-3: The white dog said to them, \u2018Come to me over here tomorrow morning.\u2019 (The sage named)\nDalbhya Baka and Maitreya Glava kept watch there for them.\nI-xii-4: Just as those who recite the Stotras singing the Bahispavamana hymn move along clasping one\nanother\u2019s hand, even so did the dogs move along. Then they sat down and began to pronounce \u2018him\u2019.\n\nI-xii-5: \u2018Om, let us eat ! Om, let us drink ! Om, may the (sun who is) god, Varuna, Prajapati and Savitir\nbring us food here. O Lord of food, bring food here, yea bring it, Om !\u2019\nI-xiii-1: Verily, this world is the syllable \u2018hau\u2019 (which is a Stobha), the air is the syllable \u2018hai\u2019, the moon\nis the syllable \u2018atha\u2019, the self is the syllable \u2018iha\u2019 and the fire is the syllable \u2018I\u2019.\nI-xiii-2: The sun is the syllable \u2018u\u2019 (which is a Stobha), invocation is the syllable \u2018e\u2019 the Visvadevas are\nthe syllable \u2018auhoyi\u2019, Prajapati is the syllable \u2018him\u2019, Prana is the Stobha \u2018svara\u2019, food is the Stobha \u2018ya\u2019\nand Virat is the Stobha \u2018vak\u2019.\nI-xiii-3: The undefinable and variable thirteenth Stobha is the syllable \u2018hum\u2019.\nI-xiii-4: For him, speech yields the milk, which is the benefit of speech; and he becomes richin food\nand an eater of food, who thus knows this sacred doctrine of the Samans \u2013 yea, knows the sacred\ndoctrine of the Samans.\nII-i-1: Om. Surely, the meditation on the whole Saman is good. Anything that is good, people call as\nSaman, anything that is not good, as Asaman.\nII-i-2: Thus, when people say, \u2018He approached him with Saman\u2019, then they say only this: \u2018He\napproached him with a good motive\u2019. And when they say, \u2018He approached him with Asaman\u2019, then they\nsay only this\" \u2018He approached him with an evil motive.\u2019\nII-i-3: Again, people say: \u2018Oh, this is Saman for us\u2019, when it is something good; then they say only this:\n\u2018Oh, this is good for us\u2019. Again, they say, \u2018Oh, this is Asaman for us\u2019, when it is not good; then they say\nonly this: \u2018Oh, this is evil.\u2019\nII-i-4: When one who knows it thus meditates on the Saman as good, all good qualities hasten towards\nhim and serve him.\nII-ii-1: Among the worlds one should meditate upon the Saman as fivefold. The earth is the syllable\nhim, the fire is Prasrava, the sky is Udgitha, the sun is Pratihara, and heaven is Nidhana. Thus this\nmeditation pertains to the higher worlds.\nII-ii-2: Now, among the lower worlds. Heaven is the syllable him, the sun is Prastava, the sky is\nUdgitha the fire is Pratihara, and the earth is Nidhana.\nII-ii-3: The worlds in the ascending and descending lines belong to him. Who, knowing it thus\n(endowed with the quality of \u2018good\u2019) meditates on the fivefold Saman in the worlds.\nII-iii-1-2: One should meditate on the fivefold Saman as rain. The wind that precedes is the syllable\nhim, the cloud that is formed is Prastava, the shower is Udgitha, lightning and thunder are Pratihara,\nand the ceasing is Nidhana. It rains for him \u2013 indeed, he causes rain \u2013 who, knowing it thus, meditates\non the fivefold Saman as rain.\nII-iv-1: One should meditate on the fivefold Saman in all the waters. When a cloud gathers, it is the\nsyllable him. When it rains, it is Prastava. Those (waters) that flow to the east, are Udgitha. Those that\nflow to the west are Pratihara. The ocean is Nidhana.\nII-iv-2: He who, knowing it thus, meditates on the fivefold Saman in all the waters, does not drown in\nwater and he becomes rich in water.\nII-v-1: One should meditate on the fivefold Saman as the seasons: The spring is the syllable him, the\nsummer is Prastava, the rainy season is Udgitha, the autumn is Pratihara, and the winter is Nidhana.\nII-v-2: He, who knowing it thus, meditates on the fivefold Saman in the seasons, him the seasons serve\nand he becomes rich in seasons.\nII-vi-1: One should meditate on the fivefold Saman as the animals. The goats are the syllable him, the\nsheep are Prastava, the cows are Udgitha, the horses are Pratihara, and man is Nidhana.\nII-vi-2: He, who knowing it this, meditates on the fivefold Saman in animals, to him animals belong\n\nand he becomes rich in animals.\nII-vii-1: One should meditate on the progressively higher and better fivefold Saman as the senses; The\norgan of smell is the syllable him, the organ of speech is Prastava, the eye is Udgitha, the ear is\nPratihara, and the mind is Nidhana. Verily, these are progressively higher and better.\nII-vii-2: He who knowing it thus, meditates on the fivefold Saman, progressively higher and better, in\nthe senses, to him belong progressively higher and better lives and he wins ever higher and better\nworlds. So much for (the meditation on) the fivefold Saman.\nII-viii-1-2: Next is the meditation on the sevenfold Saman. One should meditate on the sevenfold\nSaman as speech. Whatsoever in speech is \u2018hum\u2019, that is the syllable him; whatever is \u2018pra\u2019, that is\nPrastava; whatever is \u2018a\u2019, that is Adi (the first); whatever is \u2018ut\u2019, that is Udgitha; whatever is \u2018prati\u2019, that\nis Pratihara; whetever is \u2018upa\u2019, that is Upadrava; and whatever is \u2018ni\u2019, that is Nidhana.\nII-viii-3: He who knowing it thus, meditates on the sevenfold (whole) Saman as speech, for him speech\nyields milk i.e. its appropriate benefit, and he becomes rich in food and an eater of food.\nII-ix-1: Next, one should meditate upon the sevenfold Saman as the yonder sun. He is the Saman\nbecause he is always the same. He is the Saman because he is the same to all, for each one thinks, \u2018He\nfaces me, he faces me.\u2019\nII-ix-2: One should know that all these beings are dependent on him. What he is before rising, that is\nHimkara. On this, the animals are dependent. As they participate in the Himkara part of this Saman, do\nthey utter him (before sunrise).\nII-ix-3: Then, the form of the sun when it has just risen, that is Prastava. On this, men are dependent.\nAs they participate in the Prastava part of this Saman, so are they desirous of praise, direct and indirect.\nII-ix-4: And the form of the sun as it appears at the time of the assembling of its rays, that is Adi. On\nthis, the birds are dependent. As they participate in the Adi part of this Saman, so do they hold\nthemselves unsupported in the sky and fly about.\nII-ix-5: Next, the form of the sun that appears just at midday, that is Udgitha. On this, the gods are\ndependent. As they participate in the Udgitha part of this Saman, so are they the best among the\noffsprings of Prajapati.\nII-ix-6: Next, the form of the sun that appears just after midday and before (the latter part of) afternoon,\nthat is Pratihara. On this, the foetuses are dependent. As they participate in the Pratihara part of this\nSaman, (so are they held up in the womb) and they do not fall down.\nII-ix-7: Next, the form of the sun that appears when it is past afternoon and before sunset, that is\nUpadrava. On this, the wild animals are dependent. As they participate in the Upadrava part of this\nSaman, so do they, when they see a man, run away to the forest, as to a place of safety.\nII-ix-8: Now, the form of the sun that appears just after sunset, that is Nidhana. On this, the fathers are\ndependent. As they participate in the Nidhana part of this Saman, so do people lay them aside.\nII-x-1: Now, verily, one should meditate on the sevenfold Saman, which has all its parts similar, and\nwhich leads beyond death. \u2018Himkara, has three syllables; \u2018Prastava\u2019 has three syllables. So they are\nequal to each other.\nII-x-2: \u2018Adi\u2019 has two syllables; \u2018Pratihara\u2019 has four syllables. We take one syllable from Pratihara to\nAdi. So they are equal to each other.\nII-x-3: \u2018Udgitha\u2019 has three syllables; \u2018Upadrava\u2019 has four syllables. Three and three become equal. One\nsyllable is left over; that really is tri-syllabic; so it also becomes equal.\nII-x-4: \u2018Nidhana\u2019 has three syllables, and this to is equal (to the others). These, indeed, are the twenty\ntwo syllables (of the sevenfold Saman).\nII-x-5-6: He who, knowing this Saman thus (as good), meditates on the sevenfold Saman, which has all\nits parts similar and which leads beyond death, reaches the sun (Death) by the number twenty-one; for,\n\ncounting from this world the yonder sun is verily the twenty-first. With the remaining twenty-second\nsyllable he conquers the world beyond the sun. That world is of the nature of bliss, and is free from\nmisery. (That is), he obtains victory over the sun, and then a victory still higher becomes his, who\nmeditates on the sevenfold Saman.\nII-xi-1: The mind is Himkara, speech is Prastava, the eye is Udgitha, the ear is Pratihara, and the Prana\nis Nidhana. This is the Gayatra Saman woven in (the Prana and) the senses.\nII-xi-2: He who thus knows this Gayatra Saman as woven in (the Prana and) the senses, becomes the\npossessor of perfect senses, reaches the full length of life, lives gloriously, becomes great with\noffspring and cattle, and great also with fame. His holy vow is that he should be high-minded.\nII-xii-1: One rubs, that is Himkara. The smoke is produced, that is Prastava. It blazes, that is Udgitha.\nThe embers are formed, that is Pratihara. It goes down, that is Nidhana. It is completely extinguished,\nthat is Nidhana. This is the Rathantara Saman woven in fire.\nII-xii-2: He who thus knows this Rathantara Saman as woven in fire becomes radiant with the holy\neffulgence born of sacred wisdom, is endowed with good appetite and reaches the full length of life,\nlives gloriously, becomes great with offspring and cattle, and great also with fame. His holy vow is that\nhe should neither sip nor spit facing the fire.\nII-xiii-1-2: The Vamadevya Saman is woven in a couple. He who thus knows this Vamadevya Saman as\nwoven in a couple becomes one of the couple and procreates. He reaches the full length of life, lives\ngloriously, becomes great with offspring and cattle, and great also with fame. His holy vow is that he\nshould not despise any woman.\nII-xiv-1: The rising sun is Himkara; the risen sun is Prastava; the midday sun is Udgitha; the sun in the\nafternoon is Pratihara, and the setting sun is Nidhana. This is the Brihat Saman woven in the sun.\nII-xiv-2: He who thus knows this Brihat Saman as woven in the sun becomes refulgent and endowed\nwith good appetite, reaches the full length of life, lives gloriously, becomes great with offspring and\ncattle, and great also with fame. His holy vow is that he should not find fault with the burning sun.\nII-xv-1: The white clouds gather, that is Himkara. The (rain-bearing) cloud is formed, that is Prastava.\nIt rains, that is Udgitha. It flashes and thunders, that is Pratihara. It ceases, that is Nidhana. This is the\nVairupa Saman woven in the rain-cloud.\nII-xv-2: He who thus knows this Virupa Saman as woven in the rain-cloud acquires cattle of handsome\nand manifold forms, reaches the full length of life, lives gloriously, becomes great with offspring and\ncattle, and great also with fame. His holy vow is that he should not find fault with the rain-cloud when\nit rains.\nII-xvi-1: The spring is Himkara, the summer is Prastava, the rainy season is Udgitha, the autumn is\nPratihara, and the winter is Nidhana. This is the Vairaja Saman woven in the seasons.\nII-xvi-2: He who thus knows this Vairaja Saman as woven in the seasons shines with offspring, cattle\nand the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom, reaches the full length of life, lives gloriously, becomes\ngreat with offspring and cattle and great also with fame. His holy vow is that he should not find fault\nwith the seasons.\nII-xvii-1: The earth is Himkara, the sky is Prastava, heaven is Udgitha, the quarters are Pratihara, and\nthe ocean is Nidhana. This is the Sakvari Saman woven in the worlds.\nII-xvii-2: He who thus knows this Sakvari Saman woven in the worlds, becomes the possessor of the\nworlds, reaches the full length of life, lives gloriously, becomes great with offspring and cattle and\ngreat also with fame. His holy vow is that he should not find fault with the worlds.\n\nII-xviii-1: The goats are Himkara, the sheep are Prastava, the cows are Udgitha, the horses are\nPratihara, and man is Nidhana. This is the Revati Saman woven in the animals.\nII-xviii-2: He who thus knows this Revati Saman woven in the animals, becomes the possessor of\nanimals, reaches the full length of life, lives gloriously, becomes great with offspring and cattle, great\nalso with fame. His holy vow is that he should not find fault with animals.\nII-xix-1: The hair is Himkara, the skin is Prastava, the flesh is Udgitha, the bone is Pratihara, and the\nmarrow is Nidhana. This is the Yajnayajniya Saman woven in the limbs of the body.\nII-xix-2: He who thus knows this Yajnayajniya Saman, woven in the limbs of the body, is endowed\nwith all the limbs, and is not crippled in any limb; he reaches the full length of life, lives gloriously,\nbecomes great with offspring and cattle and great also with fame. His holy vow is that he should not eat\nfish and meat for a year, or rather, he should not eat fish and meat at all.\nII-xx-1: Fire is Himkara, Air is Prastava, the Sun is Udgitha, the Stars are Pratihara, and the Moon is\nNidhana. This is the Rajana Saman woven in the deities.\nII-xx-2: He who knows thus knows this Rajana Saman woven in the deities, abides in the same world\nor gets the same prosperity as these very deities or attains union with them; he reaches the full length of\nlife, lives gloriously, becomes great with offspring and cattle and great also with fame. His holy vow is\nthat he should not find fault with the Brahmanas.\nII-xxi-1: The three Vedas are Himkara; the three worlds are Prastava; Fire, Air and the Sun are Udgitha;\nthe Stars, the birds and the rays are Pratihara; the serpents, the celestial singers and the fathers are\nNidhana. This is the collection of Samans woven in all things.\nII-xxi-2: Verily, he who thus knows this collection of Samans as woven in all things becomes the lord\nof all things.\nII-xxi-3: There is this verse about it: That which is fivefold in groups of three \u2013 there is nothing else\ngreater or other than these (fifteen).\nII-xxi-4: He who knows that knows all. All the quarters bring offerings to him. His holy vow is that he\nshould meditate \u2018I am all\u2019 \u2013 yea, that is his vow.\nII-xxii-1: \u2018Of the Samans, I choose the one that bellows, as it were, and is good for cattle,\u2019 thus (some\nthink). This is the loud singing sacred to Agni, the undefined one to Prajapati, the defined one to Soma,\nthe soft and smooth to Vayu, the smooth and strong to Indra, the heron-like to Brihaspati, and the illsounding to Varuna. Verily, one may practise all these, but should avoid the one sacred to Varuna.\nII-xxii-2: \u2018May I obtain immortality for the gods by singing\u2019, (thinking) thus one should sing. \u2018May I\nobtain my singing, oblation for the fathers, hope for men, grass and water for animals, the heavenly\nworld for the sacrificer, and food for myself\u2019, -- thus reflecting in his mind on all these, he should sing\nthe Stotra attentively.\nII-xxii-3: All vowels are the embodiments of Indra; all sibilants are the embodiments of Prajapati; all\nSparsa consonants are the embodiments of Death. If anyone should reprove him for the pronunciation\nof his vowels, he should tell him, \u2018I have taken my refuge in Indra; he will answer you.\u2019\nII-xxii-4: And if some one should reprove him for sibilants he should tell him, \u2018I have taken my refuge\nin Prajapati; he will crush you\u2019. And if some one should reprove him for his Sparsa consonants, he\nshould tell him, \u2018I have taken my refuge in Death; he will burn you up.\u2019\nII-xxii-5: All vowels should be pronounced sonant and strong, (with the thought), \u2018May I impart\nstrength to Indra (Prana)\u2019. All sibilants should be pronounced, neither inarticulately, nor leaving out the\nelements of sound, but distinctly (with the thought), \u2018May I give myself to Prajapati (Virat).\u2019 All Sparsa\nconsonants should be pronounced slowly, without mixing them with any other letter, (with the thought),\n\u2018May I withdraw myself from Death.\u2019\n\nII-xxiii-1: Three are the branches of religious duty. Sacrifice, study and gifts \u2013 these are the first.\nAusterity alone is the second, and the celibate student of sacred knowledge, who lives in the house of\nthe teacher throughout his life mortifying his body in the teacher\u2019s house, is the third. All these become\npossessors of meritorious worlds; but he who is established firmly in Brahman, attains immortality.\nII-xxiii-2: Prajapati brooded on the worlds. From them, thus brooded upon, issued forth the threefold\nVeda (as their essence). He brooded on this. From this, thus brooded upon, issued forth the syllables\nBhuh, Bhuvah and Svah.\nII-xxiii-3: He brooded on them. From them, thus brooded upon, issued forth (as their essence) the\nsyllable Om (Brahman). Just as all the parts of the leaf, are permeated by the ribs of the leaf, so are all\nthe words permeated by the syllable Om. Verily, the syllable Om is all this \u2013 yea, the syllable Om is\nverily all this.\nII-xxiv-1-2: The expounders of Brahman say, \u2018The morning libation is of the Vasus, the midday libation\nis of the Rudras and the third libation is of the Adityas and of the Visvadevas. Where, the, is the world\nof the sacrificer ?\u2019 How can he who does not know this, perform (sacrifices) ? It is only after knowing\nthis that he should perform (sacrifices).\nII-xxiv-3-4: Before the commencement of the morning chant, the sacrificer sits down behind the\nGarhapatya fire, facing the north and sings the Saman sacred to the Vasus: \u2018(O Fire), open the door of\nthis world that we may see you for obtaining the kingdom.\u2019\nII-xxiv-5-6: Then he offers the oblation (with the Mantra) \u2013 \u2018Salutation to Fire, who dwells in the\nregion of the earth. Obtain the region, for me the sacrificer. This region, indeed, is to be obtained by the\nsacrificer. At the end of the duration of this life, I, the sacrificer, am willing to come here \u2013 Svaha.\u2019\n\u2018Unbar the door of the region\u2019, saying this he gets up. (As a result) the Vasus grant him (the region\nconnected with) the morning libation.\nII-xxiv-7-8: Before the starting of the midday libation, the sacrificer sits down behind the Agnidhriya\nfire, facing the north, and sings the Saman sacred to the Rudras: \u2018(O Fire), open the door of the region\nof the sky that we may see you for obtaining the sovereignty of the sky.\u2019\nII-xxiv-9-10: Then he offers the oblation (with the Mantra): \u2018Salutation to Vayu, who dwells in the\nregion of the sky. Obtain this region for me, the sacrificer. This region, indeed, is to be obtained by the\nsacrificer. At the end of the duration of this life, I, the sacrificer, am willing to go there \u2013 Svaha\u2019.\n\u2018Unbar the door of the region\u2019, saying this he gets up. (As a result) the Rudras grant him (the region of\nthe sky connected with) the midday libation.\nII-xxiv-11-13: Before beginning the third libation, the sacrificer sits down behind the Ahavaniya fire,\nfacing the north, and sings the Saman sacred to the Adityas and the one sacred to the Visvadevas: \u2018(O\nFire), open the door of the region of heaven that we may see you for obtaining the sovereignty of\nheaven\u2019. This is the Saman sacred to the Adityas. Next is the one sacred to the Visvadevas; \u2018(O Fire),\nopen the door of the region of heaven that we may see you for obtaining the supreme sovereignty.\u2019\nII-xxiv-14-15: Then the sacrificer offers the oblation (with the Mantra): \u2018Salutation to the Adityas and\nto the Visvadevas, the inhabitants of the region of heaven. Obtain the region of heaven for me, the\nsacrificer. This region, indeed, is to be obtained by the sacrificer. At the end of the duration of this life,\nI, the sacrificer, am willing to go there \u2013 Svaha\u2019. \u2018Unbar the door of the region\u2019, saying this, he gets up.\nII-xxiv-16: The Adityas and the Visvadevas grant him (the region appropriate to) the third libation. He\nalone knows the real character of the sacrifice, who knows thus.\nIII-i-1: Om. The yonder sun indeed is the honey of the gods. Of this honey, heaven is the cross-beam,\nthe sky is the honey comb, and (the water particles in) the rays are the eggs.\nIII-i-2-3: The eastern rays of that sun are its eastern honey-cells; the Riks are the bees, (the ritual of) the\nRig-Veda is the flower and those waters are the nectar. Those very Riks (the bees) pressed this RigVeda. From it, thus pressed, issued forth as juice, fame, splendour (of limbs), (alertness of) the senses,\n\nvirility, and food for eating.\nIII-i-4: That juice flowed forth; it settled by the side of the sun. Verily, this it is that appears as the red\nhue of the sun.\nIII-ii-1: And its southern rays are its southern honey cells. The Yajus verses are the bees. The YajurVeda is the flower; and those waters are the nectar.\nIII-ii-2: Those very Yajus verses pressed this Yajur-Veda. And from it, thus pressed, issued forth as\njuice, fame, splendour of limbs, alertness of the senses, virility, and food for eating.\nIII-ii-3: It, flowed forth; it settled by the side of the sun. Verily, this it is that appears as the white hue of\nthe sun.\nIII-iii-1: And its western rays are its western honey cells. The Samans are the bees. The Sama-Veda is\nthe flower; and those waters are the nectar.\nIII-iii-2: Those very Samans pressed this Sama-Veda. From it, thus pressed, issued forth as juice, fame,\nsplendour of limbs, alertness of the senses, virility, and food for eating.\nIII-iii-3: It flowed forth; it settled by the side of the sun. Verily, this it is that appears as the black hue of\nthe sun.\nIII-iv-1: And its northern rays are its northern honey cells. The Mantras of the Atharva-Veda are the\nbees. The Itihasa and the Purana are the flower; and those waters are the nectar.\nIII-iv-2: Those Mantras of the Atharva-Veda pressed this Itihasa-Purana. From it, thus pressed, issued\nforth as juice, fame, splendour of limbs, alertness of the senses, virility, and food for eating.\nIII-iv-3: It flowed forth; it settled by the side of the sun. Verily, this it is that appears as the deep black\nhue of the sun.\nIII-v-1: And its upper rays are its upper honey cells. The secret teachings are the bees. Brahman\n(Pranava) is the flower. Those waters (the results of the meditations on the Pranava) are the nectar.\nIII-v-2: Those secret teachings pressed this Pranava. From it, thus pressed, issued forth as juice, fame,\nsplendour of limbs, alertness of the senses, virility, and food for eating.\nIII-v-3: It flowed forth; it settled by the side of the sun. Verily, this it is that appears as the quivering in\nthe middle of the sun.\nIII-v-4: Verily, these hues are the juice of the juices, for the Vedas are the essences and these are their\nessence. These hues indeed are the nectar of the nectars, for the Vedas are the nectar and these are their\nnectar.\nIII-vi-1: That which is the first nectar (i.e. the red form), that verily Vasus enjoy with Agni as their\nleader. The gods, indeed, neither eat nor drink, only with seeing this nectar are they satisfied.\nIII-vi-2: They enter into this very form (colour) and out of this form they emerge.\nIII-vi-3: He who knows thus this nectar becomes one of the Vasus, and with Agni as the leader, is\nsatisfied only with seeing this nectar. He enters into this very form and out of this form he emerges.\nIII-vi-4: As long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, so long does he retain the sovereignty\nand the heavenly kingdom of (or similar to that of) the Vasus.\nIII-vii-1: And that which is the second nectar (i.e. the white form), that verily the Rudras enjoy with\nIndra as their leader. The gods, indeed, neither eat nor drink; only with seeing this nectar are they\nsatisfied.\nIII-vii-2: They enter into this very form and out of this form they emerge.\nIII-vii-3: He who knows thus this nectar becomes one of the Rudras, and with Indra as the leader, is\nsatisfied only with seeing this nectar. He enters into this very form and out of this form he emerges.\nIII-vii-4: As long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, even twice so long does he (the Sun)\n\nrise in the south and set in the north and even so long does he retain the sovereignty and the heavenly\nkingdom of the Rudras.\nIII-viii-1: And that which is the third nectar (i.e. the black form), that verily the Adityas enjoy with\nVaruna as their leader. The gods, indeed, neither eat nor drink; only with seeing this nectar are they\nsatisfied.\nIII-viii-2: They enter into this very form and out of this form they emerge.\nIII-viii-3: He who knows thus this nectar becomes one of the Adityas, and with Varuna as the leader, is\nsatisfied only with seeing this nectar. He enters into this very form and out of this form he emerges.\nIII-viii-4: As long as the sun rises in the south and sets in the north, even twice so long does he (the\nSun) rise in the west and set in the east and even so long does he retain the sovereignty and the\nheavenly kingdom of the Adityas.\nIII-ix-1: And that which is the fourth nectar (i.e. the deep black colour), that verily the Maruts enjoy\nwith Soma as their leader. The gods, indeed, neither eat nor drink; only with seeing this nectar are they\nsatisfied.\nIII-ix-2: They enter into this very form and out of this form they emerge.\nIII-ix-3: He who knows thus this nectar becomes one of the Maruts, and with Soma as the leader is\nsatisfied only with seeing this nectar.\nIII-ix-4: As long as the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, even twice so long does he (the Sun)\nrise in the north and set in the south and even so long does he retain the sovereignty and the heavenly\nkingdom of the Maruts.\nIII-x-1: And that which is the fifth nectar (i.e. the quivering form within the sun), that verily the\nSadhyas enjoy with Pranava as their leader. The gods, indeed, neither eat nor drink; only with seeing\nthis nectar are they satisfied.\nIII-x-2: They enter into this very form and out of this form they emerge.\nIII-x-3: He who knows thus this nectar becomes one of the Sadhyas, and with Pranava as the leader is\nsatisfied only with seeing this nectar.\nIII-x-4: As long as the sun rises in the north and sets in the south, even twice so long does he (the Sun)\nrise in overhead and set below and even so long does he retain the sovereignty and the heavenly\nkingdom of the Sadhyas.\nIII-xi-1: Then, rising from there upward, he will neither rise nor set. He will remain alone in the\nmiddle. There is this verse about it:\nIII-xi-2: \u2018Never does this happen there. Never did the sun set there nor did it rise. O gods, by this, my\nassertion of the truth, may I not fall from Brahman\u2019.\nIII-xi-3: Verily, for him the sun neither rises nor sets. He who thus knows this secret of the Vedas, for\nhim, there is perpetual day.\nIII-xi-4: Hiranyagarbha imparted this Doctrine of Honey to Prajapati, Prajapati to Manu, and Manu to\nhis progeny. And the father told his eldest son Uddalaka Aruni this very knowledge of Brahman.\nIII-xi-5: A father may declare to his eldest son or to any other worthy disciple this very knowledge of\nHoney.\nIII-xi-6: And not to any one else, even if one should offer him this sea-girt earth filled with wealth. This\n(doctrine) is certainly greater than that. This certainly is greater than that.\nIII-xii-1: Gayatri indeed is all this, whatever being exists. Speech indeed is Gayatri; for speech indeed\nsings and removes fear of all this that exists.\nIII-xii-2: That which is this Gayatri, even that is this earth; for on this earth are all the beings\nestablished and they do not transcend it.\n\nIII-xii-3: That which is this earth (as Gayatri), even that is this, i.e. this body in respect of this person;\nfor these senses are indeed established in this body and they do not transcend it.\nIII-xii-4: That which is the body in respect of a person, even that is identical with) the heart within this\nbody; for these senses are indeed established in it and they do not transcend it.\nIII-xii-5: This well-known Gayatri is four footed and sixfold. The Gayatri Brahman is thus expressed in\nthe following Rik:\nIII-xii-6: Such is the greatness of this (Brahman called Gayatri). The Person is even greater than this.\nAll this world is a quarter of Him, the other three quarters of His constitute immortality in heaven.\nIII-xii-7-9: That which is (designated as) Brahman, even that is this Akasa outside the body. That which\nis the Akasa outside the body, even that is the Akasa inside the body. That which is the Akasa inside the\nbody, even that is this Akasa within the (lotus of the) heart. This Brahman is all-filling and unchanging.\nHe who knows (Brahman) thus, gets all-filling and unchanging prosperity.\nIII-xiii-1: Of the said heart, there are, indeed, five doors guarded by the gods. (He who is in) that which\nis the eastern door of this, is Prana. He is the eye, he is the sun. This (Brahman called Prana) should be\nmeditated upon as brightness and as the source of food. He who meditates thus, becomes resplendent\nand an eater of food.\nIII-xiii-2: And (he who is in) that which is the southern door of this (heart), is Vyana. He is the ear, he is\nthe moon. This (Brahman called Vyana) should be meditated upon as prosperity and fame. He who\nmeditates thus becomes prosperous and famous.\nIII-xiii-3: And (he who is in) that which is the western door of this (heart), is Apana. He is speech, he is\nfire. This (Brahman called Apana) should be meditated upon as the holy effulgence born of sacred\nwisdom and as the source of food. He who meditates thus becomes radiant with the holy effulgence\nborn of sacred wisdom and also an eater of food.\nIII-xiii-4: And (he who is in) that which is the northern door of this (heart), is Samana. He is the mind,\nhe is Parjanya (the rain-god). This (Brahman called Samana) should be meditated upon as fame and\ngrace. He who meditates thus becomes famous and graceful.\nIII-xiii-5: And (he who is in) that which is the upper door of this (heart), is Udana. He is the air, he is\nthe Akasa. This (Brahman called Udana) should be meditated upon as strength and nobility. He who\nmeditates thus becomes strong and noble.\nIII-xiii-6: These, verily, are the five persons under Brahman, the sentinels of the heavenly world. He\nwho adores thus these five persons under Brahman, the sentinels of the heavenly world, in his family is\na hero born. He who adores thus these five persons under Brahman, the sentinels of the heavenly world,\nreaches the heavenly world.\nIII-xiii-7: Again, the light of Brahman that shines above this heaven, above everything, above all, in the\nincomparably good and the highest worlds, even this is the light within the body of man. This light can\nbe seen inasmuch as one has a perception of warmth when one touches the body. It can be heard\ninasmuch as, on closing the ears, one hears something like the sound of a chariot or the bellowing of a\nbull, or the sound of a blazing fire. One should meditate on the light as seen and heard. One who\nmeditates on this thus, becomes beautiful and illustrious \u2013 yea, one who meditates thus.\nIII-xiv-1: Verily, all this universe is Brahman. From Him do all things originate, into Him do they\ndissolve and by Him are they sustained. On Him should one meditate in tranquillity. For as is one\u2019s\nfaith, such indeed one is; and as is one\u2019s faith in this world, such one becomes on departing hence. Let\none, therefore, cultivate faith.\nIII-xiv-2-3: He, who is permeating the mind, who has Prana for his body, whose nature is\nconsciousness, whose resolve is infallible, whose own form is like Akasa, whose creation is all that\nexists, whose are all the pure desires, who possesses all the agreeable odours and all the pleasant tastes,\nwho exists pervading all this, who is without speech (and other senses), who is free from agitation and\n\neagerness \u2013 this my Atman, residing in (the lotus of) the heart \u2013 is smaller than a grain of paddy, than a\nbarley corn, than a mustard seed, than a grain of millet or than the kernel of a grain of millet. This my\nAtman residing in (the lotus of) the heart is greater than the earth, greater than the sky, greater than\nheaven, greater than all these worlds.\nIII-xiv-4: He, whose creation is all that exists, whose are all the pure desires, who possesses all the\nagreeable odours and all the pleasant tastes, who exists pervading all this, who is without speech (and\nother senses), who is free from agitation and eagerness, He is my Atman residing in (the lotus of) the\nheart; He is Brahman. On departing hence I shall attain to His being. He alone who possesses this faith\nand has no doubt about it (will obtain the result). Thus declared Sandilya \u2013 yea, Sandilya.\nIII-xv-1: The chest (i.e. the universe), having the sky as its hollow and the earth for its (curved) bottom,\ndoes not decay. The quarters are indeed its corners and heaven its upper lid. This well-known chest is\nthe container of wealth. All things rest in it.\nIII-xv-2: Of that chest, the eastern quarter is named Juhu, the southern is named Sahamana, the western\nis named Rajni and the northern is named Subhuta. The air is their calf. He who knows this air, the calf\nof the quarters, thus (as immortal), never weeps in mourning for his son. I, wishing my son\u2019s, longevity,\nworship thus this air, the calf of the quarters. May I never weep to mourn my son.\nIII-xv-3: I take refuge in the imperishable chest for such and such and such. I take refuge in Prana for\nsuch and such and such. I take refuge in Bhuh for such and such and such. I take refuge in Bhuvah for\nsuch and such and such. I take refuge in Svah for such and such and such.\nIII-xv-4: When I said, \u2018I take refuge in Prana\u2019, (it was because) all these beings, whatsoever exist, are\nindeed Prana. So it was in this alone that I took refuge.\nIII-xv-5: Then when I said, \u2018I take refuge in Bhuh\u2019, I said only this: \u2018I take refuge in the earth, I take\nrefuge in the sky, I take refuge in heaven\u2019.\nIII-xv-6: Then when I said, \u2018I take refuge in Bhuvah\u2019, I said only this: \u2018I take refuge in Fire, I take\nrefuge in Air, I take refuge in the Sun.\u2019\nIII-xv-7: Then, when I said, \u2018I take refuge in Svah\u2019, I said only this: \u2018I take refuge in the Rig-Veda, I\ntake refuge in the Yajur-Veda, I take refuge in the Sama-Veda\u2019 \u2013 yea, that was what I said.\nIII-xvi-1: Man, truly, is the sacrifice. His (first) twenty-four years are the morning libation, for the\nmetre Gayatri is made up of twenty-four syllables, and the morning libation is related to the Gayatri\nmetre. With this the Vasus are connected. The Pranas indeed are the Vasus, for they make all this stable.\nIII-xvi-2: During this period of life if anything (e.g. illness) causes him pain, he should repeat: \u2018O\nPranas, Vasus, unite this morning libation of mind with the midday libation. May I who am a sacrifice\nnot be lost in the midst of the Vasus who are the Pranas\u2019. He surely recovers from that and becomes\nhealthy.\nIII-xvi-3: Now, (his next) forty-four years are the mid-day libation, (for) the metre Tristubh is made up\nof forty-four syllables, and the mid-day libation is related to the Tristubh metre. With this, the Rudras\nare connected. The Pranas indeed are the Rudras, for they cause all this (universe) to weep.\nIII-xvi-4: During this period of life if anything (e.g. illness) causes him pain, he should repeat: \u2018O\nPranas, Rudras, unite this mid-day libation of mine with the third libation. May I, who am a sacrifice,\nnot be lost in the midst of the Rudras who are the Pranas\u2019. He surely recovers from that and becomes\nhealthy.\nIII-xvi-5: Then (his next) forty-eight years are the third libation. The metre Jagati is made up of fortyeight syllables and the third libation is related to the Jagati metre. With this, the Adityas are connected.\nThe Pranas indeed are the Adityas, for they accept all this.\nIII-xvi-6: During this period of life if anything (e.g. illness) causes him pain, he should repeat: \u2018O\nPranas, Adityas, extend this third libation of mine to a full length of life. May I, who am a sacrifice, not\nbe lost in the midst of the Adityas who are the Pranas.\u2019 He surely recovers from that and becomes\n\nhealthy.\nIII-xvi-7: Knowing this well-known (doctrine of sacrifice) Aitareya Mahidasa said, \u2018Why do you afflict\nme thus, me who cannot be so killed.\u2019 He lived for one hundred and sixteen years. He, too, who knows\nthus, lives in vigour for one hundred and sixteen years.\nIII-xvii-1: That he (who performs the Purusha sacrifice) feels hunger, that he feels thirst, that he does\nnot rejoice \u2013all these are the initiatory rites of this sacrifice.\nIII-xvii-2: And, that he eats that he drinks, that he rejoices \u2013 all these approach Upasadas.\nIII-xvii-3: And, that he laughs, that he eats, that he behaves as one of a couple \u2013 all these approach\nStotra and Sastra.\nIII-xvii-4: And his austerity, gifts, uprightness, non-violence, and truthfulness \u2013 all these are the\nlargesses of this sacrifice.\nIII-xvii-5: Therefore people say \u2018sosyati\u2019 (will procreate), and \u2018asosta\u2019 (has procreated). Again, that is\nthe procreation of this, and death is the Avabhrita bath.\nIII-xvii-6: Ghora Angirasa expounded this well-known doctrine to Devaki\u2019s son Krishna and said,\n\u2018Such a knower should, at the time of death, repeat this triad \u2013 \"Thou art the imperishable, Thou art\nunchangeable, Thou art the subtle essence of Prana\". (On hearing the above) he became thirstless.\nThere are these two Rik stanzas in regard to this.\nIII-xvii-7: (Those knowers of Brahman who have purified their mind through the withdrawal of the\nsenses and other means like Brahmacharya) see everywhere (the day \u2013 like the supreme light) of the\nancient One who is the seed of the universe, (the light that shines in the Effulgent Brahman). May we,\ntoo having perceived the highest light which dispels darkness, reach it. Having perceived the highest\nlight in our own heart we have reached that highest light, which is the dispeller (of water, rays of light\nand the Pranas), shining in all gods \u2013 yea, we have reached that highest light.\nIII-xviii-1: The mind is Brahman, thus one should meditate \u2013 this is (the meditation) with regard to the\nbody (including the mind). Next, the meditation with regard to the gods \u2013 the Akasa is Brahman, thus\n(one should meditate). Both the meditations, with regard to the body and with regard to the gods are\nbeing enjoined.\nIII-xviii-2: This same Brahman has four feet. The organ of speech is one foot. Prana (the organ of\nsmell) is one foot, the eye is one foot and the ear is one foot. This is with reference to the body. Next,\nwith reference to the gods. Agni is one foot, Vayu is one foot, Aditya is one foot and the quarters are\none foot. Thus both the meditations, with reference to the body and with reference to the gods, are\nenjoined.\nIII-xviii-3: The organ of speech is one of the four feet of Brahman (called Mind). With the light of fire\nit shines and warms. He who knows thus, shines and warms with fame and celebrity and with the holy\neffulgence born of sacred wisdom.\nIII-xviii-4: The organ of smell is one of the four feet of Brahman. With the light of air it shines and\nwarms. He who knows thus, shines and warms with fame and celebrity and with the holy effulgence\nborn of sacred wisdom.\nIII-xviii-5: The eye is one of the four feet of Brahman. With the light of the sun it shines and warms.\nHe who knows thus, shines and warms with fame and celebrity and with the holy effulgence born of\nsacred wisdom.\nIII-xviii-6: The ear is one of the four feet of Brahman. With the light of the quarters it shines and\nwarms. He who knows thus, shines and warms with fame and celebrity and with the holy effulgence\nborn of sacred wisdom \u2013 yea, he who knows thus.\nIII-xix-1: The Sun is Brahman \u2013 this is the teaching. The further explanation of this (is here given).\nBefore creation, this universe was non-existent. Then it became existent. It grew; it turned into an egg;\nit lay for a period of one year; (and then) it burst open. Of the two halves of that egg-shell, one was of\n\nsilver and the other of gold.\nIII-xix-2: Of these, that which was of silver is this earth. That which was of gold is heaven. That which\nwas the outer membrane is the mountains. That which was the inner membrane is the mist together\nwith the clouds. Those which were the veins are the rivers. That which was the water in the lower belly\nis the ocean.\nIII-xix-3: And that which was born is the yonder sun. After he was born, sounds of the form of loud\nshouts arose, as also all beings and all desired objects. Therefore at his rise and his every return (or his\nsetting), sounds of the form of loud shouts arise, as also all beings and all desired objects.\nIII-xix-4: He who knows the Sun thus and meditates on it as Brahman, auspicious sounds will hasten to\nhim and continue to delight him \u2013 yea, will continue to delight.\nIV-i-1: Om. There lived Janasruti Pautrayana who made gifts with respect, who gave liberally, and who\nhad much food cooked (for others). He built rest-houses all round, thinking, \u2018Everywhere people will\neat of my food\u2019.\nIV-i-2: Once at night, the swans flew along. Then one swan addressed another swan thus, \u2018Ho, Ho, O\nBhallaksa, Bhallaksa, the effulgence of Janasruti Pautrayana has spread like the heaven. Do not come\nin touch with it, lest it should scorch you.\u2019\nIV-i-3: Bhallaksa replied to him, \u2018lo, how could you so describe him as if he were Raikva with the\ncart ?\u2019 \u2018Of what sort is this Raikva with the cart ?\u2019\nIV-i-4: \u2018Just as all the lower casts of the dice go over to one who has won the Krita-cast, so does go\nover to Raikva whatsoever good the creatures do; so also to him who knows what Raikva knows. Such\nis he who has thus been spoken of by me.\u2019\nIV-i-5-6: Janasruti Pautrayana overheard those words. As soon as he arose, he said to the attendant,\n\u2018Lo, did you praise me like Raikva with the cart ?\u2019 \u2018What sort of man is this Raikva with the cart ?\u2019\n(Janasruti repeated the words of the swan): \u2018Just as all the lower casts of the dice go over to one who\nhas won the Krita-cast, so does go over to Raikva whatsoever good the creatures do; and so also to him\nwho knows what Raikva knows. Such is he who has thus been spoken of by me\u2019.\nIV-i-7: The attendant, having searched for him, came back thinking, \u2018I could not find him\u2019. Janasruti\nsaid to him, \u2018Well, where the knower of Brahman should be searched for there search for him\u2019.\nIV-i-8: (After searching) he came to a man sitting under a cart and scratching eruptions on his skin and,\nsitting near him, asked him, \u2018Revered sir, are you Raikva with the cart ?\u2019 \u2018Well fellow, yes, I am\u2019, he\nadmitted. Thinking \u2018I have found him\u2019, the attendant returned.\nIV-ii-1-2: On hearing this, Janasruti Pautrayana took with him six hundred cows, a gold necklace, and a\nchariot drawn by mules and went to Raikva and addressed him thus: \u2018O Raikva, (here are for you) these\nsix hundred cows, this gold necklace, and this chariot drawn by mules. Now, revered sir, instruct me\nabout the deity whom you worship.\u2019\nIV-ii-3: The other man answered him thus: \u2018Ah, O Sudra, let this gold necklace together with the\nchariot and the cows remain with you.\u2019 Thereupon Janasruti Pautrayana again took with him one\nthousand cows, a gold necklace, a chariot drawn by mules and his daughter and went over to Raikva.\nIV-ii-4: Janasruti said to him: \u2018O Raikva, (here are for you) these one thousand cows, this gold\nnecklace, this chariot drawn by mules, this wife, and this village in which you reside. Now, revered sir,\nplease instruct me\u2019.\nIV-ii-5: Taking that princess to be the portal for the conveying of knowledge, Raikva said, \u2018O Sudra,\nyou have brought all these ! Even by this means (i.e. the princess) you will make me talk.\u2019 The king\ngave away to him all those villages in the Mahavrisa country known as Raikvaparna where Raikva\nlived. Raikva said to him:\nIV-iii-1: Air indeed is the absorber. For when a fire goes out, it is in air that it merges; when the sun\nsets, it is in air that it merges; when the moon sets, it is in air that it merges.\n\nIV-iii-2: When water dries up, it is in air that it merges; for air absorbs all these. This is (the doctrine of\nSamvarga) with reference to the gods.\nIV-iii-3: Next is (the doctrine of Samvarga) with reference to the body: Prana indeed is the absorber.\nWhen one sleeps, speech merges in Prana, the eye merges in Prana, the ear merges in Prana, the mind\nmerges in Prana: for Prana, indeed, absorbs all these.\nIV-iii-4: These, indeed, are the two absorbers: Air among the gods and Prana among the sense-organs.\nIV-iii-5: Once upon a time, while Kapeya Saunaka and Kaksaseni Abhipratarin were being served with\nfood, a celibate student of sacred knowledge begged of them. They did not give him anything.\nIV-iii-6: The Brahmacharin said, \u2018Prajapati, the one god swallowed up the four great ones; he is the\nprotector of the worlds. O Kapeya, O Abhipratarin, mortals do not see him who dwells variously. Even\nfrom him, for whom all this food is meant, you have withheld it.\u2019\nIV-iii-7: Kapeya Saunaka, reflecting on those words, approached him (and said): \u2018He who is the self of\nall gods and the creator of all beings, who has undecaying teeth, who is the devourer, who is the wise\none, who is himself never eaten (but) who devours even those who are not food; and hence (the\nknowers) describe his magnificence as immeasurable \u2013 such, indeed, is the Brahman, O Brahmacharin,\nwhom we worship\u2019. (Then he told the servants): \u2018Give him food\u2019.\nIV-iii-8: They gave him food. Now, these five and the other five, together becoming ten, constitute the\nKrita (dice-cast). Therefore (i.e. because the number ten applies to both), these ten are the food or Virat\ndwelling in all the ten quarters, and these are (the enjoyer) Krita. This Virat, of the form of ten deities,\nagain, is the eater of food (as Krita); by him all this is perceived. He who sees thus, by him also all this\nis perceived, and he becomes as eater of food.\nIV-iv-1: Once upon a time Satyakama Jabala addressed his mother Jabala, \u2018Mother, I desire to live the\nlife of a celibate student of sacred knowledge in the teacher\u2019s house. Of what lineage am I ?\u2019\nIV-iv-2: She said to him, \u2018My child, I do not know of what lineage you are. I, who was engaged in\nmany works and in attending on others, got you in my youth. Having been such I could not know of\nwhat lineage you are. However, I am Jabala by name and you are named Satyakama. So you speak of\nyourself only as Satyakama Jabala.\u2019\nIV-iv-3: He went to Haridrumata Gautama and said, \u2018I desire to live under you, revered sir, as a\nBrahmacharin; may I approach your venerable self (for the same) ?\u2019\nIV-iv-4: Gautama asked him, \u2018Dear boy, of what lineage are you ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018Sir, I do not know of\nwhat lineage I am. I asked my mother; she replied, \"I, who was engaged in many works and in\nattending on others, got you in my youth. Having been such, I could not know of what lineage you are.\nHowever, I am Jabala by name and you are named Satyakama\". So, sir, I am Satyakama Jabala.\u2019\nIV-iv-5: The teacher said to him, \u2018No one who is not a Brahmana can speak thus. Dear boy, bring the\nsacrificial fuel, I shall initiate you as a Brahmacharin, for you have not deviated from truth\u2019. Having\ninitiated him, he sorted out four hundred lean and weak cows and said, \u2018Dear boy, follow them.\u2019 While\nhe was driving them towards the forest Satyakama said, \u2018I shall not return till it is one thousand.\u2019 He\nlived away for a long time, till they had increased to one thousand.\nIV-v-1: Then the bull addressed him thus, \u2018Satyakama !\u2019 \u2018Yes, revered sir\u2019, thus he responded, \u2018Dear\nboy, we have reached a thousand, take us to the house of the teacher.\u2019\nIV-v-2: \u2018Let me instruct you about one foot of Brahman also\u2019. \u2018Please instruct me, revered sir.\u2019 (The\nbull) said to him, \u2018The eastern quarter is one part, the western quarter is one part, the southern quarter is\none part, the northern quarter is one part. This indeed, dear boy, is one foot of Brahman, consisting of\nfour, named the Radiant.\nIV-v-3: \u2018He who knows this one foot of Brahman consisting of four parts thus, and meditates on it as\nthe Radiant, becomes radiant in this world. He who knows this one foot of Brahman consisting of four\nparts thus, and meditates on it as the Radiant, wins the radiant regions (in the next world).\u2019\n\nIV-vi-1: \u2018Fire will tell you of one foot of Brahman\u2019. At dawn of the next day he drove the cows towards\nthe teacher\u2019s house. Towards evening, at the place where those cows came together, he kindled the fire\nthere, penned the cows, laid on fuel and sat down near them behind the fire, facing the east.\nIV-vi-2: The fire addressed him, \u2018Satyakama !\u2019 \u2018Yes, revered sir\u2019, he responded.\nIV-vi-3: \u2018Dear boy, let me instruct you about one foot of Brahman\u2019. \u2018Please instruct me, revered sir.\u2019\n(The fire) said to him, \u2018The earth is one part, the sky is one part, heaven is one part, and the ocean is\none part. This indeed, dear boy, is one foot of Brahman, consisting of four parts, named the Endless.\nIV-vi-4: \u2018He who knows this one foot of Brahman consisting of four parts thus, and meditates on it as\nthe Endless, becomes endless in this world. He who knows this one foot of Brahman consisting of four\nparts thus, and meditates on it as the Endless, wins the endless (undecaying) regions.\u2019\nIV-vii-1: \u2018The swan will tell you of one foot of Brahman\u2019. At dawn of the next day, he drove the cows\ntowards the teacher\u2019s house. Towards evening, at the place where the cows came together, he kindled\nthe fire there, penned the cows, laid on fuel and sat down near them behind the fire facing the east.\nIV-vii-2: The swan flew to him and addressed him, \u2018Satyakama !\u2019 \u2018Yes, revered sir\u2019, he responded.\nIV-vii-3: \u2018Dear boy, let me instruct you about one foot of Brahman\u2019. \u2018Please instruct me revered sir.\u2019\n(The swan) said to him, \u2018Fire is one part, the sun is one part, the moon is one part, and lightning is one\npart. This indeed, dear boy, is one foot of Brahman, consisting of four parts, named the Effulgent.\nIV-vii-4: \u2018He who knows this one foot of Brahman consisting of four parts thus, and meditates on it as\nthe Effulgent, becomes effulgent in this world. He who knows this one foot of Brahman consisting of\nfour parts thus, and meditates on it as the Effulgent, wins the effulgent regions (of the sun, the moon,\netc., in the next world).\u2019\nIV-viii-1: \u2018Madgu will tell you of one foot of Brahman\u2019. At dawn of the next day, he drove the cows\ntowards the teacher\u2019s house. Towards evening at the place where the cows came together, he kindled\nthe fire there, penned the cows, laid on fuel and sat down near them behind the fire facing the east.\nIV-viii-2: The Madgu bird flew to him and addressed him, \u2018Satyakama !\u2019 \u2018Yes, revered sir\u2019, he\nresponded.\nIV-viii-3: \u2018Dear boy, let me instruct you about one foot of Brahman\u2019. \u2018Please instruct me, revered sir\u2019.\n(The Madgu bird) said to him, \u2018Prana is one part, the eye is one part, the ear is one part, and the mind is\none part. This indeed, dear boy, is one foot of Brahman, consisting of four parts, named the Repository.\nIV-viii-4: \u2018He who knows this one foot of Brahman consisting of four parts thus, and meditates on it as\nthe Repository, becomes repository (i.e. with proper abode) in this world. He who knows this one foot\nof Brahman consisting of four parts thus, and meditates on it as the Repository, wins the repository (i.e.\nextensive) regions (in the next world).\u2019\nIV-ix-1: Satyakama reached the house of the teacher. The teacher addressed him, \u2018Satyakama !\u2019 \u2018Yes,\nrevered sir\u2019, he responded.\nIV-ix-2: \u2018Dear boy, you shine like a knower of Brahman; who is it that has instructed you ?\u2019 Satyakama\nassured him, \u2018People other than men. But I wish, revered sir, that you would expound it to me.\nIV-ix-3: \u2018I have definitely heard from persons like your venerable self that the knowledge directly\nlearnt from one\u2019s own teacher becomes most beneficial\u2019. The teacher taught him the same thing, and\nnothing was omitted from this \u2013 yea, nothing was omitted.\nIV-x-1: Once upon a time Upakosala Kamalayana lived with Satyakama Jabala the life of a\nBrahmacharin. He tended his fires for twelve years. Satyakama performed for other disciples the\nceremony of completing studies and returning home, but did not perform the ceremony for Upakosala.\nIV-x-2: The wife of the teacher said to him, \u2018This Brahmacharin has undergone severe austerities and\nhas tended the fires properly; you should teach him so that the fires may not blame you.\u2019 But the\nteacher went away on a journey without instructing him.\n\nIV-x-3: Through mental sufferings Upakosala began to fast. The wife of the teacher said to him, \u2018O\nBrahmacharin, do eat; why are you not eating ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018In this (very ordinary and disappointed)\nman (i.e. myself) there are many desires running in various directions; I am full of mental sufferings; so\nI shall not eat.\u2019\nIV-x-4: Thereupon the fires said among themselves, \u2018This Brahmacharin has undergone severe\nausterities and has tended us properly; come let us instruct him\u2019. They then said to him, \u2018Prana (life) is\nBrahman, Ka (joy) is Brahman, Kha (ether) is Brahman\u2019.\nIV-x-5: He said, \u2018I understand that Prana is Brahman; but I do not understand Ka and Kha.\u2019 They said,\n\u2018What is Ka, even that is Kha; and what is Kha, even that is Ka\u2019. Then the fires instructed him about\nPrana (Brahman) and the Akasa within the heart related to it.\nIV-xi-1: Then the Garhapatya fire instructed him: \u2018Earth, fire, food and the sun (are my forms). The\nperson who is seen in the sun, I am he, I am he, indeed.\u2019\nIV-xi-2: \u2018He who knows it thus and meditates on it, destroys sinful acts, wins the region (of fire),\nreaches the full length of life, lives gloriously, and his descendants never perish. We protect him in this\nworld and in the next, who knows it thus and meditates on it.\u2019\nIV-xii-1: Then the Anvaharyapacana fire instructed him: \u2018Water, the quarters, the stars and the moon\n(are my forms). The person who is seen in the moon, I am he, I am he indeed.\nIV-xii-2: \u2018He who knows it thus and meditates on it, destroys sinful acts, wins the region (of fire),\nreaches the full length of life, lives gloriously, and his descendants never perish. We protect him in this\nworld and in the next, who knows it thus and meditates on it.\u2019\nIV-xiii-1: Then the Ahavaniya fire instructed him, \u2018Prana, Akasa, heaven and lightning (are my forms).\nThe person who is seen in the lightning, I am he; I am he, indeed.\nIV-xiii-2: \u2018He who knows it thus and meditates on it, destroys sinful acts, wins the region (of fire),\nreaches the full length of life, lives gloriously, and his descendants never perish. We protect him in this\nworld and in the next, who knows it thus and meditates on it.\u2019\nIV-xiv-1: The fires said, \u2018O Upakosala, dear boy, to you (are revealed) this knowledge of the fires and\nthe knowledge of the Atman; but the teacher will tell you the way.\u2019 His teacher came back. The teacher\naddressed him \u2018Upakosala !\u2019\nIV-xiv-2: \u2018Yes, revered sir\u2019, he responded. \u2018Dear boy, your face shines like that of a knower of\nBrahman ! who is it that has instructed you ?\u2019 \u2018Who should instruct me sir ?\u2019, said he. Here he\nconcealed the truth, as it were. \u2018For this reason it is that though they were (formerly) otherwise they are\nnow this wise\u2019. So saying, he hinted at the (part played by the) fires in this matter. \u2018What did they tell\nyou, dear boy ?\u2019\nIV-xiv-3: \u2018This\u2019, thus he acknowledged. \u2018Dear boy, they have told you about the regions only; but I\nshall tell you the object of your desire (i.e. Brahman). Just as water does not cling to the lotus-leaf, so\nalso sin does not cling to him who knows Brahman thus\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, please instruct me further\u2019. (The\nteacher) said to him:\nIV-xv-1: \u2018This person who is seen in the eye, he is the Atman\u2019, said the teacher; \u2018this is the immortal,\nthe fearless. This is Brahman. Hence, even if one sprinkles clarified butter or water into the eye, it goes\naway to the edges.\u2019\nIV-xv-2: \u2018The knowers of Brahman call him as the centre of blessings; for all blessings come together\nin him. All blessings come together in him who knows thus.\u2019\nIV-xv-3: \u2018He, again, is the vehicle of blessings; for he carries all blessings. He who knows it thus\ncarries all blessings. He who knows it thus carries all blessings.\u2019\nIV-xv-4: \u2018He again, is the vehicle of light; for he shines in all the regions. He who knows it thus shines\n\nin all the regions.\u2019\nIV-xv-5: \u2018Now, as for such persons, whether the cremation rites are performed or not, they go to light;\nfrom light to the day; from the day to the bright fortnight; from the bright fortnight to those six months\nduring which (the sun) rises towards the north; from the months to the year; from the year to the sun;\nfrom the sun to the moon; from the moon to the lightning. (From the region of Brahman) a person, who\nis other than human, (comes and) causes them existing there, to realize Brahman. This is the path of the\ngods and the path to Brahman. Those who go by this path do not return to this human whirlpool \u2013 yes,\nthey do not return.\u2019\nIV-xvi-1: He who blows (i.e. air) is indeed the sacrifice, he, moving along, purifies all this. And\nbecause moving along he purifies all this, he is the sacrifice. Mind and speech are the two paths of this\nsacrifice.\nIV-xvi-2-3: One of these two paths, the Brahman priest embellishes with the mind. The Hotir,\nAdhvaryu and Udgatir priests embellish the other with speech. After the Prataranuvaka (the morning\nrecitation) is commenced, and before the Paridhaniya Rik is begun, if the Brahman priest speaks out\n(breaking silence), then he embellishes only one path (viz. Speech) and the other is injured. Just as a\nman walking with one leg, or a chariot moving with one wheel suffers injury, so also that sacrifice of\nthis one suffers injury, and when the sacrifice suffers injury, the sacrificer also suffers injury. For\nhaving completed the (defective) sacrifice, he becomes a worse sinner.\nIV-xvi-4: But, after the Prataranuvaka is commenced and before the Paridhaniya Rik is begun, if the\nBrahman priest does not break his silence then both the paths are embellished; and neither one is\ninjured.\nIV-xvi-5: And just as a man walking with both the legs, or a chariot moving with both the wheels,\nremains intact, so also the sacrifice of this one remains intact. If the sacrifice remains intact, the\nsacrificer also remains intact. He becomes great by performing the sacrifice.\nIV-xvii-1: Prajapati brooded on the worlds. From them thus brooded upon, he extracted their essences;\nfire from the earth, air from the sky and the sun from heaven.\nIV-xvii-2: He brooded on these three deities. From them thus brooded upon, he extracted their\nessences: the Riks from fire, the Yajus-mantras from air, and the Saman from the sun.\nIV-xvii-3: He brooded on the three Vedas. From them thus brooded upon, he extracted their existences;\nBhuh from the Riks, Bhuvah from the Yajus-mantras and Svah from the Samans.\nIV-xvii-4: Therefore if the sacrifice is rendered defective on account of the Riks, then with the Mantra\n\u2018Bhuh Svaha\u2019, (the Brahman priest) should offer an oblation in the Garhapatya fire. Thus verily,\nthrough the essence of the Riks, through the virility of the Riks, he makes good the injury of the\nsacrifice in respect of the Riks.\nIV-xvii-5: And if the sacrifice is rendered defective on account of the Yajus, then with the Mantra\n\u2018Bhuvah Svaha\u2019, (the Brahman priest) should offer an oblation in the Daksinagni. Thus verily, through\nthe essence of the Yajus-mantras, through the virility of the Yajus-mantras, he makes good the injury of\nthe sacrifice in respect of the Yajus-mantras.\nIV-xvii-6: And if the sacrifice is rendered defective on account of the Samans, then with the Mantra\n\u2018Svah Svaha\u2019 (the Brahman priest) should offer an oblation to the Ahavaniya fire. Thus verily, through\nthe essence of the Samans, through the virility of the Saman, he makes good the injury of the sacrifice\nin respect of the Samans.\nIV-xvii-7-8: Just as one would join gold with salt, silver with gold, tin with silver, lead with tin, iron\nwith lead, wood with iron, and wood with leather, even so does (the Brahman priest) make good the\ninjury of the sacrifice through the virility of these regions, of these deities, and of the three Vedas. That\nsacrifice indeed is healed where there is a Brahman priest knowing thus.\nIV-xvii-9: That sacrifice indeed becomes inclined to the north, where there is a Brahman priest\n\nknowing thus. It is in reference to the Brahman priest knowing thus that there is this song: \u2018Whence-soever the sacrifice comes back, thither verily does the Brahman priest go (to remedy)\u2019.\nIV-xvii-10: Just as the mare protects (the soldier), even so the silent Brahman priest is the only priest\nwho protects the people engaged in rituals. The Brahman priest who knows thus verily protects the\nsacrifice, the sacrificer, and all the priests. Hence one should appoint as a Brahman priest only him who\nknows thus, not one who does not know thus \u2013 yea, not one who does not know thus.\nV-i-1: Om, Verily, he who knows the eldest and the best, surely becomes the eldest and the best. Prana\nis indeed the eldest and the best (of the organs).\nV-i-2: Verily, he who knows the richest, becomes the richest among his own people. Speech is indeed\nthe richest.\nV-i-3: Verily, he who knows the stable basis, becomes stabilized in this world and in the next. The eye\nis indeed the stable basis.\nV-i-4: Verily, he who knows prosperity, attains all desires, both divine and human. The ear is indeed\nprosperity.\nV-i-5: Verily, he who knows the abode, becomes the abode of his people. The mind is indeed the abode.\nV-i-6: Now, once the five senses disputed among themselves about their personal superiority, saying \u2018I\nam superior\u2019.\nV-i-7: Those senses approached the father Prajapati and said to him, \u2018Revered sir, who is the best\namongst us ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018He amongst you is the best on whose departure the body would appear its\nworst, as it were.\u2019\nV-i-8: Speech departed. Staying a year out, it came back and asked, \u2018How have you been able to live\nwithout me ?\u2019 (The others replied,) \u2018Just like the dumb, though not speaking, yet living with the breath,\nseeing with the eyes, hearing with the ear and thinking with the mind.\u2019 (At this) speech entered (the\nbody).\nV-i-9: The eye departed. Staying a year out, it came back and asked, \u2018How have you been able to live\nwithout me ?\u2019 (The others replied,) \u2018Just like the blind, though not seeing, yet living with the breath,\nspeaking with the organ of speech, hearing with the ear and thinking with the mind.\u2019 (At this) the eye\nentered (the body).\nV-i-10: The ear departed. Staying a year out, it came back and asked, \u2018How have you been able to live\nwithout me ?\u2019 (The others replied,) \u2018Just like the deaf, though not hearing, yet living with the breath,\nspeaking with the organ of speech, seeing with the eye and thinking with the mind.\u2019 (At this) the ear\nentered (the body).\nV-i-11: The mind departed. Staying a year out, it came back and asked, \u2018How have you been able to\nlive without me ?\u2019 (The others replied,) \u2018Just like infants without developed minds, yet living with the\nbreath, speaking with the organ of speech, seeing with the eye and hearing with the ear.\u2019 (At this) the\nmind entered (the body).\nV-i-12: Then, as the Prana was about to depart, it uprooted the other senses just as a horse of mettle\nwould uproot the pegs to which it is tethered. They all then came to it and said, \u2018O revered sir, be our\nlord, you are the best amongst us; do not depart from the body.\u2019\nV-i-13: Then speech said to that one, \u2018Just as I am the richest, in the same manner are you also the\nrichest\u2019. Then the eye said to that one, \u2018Just as I am the stable basis, in the same manner are you also\nthe stable basis\u2019.\nV-i-14: Then the ear said to that one, \u2018Just as I am prosperity, in the same manner are you also\nprosperity.\u2019 Then the mind said to that one, \u2018Just as I am the abode, in the same manner are you also the\nabode.\u2019\nV-i-15: Verily, people do not call them as organs of speech, nor as eyes, nor as ears, nor as minds. But\nthey call them only as Pranas; for the Prana indeed is all these.\n\nV-ii-1: He (the Prana) asked, \u2018What will be my food?\u2019 \u2018Whatever there is here, even (the food) of dogs\nand birds\u2019, replied the senses. Whatever is eaten, all that is the food of Ana. The name \"Ana\u2019 indeed is\nself-evident. For him who knows thus there is nothing that is not food.\nV-ii-2: He asked, \u2018What will be my garments ?\u2019 \u2018Water\u2019, replied the senses. Therefore, indeed, those\nwho are about to eat, cover it, both before and after, with water. (He who knows thus) becomes the\nobtainer of clothes and of upper garments.\nV-ii-3: Satyakama Jabala imparted this (doctrine of Prana) to Gosruti, the son of Vyaghrapada, and said,\n\u2018If anyone should impart this even to a dry stump, then branches would certainly shoot and leaves\nwould sprout from it\u2019.\nV-ii-4: Next, if that knower of Prana desires to attain greatness, then having consecrated himself on the\nnew moon day, he should, on the full moon night, stir up in a vessel of curd and honey the mash of all\nherbs and then offer an oblation into the fire on the spot prescribed for offerings, with the Mantra,\n\u2018Svaha to the eldest and the best\u2019, and throw what remains attached to the ladle into the mash-pot.\nV-ii-5: With the Mantra \"Svaha to the richest\u2019, he should offer an oblation into the fire on the spot\nprescribed for offerings, and throw what remains attached to the ladle into the mash-pot. With the\nMantra \u2018Svaha to what is stable\u2019, he should offer an oblation into the fire on the spot prescribed for\nofferings, and throw what remains attached to the ladle into the mash-pot. With Mantra \u2018Svaha to\nprosperity\u2019, he should offer an oblation into the fire on the spot prescribed for offerings, and throw\nwhat remains attached to the ladle into the mash-pot. With the Mantra \u2018Svaha to the abode\u2019, he should\noffer an oblation into the fire on the spot prescribed for offerings, and throw what remains attached to\nthe ladle into the mash-pot.\nV-ii-6: Then, moving a little away and taking the mash-pot in his hands, he should recite (the Mantra):\n\u2018You are Ama by name, for all this (universe) rests with you. He (i.e. you as Prana) is the eldest, the\nbest, the effulgent, and sovereign. May he (i.e. you as Prana) lead me to the eldest age, to the best\nposition, to effulgence, and to sovereignty. Verily I wish to become all this.\u2019\nV-ii-7: Then, reciting this Rik-mantra, foot by foot, he should sip. \u2018We pray for that food pertaining to\nthe Progenitor\u2019, saying this (line) he should sip. \u2018We pray for the food of the effulgent one\u2019, saying this\nhe should sip. \u2018(Which is) the best and all-sustaining\u2019, saying this he should sip. We readily meditate\nupon (the form of the deity) Bhaga\u2019, saying this and washing the pot shaped like a Kamsa (goblet) or a\nCamasa (cup), he should drink all. Then he should lie down behind the fire on a skin or on the ground,\ncontrolling speech and mind. If he should see a woman (in a dream), he should know that his rite has\nsucceeded.\nV-ii-8: There is this verse about it: During the performance of the rites for desired results if the\nperformer sees a woman in a dream, then he should recognize fulfilment in this vision in a dream \u2013 yea,\nin this vision in a dream.\nV-iii-1: Once Svetaketu, the grandson of Aruna, came to the assembly of the Panchalas. Pravahana, the\nson of Jivala, enquired of him, \u2018My boy, has your father instructed you ?\u2019 \u2018He has indeed, revered sir\u2019.\nV-iii-2: \u2018Do you know where created beings go above from here ?\u2019 No, revered sir\u2019. \u2018Do you know the\nplace of parting of the two paths \u2013 the path of the gods and the path of the fathers ?\u2019 \u2018No, revered sir\u2019.\nV-iii-3: \u2018Do you know why the other world is not filled up ?\u2019 \u2018No, revered sir\u2019. \u2018Do you know how, at\nthe fifth oblation, the liquid oblations (or unseen results of action) come to be designated as man ?\u2019\n\u2018No, indeed, revered sir\u2019.\nV-iii-4: \u2019Then why did you say, \"I have been instructed\" ? Foz, how can he who does not know these\nthings say, \"I have been instructed\" ?\u2019 He was distressed and came to his father\u2019s place and said to him,\n\u2018Revered Sir, wiuhout having instructed me properly you said, \"I have instructed you\".\u2019\nV-iii-5: \u2018That nominal Kshatriya asked me five questions, and I was not able to answer even one of\nthem\u2019. The father said, \u2018Even as you have spoken to me about them, so do I not know even one of\nthem. If I had known them, why should I not have toll you ?\u2019\n\nV-iii-6: Then Gautama went to the king\u2019s place. When he arrived, the king made reverential offerings to\nhim. In the morning he presented himself to the king when he was in the assembly. The king said to\nhim, \u2018O revered Gautama, please ask for a boon of human wealth\u2019. He replied, \u2018O king, let the human\nwealth remain with you, tell me those words which you spoke to my boy\u2019. The king was perturbed.\nV-iii-7: The king commanded him, \u2018Stay here for a long time.\u2019 At the end of the period he said to him,\n\u2018Even as you told me, O Gautama, prior to you, this knowledge never went to the Brahmanas. This is\nwhy the expounding of this knowledge belonged to the Kshatriyas in earlier times in all the worlds\u2019.\nThen he instructed him.\nV-iv-1: The world yonder is indeed the fire, O Gautama. Of that, the sun is the fuel, the rays are the\nsmoke, the day is the flame, the moon is the embers, and the stars are the sparks.\nV-iv-2: Into this fire the deities offer the oblation of faith. Out of that oblation King Soma arises.\nV-v-1: Parjanya is indeed the fire, O Gautama. Of that, the air is the fuel, the cloud is the smoke, the\nlightning is the flame, the thunderbolt is the embers, and the rumblings of thunder are the sparks.\nV-v-2: Into this fire the deities offer the oblation of King Soma. Out of that oblation rain arises.\nV-vi-1: The earth indeed is the fire, O Gautama. Of that, the year, is the fuel, Akasa is the smgke, night\nis the flame, the directions are the embers, and the intermediate directions are the sparks.\nV-vi-2: Into this fire the deities offer the oblation of rain. Out of that oblation food (in the shape of\ncorn) arises.\nV-vii-1: Man indeed is the fire, O Gautama. Of that, speech is the fuel, Prana is the smoke, the tongue\nis the flame, the eye is the embers, and the ear is the sparks.\nV-vii-2: Into this fire the deities offer the oblation of food. Out of that oblation the seed arises.\nV-viii-1-2: Woman indeed is the fire, O Gautama. Into this fire the deities offer the oblation of the seed.\nOut of that oblation the foetus arises.\nV-ix-1: Thus at the fifth oblation, (the oblation called) water comes to be designated as man. That\nfoetus, covered with membrane, lies for nine or ten months, and is then born.\nV-ix-2: Being born, he lives whatever the length of his life may be. When he is dead (to attain the\nworld) as ordained, they carry him from here (for cremation) to fire itself from which alone he came\nand from which he arose.\nV-x-1-2: Among them, those who know thus (this knowledge of the five fires) and those who are\ndevoted to faith and austerity in the forest \u2013 they go to light; from light to the day, from the day to the\nbright fortnight, from the bright fortnight to those six months during which the sun travels northward;\nfrom the months to the year, from the year to the sun, from the sun to the moon and from the moon to\nthe lightning. (From the region of Brahman) a person, who is other than human, (comes and) causes\nthem, existing there, to attain Brahman. This is the path of the gods.\nV-x-3: But those who living in villages (as householders) practise sacrifices and works of public utility\nand gift, go to smoke, from smoke to night, from night to the dark fortnight, from the dark fortnight to\nthose months during which the sun travels southward. From there they do not reach the year (like those\ngoing the path of the gods).\nV-x-4: From the months, (they go) to the region of the fathers, from the region of the fathers to Akasa,\nfrom Akasa to the moon. This (i.e. this moon) is King Soma (the king of the Brahmanas). This is the\nfood of the deities. This the deities eat.\nV-x-5: Residing in that (region of the moon) till they have exhausted (the results of action) they then\nreturn again the same way as they came (by the path that is being mentioned). They come to Akasa, and\nfrom Akasa to air. Having become air, they become smoke. Having become smoke they become the\n\nwhite cloud.\nV-x-6: Having become the white cloud, they become the (rain-bearing) cloud. Having become the\ncloud they fall as rain. Then they are born in this world as rice and barley, herbs and trees, sesamum\nplants and beans. But the release from these is more difficult, for whoever eats the food and sows the\nseed, they become like him only.\nV-x-7: Among them, those who have good residual results of action here (earned in this world and left\nas residue after the enjoyment in the region of the moon), quickly reach a good womb, the womb of a\nBrahmana, or of a Kshatriya or of a Vaisya. But those who have bad residual results of action quickly\nreach an evil womb, the womb of a dog or of a hog or of a Chandala.\nV-x-8: Then, by neither of these two paths, do they go. They, as small creatures, keep repeatedly\nrevolving, subject to the saying \u2018Be born and die\u2019. This is the third state. Therefore that region (of the\nmoon) is never filled up. Hence one should be disgusted (with this state). There is this verse about it.\nV-x-9: One who steals gold, one who drinks wine, one who dishonours the teacher\u2019s bed, and one who\ninjures a Brahmana \u2013 all these four fall, as also the fifth one who associates with them.\nV-x-10: Moreover, he who knows (worships) these five fires thus, even though he associates with those\nsinners, is not tainted by sin. He who knows these thus becomes cleansed and pure and obtains the\nmeritorious world \u2013 yea, he who knows thus.\nV-xi-1: Pracinasala the son of Upamanyu, Satyayajna the son of Pulusa, Indradyumna the son of\nBhallavi, Jana the son of Sarkaraksa, and Budila the son of Asvatarasva \u2013 these five great householders\nand great Vedic scholars, having come together, held a discussion on \u2018What is our Atman ? What is\nBrahman ?\u2019\nV-xi-2: They reflected among themselves, \u2018Revered sirs, Uddalaka, the son of Aruna, knows well this\nVaisvanara Atman. Well, let us go to him\u2019. And they went to him.\nV-xi-3: Uddalaka reflected, \u2018These great householders and great Vedic scholars are going to uestion\nme; but possibly I shall not be able to tell them everything. However, I shall direct them to another\nteacher\u2019.\nV-xi-4: Uddalaka said to the, \u2018Revered sirs, at present, Asvapati, the son of Kekaya, is studying this\nVaisvanara Atman. Well, let us go to him\u2019. Then they went to him.\nV-xi-5: When they arrived, the king arranged for each of them separately a welcome with suitable rites.\nNext morning, on rising, he said to them, \u2018In my kingdom there is no thief, no miser, no drunkard, no\nman who has not installed the fire, no ignorant person, no adulterer, so how can there be any\nadulteress ? Revered sirs, I am going to perform a sacrifice. In that as much wealth, sirs, as I give to\neach single priest, shall I give to you also. Revered sirs, please remain\u2019.\nV-xi-6: They said, \u2018The purpose for which a man goes (to another), on that alone he should speak to\nhim. You are, at present, studying the Vaisvanara Atman, please tell us of that.\nV-xi-7: The king said to them, \u2018I shall answer you in the morning\u2019. In the morning, they approached\nhim with sacrificial fuel in their hands. The king, without receiving them as initiated pupils, spoke thus:\nV-xii-1: \u2018O Aupamanyava, what is the Atman on which you meditate ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018Heaven only, O\nvenerable king\u2019. The king said, \u2018This that you meditate upon as Atman is the Vaisvanara Atman known\nas \"the highly luminous\". Therefore in your family are seen the Suta, Prasuta and Asuta libations of\nSoma-juice.\u2019\nV-xii-2: \u2018So you eat food and see what is dear. One who meditates on this Vaisvanara Atman thus, eats\nfood and sees what is dear, and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom. But\nthis is only the head of the Atman. If you had not come to me your head (a portion) would have fallen\ndown.\u2019\nV-xiii-1: Then the king said to Satyayajna Paulusi, \u2018O Pracinayogya, what is that Atman on which you\nmeditate ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018The sun only, O venerable king\u2019. The king said, \u2018This that you meditate upon\n\nas Atman is the Vaisvanara Atman known as \"the multiform\". Therefore in your family are seen all\nkinds of enjoyable things.\nV-xiii-2: \u2018So, for you are provided a chariot drawn by mules, maid-servants and a gold necklace; so you\neat food and see what is dear. One who thus meditates upon this Vaisvanara Atman, eats food and sees\nwhat is dear, and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom. But this is only the\neye of the Atman. If you had not come to me you would have become blind.\u2019\nV-xiv-1: Then the king said to Indradyumna Bhallaveya, \u2018O descendant of Vyaghrapada, what is that\nAtman on which you meditate ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018Air only, O venerable king.\u2019 The king said, \u2018This that you\nmeditate upon as Atman is the Vaisvanara Atman known as \"the diversely coursed\". Therefore from\ndiverse directions offerings come to you, and various rows of chariots follow you.\nV-xiv-2: \u2018So you eat food and see what is dear. One who thus meditates upon this Vaisvanara Atman\neats food and sees what is dear, and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom.\nBut this is only the Prana of the Atman. If you had not come to me your Prana would have departed\u2019.\nV-xv-1: Then the king said to Jana, \u2018O Sarkaraksya, what is that Atman on which you meditate ?\u2019 He\nreplied, \u2018Akasa only, O venerable king\u2019. The king said, \u2018This that you meditate upon as Atman is the\nVaisvanara Atman known as \"the manifold\". Therefore are your offspring and wealth manifold.\nV-xv-2: \u2018So you eat food and see what is dear. One who thus meditates upon this Vaisvanara Atman,\neats food and sees what is dear, and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom.\nBut this is only the trunk of the Atman. If you had not come to me your trunk would have been\nshattered\u2019.\nV-xvi-1: Then the king said to Budila Asvatarasvi, \u2018O Vaiyaghrapadya, what is that Atman on which\nyou meditate ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018Water only, O venerable king\u2019. The king said, \u2018This that you meditate upon\nas Atman is the Vaisvanara Atman known as \"the wealth\". Therefore are you endowed with wealth and\nbodily strength.\nV-xvi-2: \u2018So you eat food and see what is dear. One who thus meditates upon this Vaisvanara Atman,\neats food and sees what is dear, and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom.\nBut this is only the lower belly of the Atman. If you had not come to me your lower belly would have\nburst\u2019.\nV-xvii-1: Then the king said to Uddalaka Aruni, \u2018O Gautama, what is that Atman on which you\nmeditate ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018The earth only, O venerable king\u2019. The king said, \u2018This that you meditate upon\nas Atman is the Vaisvanara Atman known as \"the foundation\". Therefore are you well-founded in\noffspring and cattle\u2019.\nV-xvii-2: \u2018So you eat food and see what is dear. One who thus meditates upon this Vaisvanara Atman,\neats food and sees what is dear, and there is in his family the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom.\nBut this is only the feet of the Atman. If you had not come to me your feet would have withered away\u2019.\nV-xviii-1: The king said to them, \u2018All of you (with partial knowledge) eat food knowing the Vaisvanara\nAtman differently, as it were. But one who thus meditates upon this Vaisvanara Atman as a whole,\nconsisting of parts and self-conscious, eats food in all the worlds, in all the beings, and in all the selves.\nV-xviii-2: Of the aforesaid Vaisvanara Atman, the head is \u2018the highly luminous\u2019, the eye is \u2018the\nmultiform\u2019, the breath is \u2018the diversely coursed\u2019, the trunk is \u2018the vast\u2019, the lower belly is the \u2018wealth\u2019,\nthe feet are the earth (\u2018the foundation\u2019). (Of the enjoyer as Vaisvanara) the chest is the altar, the hairs on\nthe chest are the Kusa grass, the heart is the Garhapatya fire, the mind is the Anvaharyapacana fire, and\nthe mouth is the Ahavaniya fire.\nV-xix-1: Therefore, the food that comes first should be an object of oblation. That eater, when he offers\n\nthe first oblation, should offer it with the Mantra \u2018Svaha to Prana\u2019; thereby Prana is satisfied.\nV-xix-2: Prana being satisfied, the eye is satisfied; the eye being satisfied, the sun is satisfied; the sun\nbeing satisfied, heaven is satisfied; heaven being satisfied, whatever is under heaven and the sun is\nsatisfied. Through its satisfaction the eater himself is satisfied. (He is satisfied) also with offspring,\ncattle, food, lustre and the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom.\nV-xx-1: Then, when he offers the second oblation, he should offer it with the Mantra \u2018Svaha to Vyana\u2019;\nthereby Vyana is satisfied.\nV-xx-2: Vyana being satisfied, the ear is satisfied; the ear being satisfied, the moon is satisfied; the\nmoon being satisfied, the quarters are satisfied; the quarters being satisfied, whatever is under the moon\nand the quarters is satisfied. Through its satisfaction the eater himself is satisfied. (He is satisfied) also\nwith offspring, cattle, food, lustre and the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom.\nV-xxi-1: Then, when he offers the third oblation, he should offer it with the Mantra \u2018Svaha to Apana\u2019;\nthereby Apana is satisfied.\nV-xxi-2: Apana being satisfied, speech is satisfied; speech being satisfied, fire is satisfied; fire being\nsatisfied, the earth is satisfied; the earth being satisfied, whatever is under the earth and fire is satisfied.\nThrough its satisfaction the eater himself is satisfied. (He is satisfied) also with offspring, cattle, food,\nlustre and the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom.\nV-xxii-1: Then, when he offers the fourth oblation, he should offer it with the Mantra \u2018Svaha to\nSamana\u2019; thereby Samana is satisfied.\nV-xxii-2: Samana being satisfied, the mind is satisfied; the mind being satisfied, Parjanya (rain god) is\nsatisfied; Parjanya being satisfied, lightning is satisfied; lightning being satisfied, whatever is under\nlightning and Parjanya is satisfied. Through its satisfaction the eater himself is satisfied. (He is\nsatisfied) also with offspring, cattle, food, lustre and the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom.\nV-xxiii-1: Then, when he offers the fifth oblation, he should offer it with the Mantra \u2018Svaha to Udana\u2019;\nthereby Udana is satisfied.\nV-xxiii-2: Udana being satisfied, the skin is satisfied; the skin being satisfied, the air is satisfied; the air\nbeing satisfied, Akasa is satisfied; Akasa being satisfied, whatever is under the air and Akasa is\nsatisfied. Through its satisfaction the eater himself is satisfied. (He is satisfied) also with offspring,\ncattle, food, lustre and the holy effulgence born of sacred wisdom.\nV-xxiv-1: If anyone, without knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, it would be just a man removing the\nlive embers and pouring the oblation on the ashes.\nV-xxiv-2: But if one, knowing it thus, offers the Agnihotra to Prana his oblation is poured into all the\nworlds, all the beings, and all the selves.\nV-xxiv-3: So, even as reed-cotton when laid on the fire is burnt up, so are burnt up all the sins of this\none who knowing it thus offers the Agnihotra.\nV-xxiv-4: Therefore, even if one, who knows thus, offers the remnant of his food to a Chandala, then\nalso that food becomes his offering to the Vaisvanara Atman only. There is this verse about it.\nV-xxiv-5: As, in this world, hungry boys gather round their mother, even so all the creatures wait upon\nthe Agnihotra.\nVI-i-1: Om. Once upon a time there was one Svetaketu, the grandson of Aruna. His father said to him,\n\u2018O Svetaketu, live the life of a Brahmacharin. Dear boy, there never is anyone in our family who does\nnot study and is only nominally a Brahmana.\u2019\nVI-i-2-3: Having gone (to the teacher\u2019s house) when twelve years old, he came back when he was\ntwenty-four old, having studied all the Vedas, conceited, arrogant and regarding himself as very\n\nlearned. His father said to him, \u2018Svetaketu, dear boy, you, I see, are conceited, arrogant, regarding\nyourself as very learned; did you ask for that teaching (about the Supreme Brahman) through which\nwhat is unheard becomes heard, what is unthought becomes thought of, what is unknown becomes\nknown ?\u2019 \u2018Of what nature, revered sir, is that teaching ?\u2019\nVI-i-4: \u2018Dear boy, just as through a single clod of clay all that is made of clay would become known,\nfor all modifications is but name based upon words and the clay alone is real;\nVI-i-5: Dear boy, just as through a single ingot of gold, all that is made of gold would become known,\nfor all modification is but name based upon words and the gold alone is real;\nVI-i-6: Dear boy, just as through a single nail-parer all that is made of iron would become known, for\nall modification is but name based upon words and the iron alone is real \u2013 such, dear boy, is that\nteaching.\u2019\nVI-i-7: \u2018Surely, my revered teachers did not know it, for if they had known, why should they not have\ntold it to me ? However, revered father, teach it to me\u2019. \u2018Be it so, dear boy\u2019, said (the father).\nVI-ii-1: \u2018In the beginning, dear boy, this was Being alone, one only, without a second. Some say that, in\nthe beginning, this was Non-being alone, one only, without a second. From that Non-being arose\nBeing.\u2019\nVI-ii-2: Aruni said, \u2018But now, indeed, dear boy, could it be so ? How could Being arise from Non-being\n? In truth, dear boy, in the beginning (before creation), there was Being alone, one only, without a\nsecond.\nVI-ii-3: \u2018That Being willed, \"May I become many, may I grow forth.\" It created fire. That fire willed,\n\"May I become many, may I grow forth\". It created water. Therefore whenever a man grieves or\nperspires, then it is from fire that water issues.\nVI-ii-4: \u2018That water willed, \"May I become many, may I grow forth.\" It created food. Therefore\nwherever it rains, abundant food grows there; it is from water that food for eating is produced.\nVI-iii-1: \u2018Of the aforesaid beings there are only three origins: those born from eggs, born from living\nbeings, and born from sprouts.\nVI-iii-2: \u2018That deity willed, \u2018Well, let me, entering into these three deities through this living self\n(Jivatman), differentiate name and form.\nVI-iii-3: \"Of these, let me make each one triplicated\", willing thus, this deity entered into these three\ndeities through this living self and differentiated names and forms.\nVI-iii-4: \u2018It made each one of them threefold. But, dear boy, how each of these three deities becomes\nthreefold (outside the body), know that from me.\nVI-iv-1: \u2018In fire, the red colour is the colour of fire; that which is white belongs to water and that which\nis black belongs to food (earth). Thus vanishes (the idea of) the quality of fire from fire; for all\nmodification is but name based upon words, only the three forms are real.\nVI-iv-2: \u2018In the sun, the red colour is the colour of fire, that which is white belongs to water and that\nwhich is black belongs to earth. Thus vanishes (the idea of) the quality of the sun from the sun; for all\nmodification is but name based upon words, only the three forms are real.\nVI-iv-3: \u2018In the moon, the red colour is the colour of fire, that which is white belongs to water and that\nwhich is black belongs to earth. Thus vanishes (the idea of) the quality of the moon from the moon; for\nall modification is but name based upon words, only the three forms are real.\nVI-iv-4: \u2018In lightning, the red colour is the colour of fire, that which is white belongs to water and that\nwhich is black belongs to earth. Thus vanishes (the idea of) the quality of lightning from lightning; for\nall modification is but name based upon words, only the three forms are real.\nVI-iv-5: \u2018It was indeed on knowing this (triplication) that the ancient great householders and great\nVedic scholars said, \u2018There is, at present, nothing that anyone would point out to us as unheard,\nunthought or unknown\"; for from these they understood everything.\n\nVI-iv-6: \u2018Whatever else appeared red, that also they knew to be the colour of (untriplicated) fire;\nwhatever appeared white, that also they knew to be the colour of water; whatever appeared black, that\nalso they knew to be the colour of earth.\nVI-iv-7: \u2018Whatever appeared to be unknown, that also they knew to be a combination of these very\ndeities. But, dear boy, know from me how, on reaching man, each of these three deities becomes\nthreefold.\nVI-v-1: \u2018Food, when eaten, becomes divided into three parts. What is its grossest ingredient, that\nbecomes faeces; what is the middling ingredient, that becomes flesh; and what is the subtlest\ningredient, that becomes mind.\nVI-v-2: \u2018Water, when drunk, becomes divided into three parts. What is its grossest ingredient, that\nbecomes urine; what is the middling ingredient, that becomes blood; and what is the subtlest ingredient,\nthat becomes Prana.\nVI-v-3: \u2018Fire, when eaten, becomes divided into three parts. What is its grossest ingredient, that\nbecomes bone; what is the middling ingredient, that becomes marrow; and what is the subtlest\ningredient, hat becomes speech.\nVI-v-4: \u2018Hence, dear boy, mind is made up of food, Prana is made up of water, and speech is made of\nfire. \u2018Explain it further to me, revered sir\u2019. \u2018Be it so, dear boy\u2019, said the father.\nVI-vi-1: \u2018Dear boy, of the curd that is being churned that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and\nthat becomes butter.\nVI-vi-2: \u2018So also, dear boy, of the food that is eaten that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and\nthat becomes the mind.\nVI-vi-3: \u2018Dear boy, of the water that is drunk that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and that\nbecomes Prana.\nVI-vi-4: \u2018Dear boy, of the fire that is eaten that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and that\nbecomes speech.\nVI-vi-5: \u2018Hence, dear boy, mind is made up of food, Prana is made up of water, and speech is made up\nof fire\u2019. \u2018Explain it further to me, revered sir\u2019. \u2018Be it so, dear boy\u2019, said the father.\nVI-vii-1: \u2018Dear boy, man consists of sixteen parts. Do not eat for fifteen days; drink as much water as\nyou like. Prana is made up of water, and the Prana of one who drinks water is not cut off.\nVI-vii-2: Svetaketu did not eat for fifteen days. Then he approached him saying, \u2018What shall I say ?\u2019\nThe father said, \u2018The Riks, the Yajus, and the Samans, dear boy.\u2019 \u2018They do not at all arise in me, sir\u2019.\nVI-vii-3: The father said to him, \u2018Dear boy, just as a single ember of the size of a firefly, left over from\na large burning fire, cannot burn any more than that, even so, dear boy, of your sixteen parts only one\npart is left over, now by means of that you cannot perceive the Vedas. Eat, then you will understand\nme\u2019.\nVI-vii-4: He ate and then approached his father. Whatever he asked him, he answered them all.\nVI-vii-5-6: The father said to him, \u2018Dear boy, just as when a single ember of the size of a firefly left\nover from a large burning fire, is made to blaze up by adding straw and it burns much more than before,\neven so, dear boy, of your sixteen parts, only one part remained, and that being nourished by food, has\nbeen made to blaze up; and by that you perceive the Vedas now. Hence, dear boy, the mind is made up\nof food, the Prana is made up of water, and speech is made up of fire. From his words, (Svetaketu)\nunderstood it \u2013 yea, he understood it.\nVI-viii-1: Once Uddalaka Aruni said to his son Svetaketu, \u2018Dear boy, know from me the true nature of\nsleep. When a man is said to be sleeping, then, dear boy, he has become united with Being and has\nattained his own nature. Hence people speak of him as sleeping, for them he has attained his own\nnature.\n\nVI-viii-2: \u2018Just as a bird tied to a string, after flying in various directions and finding no resting place\nelsewhere, takes refuge at the very place where to it is tied, even so, dear boy, that mind, after flying in\nvarious directions and finding no resting place elsewhere, takes refuge in Prana alone; for the mind,\ndear boy, is tied to Prana.\nVI-viii-3: \u2018Dear boy, know from me (the true nature of) hunger and thirst. When a man is said to be\nhungry, then (it is to be understood that), water is leading away what has been eaten; (therefore water\nmay be designated as hunger). Just as people speak of the leader of cows, the leader of horses, and the\nleader of men, even so they speak of water as the leader of food. Hence, dear boy, know this shoot (the\nbody) to be put forth (by a root), for it cannot be without a root.\nVI-viii-4: \u2018Where could its root be apart from food ? Even so, dear boy, with food as the shoot, look for\nwater as the root; with water as the shoot, dear boy, look for fire as the root; with fire as the shoot, dear\nboy, look for Being as the root. All these creatures, dear boy, have Being as their root, have Being as\ntheir abode, and have Being as their support.\nVI-viii-5: \u2018Again, when a man is said to be thirsty, then (it is to be understood that), fire is leading\naway what has been drunk: (therefore fire may be designated as thirst). Just as people speak of the\nleader of cows, the leader of horses, and the leader of men, even so they speak of that fire as the leader\nof water. Hence, dear boy, know this shoot (water) to be put forth (by a root), for it cannot be without a\nroot.\nVI-viii-6: \u2018Where could its root be apart from water ? Dear boy, with water as the shoot, look for fire as\nthe root; with fire as the shoot, look for Being as the root. All these creatures, dear boy, have Being as\ntheir root, have Being as their abode, and have Being as their support. How dear boy, each of these\nthree deities, on reaching man, becomes threefold has been explained to you earlier. When this man is\nabout to depart, dear boy, his speech merges in the mind, mind in Prana, Prana in fire and fire in the\nsupreme deity.\nVI-viii-7: \u2018That Being which is this subtle essence (cause), even That all this world has for its self. That\nis the true. That is the Atman. That thou art, O Svetaketu.\u2019 \u2018Revered sir, please explain it further to me\u2019.\n\u2018So be it, dear boy\u2019, said (the father).\nVI-ix-1-2: \u2018As, dear boy, the bees make honey by collecting juices from different trees and reduce them\ninto one essence, and there, as these juices have no such discrimination as \"I am the juice of this tree, I\nam the juice of that tree\"; even so, dear boy, all these creatures having merged into Being, do not know,\n\"We have merged into Being.\"\nVI-ix-3: \u2018Whatever these creatures are here, tiger or lion or wolf or boar or worm or flying insect or\ngad-fly or mosquito, that they become again.\nVI-ix-4: \u2018That Being which is this subtle essence (cause), even That all this world has for its self. That\nis the true. That is the Atman. That thou art, O Svetaketu.\u2019 \u2018Revered sir, please explain it further to me\u2019.\n\u2018So be it, dear boy\u2019, said (the father).\nVI-x-1-2: \u2018These eastern rivers, dear boy, flow along to the east and the western ones to the west. They\nrise from the ocean and merge in the ocean, and become that ocean itself. And there as these rivers do\nnot know themselves as \"I am this river, I am that river\", even so, dear boy, all these creatures, having\ncome from Being, do not know, \"We have come from Being\". And whatever these creatures were here,\ntiger or lion or wolf or boar or worm or flying insect or gad-fly or mosquito, that they become again.\nVI-x-3: \u2018That Being which is this subtle essence (cause), even That all this world has for its self. That is\nthe true. That is the Atman. That thou art, O Svetaketu.\u2019 \u2018Revered sir, please explain it further to me\u2019.\n\u2018So be it, dear boy\u2019, said (the father).\nVI-xi-1: \u2018Of this large tree, dear boy, if anyone were to strike at the root, it would exude sap, though\nstill living; if anyone were to strike in the middle, it would exude sap, though still living; if anyone\nwere to strike at the top, it would exude sap, though still living. As that tree is pervaded by the living\n\nself, it stands firm, drinking constantly and rejoicing.\nVI-xi-2: \u2018If the life leaves one branch of this tree, then that branch dries up; if it leaves the second one,\nthen that dries up; it leaves the whole tree, the whole tree dries up.\u2019\nVI-xi-3: The father said, \u2018Dear boy, know that even so, being left by the living self this body surely\ndies, but the living self does not die. That Being which is this subtle essence (cause), even That all this\nworld has for its self. That is the true. That is the Atman. That thou art, O Svetaketu.\u2019 \u2018Revered sir,\nplease explain it further to me\u2019. \u2018So be it, dear boy\u2019, said (the father).\nVI-xii-1: \u2018Bring a fruit from this Banyan tree\u2019. \u2018Here it is, revered sir\u2019. \u2018Break it.\u2019 \u2018It is broken, revered\nsir\u2019. \u2018What do you see in this ?\u2019 \u2018These seeds, small like particles, revered sir\u2019. \u2018Break one of these, my\nchild\u2019. \u2018It is broken, revered sir\u2019. \u2018What do you see in it ?\u2019 \u2018Nothing, revered sir\u2019.\nVI-xii-2: The father said to him, \u2018Dear boy, this subtle essence which you do not perceive, growing\nfrom this subtle essence the large Banyan tree thus stands. Have faith, dear boy.\u2019\nVI-xii-3: \u2018That Being which is this subtle essence (cause), even That all this world has for its self. That\nis the true. That is the Atman. That thou art, O Svetaketu.\u2019 \u2018Revered sir, please explain it further to me\u2019.\n\u2018So be it, dear boy\u2019, said (the father).\nVI-xiii-1-2: \u2018Put this salt into water and then come to me in the morning\u2019. He did so. The father said to\nhim, \u2018Bring the salt, my child, which you put into water at night\u2019. Having searched for it, he did not\nfind it, as it has completely dissolved. \u2018My child, take a sip from the top of this water. How is it?\u2019 \u2018It is\nsalt\u2019. \u2018Take a sip from the middle. How is it ?\u2019 \u2018It is salt\u2019. \u2018Take a sip from the bottom. How is it ?\u2019 \u2018It is\nsalt\u2019. \u2018Throw this water away and then come to me\u2019. He did so (and returned saying), \u2018It is there\nalways\u2019. The father said to him, \u2018Dear boy, as you do not see what is present in this water though\nindeed it exists in it, similarly, (Being exists) indeed in this body.\nVI-xiii-3: \u2018That Being which is this subtle essence (cause), even That all this world has for its self. That\nis the true. That is the Atman. That thou art, O Svetaketu.\u2019 \u2018Revered sir, please explain it further to me\u2019.\n\u2018So be it, dear boy\u2019, said (the father).\nVI-xiv-1: \u2018Just as, dear boy, (some robber) having brought a man from the Gandhara region with his\neyes bound up, might leave him in a very desolate place, and just as that man would shout towards the\neast, or towards the north, or towards the south, or towards the west, (saying) \"I have been brought here\nwith my eyes bound up, I have been left here with my eyes bound up.\"\u2019\nVI-xiv-2: \u2018And as some one might remove his bandage and tell him, \"The Gandhara region is in this\ndirection, proceed in this direction\" and as he, enquiring his way from village, to village and being\ninstructed and capable of judging by himself would reach the Gandhara region itself, even so, in this\nworld that person knows who has a preceptor. And for him, only so long is the delay as he is not\nliberated (from the body) and then immediately he is merged in Being.\nVI-xiv-3: \u2018That Being which is this subtle essence (cause), even That all this world has for its self. That\nis the true. That is the Atman. That thou art, O Svetaketu.\u2019 \u2018Revered sir, please explain it further to me\u2019.\n\u2018So be it, dear boy\u2019, said (the father).\nVI-xv-1: \u2018Dear boy, the relatives of a man who is ill assemble round him and ask, \"Do you recognise\nme ? Do you recognise me ?\" As long as his speech is not merged in the mind, the mind in Prana, Prana\nin fire, and fire in the supreme deity, so long does he know them.\nVI-xv-2: \u2018Then when his speech is merged in the mind, the mind in Prana, Prana in fire, and fire in the\nsupreme deity, then he does not know them.\nVI-xv-3: \u2018That Being which is this subtle essence (cause), even That all this world has for its self. That\nis the true. That is the Atman. That thou art, O Svetaketu.\u2019 \u2018Revered sir, please explain it further to me\u2019.\n\u2018So be it, dear boy\u2019, said (the father).\n\nVI-xvi-1: \u2018Dear boy, (The officers of the king) bring a man, holding him by the hand (while saying)\n\"He has taken something, he has committed a theft, heat the axe for him\". If he is doer of that, then he\nmakes himself false. And being addicted to falsehood, he covers himself with falsehood and grasps the\nheated axe; he is burnt, and then he is punished.\nVI-xvi-2: \u2018If, however, he is not the doer of that, then he makes himself true. And being attached to\ntruth, he covers himself with truth and grasps the heated axe; he is not burnt and then he is released.\nVI-xvi-3: \u2018And as in this case he (the man attached to truth) is not burnt, (similarly a man of knowledge\nis not born again). Thus has all this world That for its self. That is the true. That is the Atman. That thou\nart, O Svetaketu.\u2019 From his words Svetaketu understood That \u2013 yea, he understood.\nVII-i-1: Om. \u2018Revered sir, teach me,\u2019 thus saying Narada approached Sanatkumara. Sanatkumara said\nto him, \u2018What you already know, declaring that to me, be my disciple. What is beyond that I shall tell\nyou.\u2019 Narada said:\nVII-i-2: \u2018Revered sir, I know the Rig-Veda, the Yajur-Veda, the Sama-Veda and the Atharvanas the\nfourth, the Itihasa-Purana as the fifth, grammar, the rules for the worship of the ancestors, mathematics,\nthe science of portents, the science of treasures, logic, the science of ethics, etymology, the ancillary\nknowledge of the Vedas, the physical sciences, the science of war, the science of the stars, the science\nrelated to serpents, and the fine arts \u2013 all this I know, revered sir.\u2019\nVII-i-3: \u2018Revered sir, however, I am only a knower of verbal texts, not a knower of Atman. Indeed I\nhave heard from persons like your revered self that a knower of Atman goes beyond grief. I am in such\na state of grief. May your revered self take me across it.\u2019 Sanatkumara replied to him,\u2019 Whatsoever you\nhave studied here, really it is only a name.\u2019\nVII-i-4: \u2018Name indeed is Rig-Veda, (so also) Yajur-Veda, Sama-Veda and the Atharvana as the fourth,\nthe Itihasa-Purana as the fifth, grammar, the rules of the worship of the ancestors, mathematics, the\nscience of portents, the science of treasures, logic, the science of ethics, etymology, the ancillary\nknowledge of the Vedas, the physical science, the science of war, the science of the stars, the science\nrelated to serpents, and the fine arts \u2013 name alone is all this. Worship the name.\nVII-i-5: \u2018He who worships name as Brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the\nreach of name, he who worships name as Brahman\u2019. (Narada) \u2018Revered sir, is there anything greater\nthan name ?\u2019 (Sanatkumara) \u2018Surely, there is something greater than name\u2019. (Narada) \u2018Revered sir,\ncommunicate it to me.\u2019\nVII-ii-1: \u2018Speech surely is greater than name. Speech indeed makes us understand the Rig-Veda, YajurVeda, Sama-Veda, Atharvana as the fourth, Itihasa-Purana as the fifth, grammar, the rules of the\nworship of the ancestors, mathematics, the science of portents, the science of treasures, logic, the\nscience of ethics, etymology, the ancillary knowledge of the Vedas, the physical science, the science of\nwar, the science of the stars, the science related to serpents, and the fine arts \u2013 also heaven and earth,\nair and Akasa, water and fire, gods and men, cattle and birds, grasses and trees, beasts down to worms,\nflying insects and ants, merit and demerit, true and false, good and bad, pleasant and unpleasant. Verily,\nif speech did not exist, neither merit nor demerit would be understood, neither true nor false, neither\ngood nor bad, neither pleasant nor unpleasant. Speech alone makes us understand all this. (Hence)\nworship speech.\nVII-ii-2: \u2018He who worships speech as Brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within\nthe reach of speech, he who worships speech as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there anything greater than\nspeech ?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there is something greater than speech\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, communicate it to me\u2019.\nVII-iii-1: \u2018Mind surely is greater than speech. Just as the closed hand encompasses two Amalaka, or\ntwo Kola, or two Aksa fruits, so does the mind encompasses speech and name. When by mind one\nintends \"Let me learn the Mantras\", then he learns; Let me do sacrificial acts\", then he does; \"Let me\ndesire offspring and cattle\", then he desires; \"Let me desire this world and the next\", then he desires.\n\nMind indeed is Atman. Mind indeed is the world. Mind indeed is Brahman. Worship the mind.\nVII-iii-2: \u2018He who worships the mind as Brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within\nthe reach of mind, he who worships the mind as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there anything greater than\nmind?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there is something greater than mind\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, communicate it to me\u2019.\nVII-iv-1: \u2018Will surely is greater than mind. Verily, when one wills, then he intends in his mind, then he\nsends forth speech, and he sends it forth in a name. In the name sacred formulas and in sacred formulas\nthe sacrifices become one.\u2019\nVII-iv-2: \u2018All these, indeed, merge in the will, are made up of the will, and abide in the will. Heaven\nand earth willed, air and Akasa willed, water and fire willed. Through the willing of these, rain wills.\nThrough the willing of rain, food wills. Through the willing of food, Pranas will. Through the willing\nof Pranas, sacred formulas will. Through the willing of sacred formulas (sacrificial) acts will. Through\nthe willing of (sacrificial) acts, the world wills. Through the willing of the world, all things will. This is\nwill. Worship will.\nVII-iv-3: \u2018He who worships will as Brahman, he indeed, attains the worlds willed by him \u2013 himself\nbeing permanent, the permanent worlds; himself being well-founded, the well-founded worlds; himself\nbeing undistressed, the undistressed world. He becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the\nreach of will, he who worships will as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there anything greater than will ?\u2019\n\u2018Surely, there is something greater than will\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, communicate it to me\u2019.\nVII-v-1: \u2018Intelligence surely is greater than will. Verily, when one understands, then he wills, then he\nintends in mind, then he sends forth speech, and he sends it forth in a name. In the name sacred\nformulas and in sacred formulas the sacrificed become one.\nVII-v-2: \u2018All these, indeed, merge in intelligence, are made up of intelligence and abide in intelligence.\nTherefore, even if a man who knows much is without intelligence, people speak of him thus, \u2018He does\nnot exist, nor what he has known; if he were really learned, he would not thus be without intelligence\".\nOn the other hand, if a man knowing little is endowed with intelligence, people desire to listen to him\nalso. Intelligence, indeed, is the one centre of mergence of all these, intelligence is their soul, and\nintelligence is their support. Worship intelligence.\nVII-v-3: \u2018He who worships intelligence as Brahman, he indeed, attains the worlds of intelligence \u2013\nhimself being permanent, the permanent worlds; himself being well-established, the well-established\nworlds; and himself being undistressed, the undistressed world. He becomes free to act as he wishes in\nthe sphere within the reach of intelligence, he who worships intelligence as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is\nthere anything greater than intelligence ?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there is something greater than intelligence\u2019.\n\u2018Revered sir, communicate it to me\u2019.\nVII-vi-1: \u2018Contemplation surely is greater than intelligence. The earth contemplates as it were. The sky\ncontemplates as it were. Heaven contemplates as it were. Water contemplates as it were. The mountains\ncontemplate as it were. Gods and men contemplate as it were. Therefore, verily, those who attain\ngreatness among men here, they seem to have obtained a share of the result of contemplation. And\nthose who are small people, they are quarrelsome, abusive and slanderous; but those who are great\nmen, they appear to have obtained a share of the result of contemplation. Worship contemplation.\nVII-vi-2: \u2018He who worships contemplation as Brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere\nwithin the reach of contemplation, he who worships contemplation as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there\nanything greater than contemplation ?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there is something greater than contemplation\u2019.\n\u2018Revered sir, communicate it to me\u2019.\nVII-vii-1: \u2018Understanding surely is greater than contemplation. By understanding alone one\nunderstands the Rig-Veda, Yajur-Veda, Sama-Veda, Atharvana as the fourth, Itihasa-Purana as the fifth,\ngrammar, the rules for the worship of the ancestors; mathematics, the science of portents, the science of\n\ntreasures, logic, the Vedas, the physical science, the science of war, the science of the stars, the science\nrelated to serpents, and the fine arts \u2013 also heaven and earth, air and Akasa, water and fire, gods and\nmen, cattle and birds, grasses and trees, beasts down to worms, flying insects and ants, merit and\ndemerit, true and false, good and bad, pleasant and unpleasant, food and drink, this world and the next\n\u2013 (all this) one understands by understanding alone. Worship understanding.\nVII-vii-2: \u2018He who worships understanding as Brahman, attains the worlds containing the knowledge\nof the Scriptures and other subjects. He becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach\nof understanding, he who worships understanding as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there anything greater\nthan understanding ?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there is something greater than understanding\u2019. \u2018Revered sir,\ncommunicate it to me\u2019.\nVII-viii-1: \u2018Strength surely is greater than understanding. A single man with strength causes even a\nhundred men with understanding to tremble. When a man becomes strong, then he rises; rising, he\nserves; serving, he approaches nearer; approaching nearer, he sees, hears, reflects, understands, acts and\nrealizes. By strength, indeed, the earth stands; by strength, the sky; by strength, heaven; by strength, the\nmountains; by strength, gods and men; by strength, cattle and birds, grasses and trees, beasts down to\nworms, flying insects and ants; by strength the world stands. Worship strength.\nVII-viii-2: \u2018He who worships strength as Brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere\nwithin the reach of strength, he who worships strength as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there anything\ngreater than strength ?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there is something greater than strength\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, ommunicate it\nto me\u2019.\nVII-ix-1: \u2018Food surely is greater than strength. Therefore, if one does not eat for ten days, even though\nhe might live, yet, verily, he does not see, does not hear, does not reflect, does not act, and does not\nrealize. But with the coming of food, he sees, hears, reflects, understands, acts and realizes. Worship\nfood.\nVII-ix-2: \u2018He who worships food as Brahman, he verily attains the worlds supplied with food and\ndrink. He is free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of food, he who worships food as\nBrahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there anything greater than food ?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there is something greater than\nfood\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, communicate it to me\u2019.\nVII-x-1: \u2018Water surely is greater than food. Therefore, when there is not good rain, living creatures are\nin agony (thinking), \"Food will be scarce\". But when there is good rain, living creatures become joyous\n(thinking), \"Food will abound\". Water, indeed, has assumed all these forms \u2013 this earth, this sky, this\nheaven, these mountains, these gods and men, these cattle and birds, grasses and trees, beasts down to\nworms, flying insects and ants. Water, indeed, has assumed all these forms. Worship water.\nVII-x-2: \u2018He who worships water as Brahman obtains all desires and becomes satisfied. He becomes\nfree to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of water, he who worships water as Brahman\u2019.\n\u2018Revered sir, is there anything greater than water ?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there is something greater than water\u2019.\n\u2018Revered sir, communicate it to me\u2019.\nVII-xi-1: \u2018Fire surely is greater than water. It is this fire that having seized the air warms up the Akasa.\nThen people say, \"It is hot, it is burning hot, it will surely rain\". There, it is fire that shows itself first,\nand then creates water. It is (because of) this fire that thunders roll, along with lightnings flashing\nupwards and across; and so people say, \"Lightning is flashing, it is thundering, it will surely rain\".\nThere, it is fire that shows itself first and then creates water. Worship fire.\nVII-xi-2: \u2018He who worships fire as Brahman, he, being resplendent himself, attains resplendent worlds,\nfull of light and free from darkness. He becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach\nof fire, he who worships fire as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there anything greater than fire ?\u2019 \u2018Surely,\nthere is something greater than fire\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, communicate it to me\u2019.\n\nVII-xii-1: Akasa surely is greater than fire. In Akasa, indeed, exist both the sun and the moon,\nlightning, stars and fire. Through Akasa one calls, through Akasa one hears, through Akasa one hears\nthe response. In Akasa one rejoices, in Akasa one does not rejoice. In Akasa a thing is born, and\ntowards Akasa it grows. Worship Akasa.\nVII-xii-2: \u2018He who worships Akasa as Brahman, he indeed, attains vast worlds full of light, unconfined\nand spacious. He is free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of Akasa, he who worships\nAkasa as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there anything greater than Akasa ?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there is something\ngreater than Akasa\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, communicate it to me\u2019.\nVII-xiii-1: \u2018Memory surely is greater than Akasa. Therefore, even if many persons should assemble and\nif they should have no memory, they surely would not hear any sound, they would not think, they\nwould not know. But surely, should they have memory, then they would hear, then they would think,\nthen they would know. Through memory, indeed, one discerns one\u2019s sons, through memory one\u2019s cattle.\nWorship memory.\nVII-xiii-2: \u2018He who worships memory as Brahman becomes free to act as he wishes in the sphere\nwithin the reach of memory, he who worships memory as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there anything\ngreater than memory ?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there is something greater than memory\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, communicate it\nto me\u2019.\nVII-xiv-1: \u2018Aspiration surely is greater than memory. Kindled by aspiration, (one\u2019s) memory recites the\nhymns, performs rites, desires sons and cattle, desires this world and the next. Worship aspiration.\nVII-xiv-2: \u2018He who worships aspiration as Brahman, by aspiration all his wishes prosper, his prayers\nbecome infallible. He is free to act as he wishes in the sphere within the reach of aspiration, he who\nworships aspiration as Brahman\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, is there anything greater than aspiration ?\u2019 \u2018Surely, there\nis something greater than aspiration\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, communicate it to me\u2019.\nVII-xv-1: \u2018Prana surely is greater than aspiration. Just as the spokes of the wheel are fastened to the\nnave, so is all this fastened to this Prana. Prana moves by Prana, Prana gives Prana and it gives Prana.\nPrana is the father, Prana is the mother, Prana is the brother, Prana is the sister, Prana is the preceptor,\nPrana is the Brahmana.\nVII-xv-2: \u2018If one answers something harsh to his father, mother, brother, sister, preceptor or a\nBrahmana, people say this to him, \"Fie on you ! You are indeed a slayer of your father, you are indeed a\nslayer of your mother, you are indeed a slayer of your brother, you are indeed a slayer of your sister,\nyou are indeed a slayer of your preceptor, you are indeed a slayer of a Brahmana.\"\nVII-xv-3: \u2018On the other hand, when the Prana has departed from them, even if one piles them together,\ndismembers them with a fork and burns them up, surely people would not say to him, \"You are a slayer\nof your father\", nor \"you are a slayer of your mother\", nor \"You are a slayer of your brother\", nor \"You\nare a slayer of your sister\", nor \"you are a slayer of your preceptor\", nor \"You are a slayer of a\nBrahmana\".\nVII-xv-4: \u2018Prana indeed becomes all these. He, indeed, who sees thus, thinks thus and knows thus\nbecomes a surpassing speaker. If someone were to say to him, \"You are a surpassing speaker\", he\nshould say, \"Yes, I am a surpassing speaker\", he should not deny it.\nVII-xvi-1: \u2018But he really speaks surpassingly who speaks surpassingly with truth\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, being\nsuch, I would speak surpassingly with truth\u2019. \u2018But one must desire to understand the truth\u2019. \u2018Revered\nsir, I desire to understand the truth\u2019.\nVII-xvii-1: \u2018When one understands, then alone does one declare the truth. Without understanding, one\ndoes not declare the truth. Only he who understands declares the truth. But one must desire to\nunderstand understanding.\u2019 \u2018Revered sir, I desire to understand understanding\u2019.\n\nVII-xviii-1: \u2018When one reflects, then alone does one understand. Without reflecting one does not\nunderstand. Only he who reflects understands. But one must desire to understand reflection.\u2019 \u2018Revered\nsir, I desire to understand reflection\u2019.\nVII-xix-1: \u2018When one has faith, then alone does one reflect. Without faith, one does not reflect. Only he\nwho has faith reflects. But one must desire to understand faith\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, I desire to understand\nfaith\u2019.\nVII-xx-1: \u2018When one has steadfastness, then alone does one have faith. Without steadfastness, one does\nnot have faith. Only he who has steadfastness has faith. But one must desire to understand\nsteadfastness.\u2019 \u2018Revered sir, I desire to understand steadfastness.\u2019\nVII-xxi-1: \u2018When one acts, then alone does one become steadfast. Without acting, one does not become\nsteadfast. Only on acting does one become steadfast. But one must desire to understand activity\u2019.\n\u2018Revered sir, I desire to understand activity\u2019.\nVII-xxii-1: \u2018When one obtains happiness\u2019, then alone does one act. Without obtaining happiness one\ndoes not act. Only on obtaining happiness does one act. But one must desire to understand happiness\u2019.\n\u2018Revered sir, I desire to understand happiness\u2019.\nVII-xxiii-1: That which is infinite, is alone happiness. There is no happiness in anything finite. The\ninfinite alone is happiness. But one must desire to understand the infinite\u2019. \u2018Revered sir, I desire to\nunderstand the infinite\u2019.\nVII-xxiv-1: \u2018In which one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is\ninfinite. But that in which one sees something else, hears something else, understands something else,\nis the finite. That which is infinite, is alone immortal, and that which is finite, is mortal\u2019. \u2018Revered sir,\nin what is that infinite established ?\u2019 \u2018On its own greatness or not even on its own greatness\u2019.\nVII-xxiv-2: \u2018Here in this world people call cows and horses, elephants and gold, servants and wives,\nfields and houses, \"greatness\". I do not speak thus (of greatness), for in that case one thing would be\nestablished in another. What I do say is thus:\nVII-xxv-1: \u2018That infinite alone is below. That is above. That is behind. That is in front. That is to the\nsouth. That is to the north. That alone is all this. So next is the teaching in regard to the self-sense. I\nalone am below. I am above. I am behind. I am in front. I am to the south. I am to the north. I alone am\nall this.\nVII-xxv-2: \u2018So now is the teaching through Atman. Atman alone is below. Atman is above. Atman is\nbehind. Atman is in front. Atman is to the south. Atman is to the north. Atman alone is all this. Verily,\nhe it is who sees thus, and understands thus, has pleasure in Atman, delight in Atman, union in Atman,\njoy in Atman. He becomes Self-sovereign; he becomes free to act as he wishes in all the worlds. But\nthose who know otherwise than this are ruled by others and live in perishable worlds; they are not free\nto act as they wish in all the worlds.\nVII-xxvi-1: Verily, for him alone, who sees thus, reflects thus and understands thus, Prana springs from\nAtman, aspiration from Atman, memory from Atman, Akasa from Atman, fire from Atman, water from\nAtman, appearance and disappearances from Atman, food from Atman, strength from Atman,\nunderstanding from Atman, contemplation from Atman, intelligence from Atman, will from Atman,\nmind from Atman, speech from Atman, name from Atman, hymns from Atman, rites from Atman, all\nthis (springs) from Atman alone.\nVII-xxvi-2: \u2018There is this verse about it: \"He who sees this does not see death nor illness nor any\nsorrow. He who sees this sees all things and obtains all things in all ways.\" \u2018He is one, becomes\n\nthreefold, fivefold, sevenfold and also ninefold. Then again he is called the elevenfold, also a hundredand-ten-fold and also a thousand-and twenty-fold. \u2018\u2019When nourishment is pure, reflection and higher\nunderstanding become pure. When reflection and higher understanding are pure, memory becomes\nstrong. When memory becomes strong, there is release from all the knots of the heart. The revered\nSanatkumara showed to Narada, after his impurities had been washed off, the further shore of darkness.\nPeople call Sanatkumara as Skanda \u2013 yea, they call him Skanda.\nVIII-i-1: Om. Now, in this city of Brahman, there is a mansion in the shape of a small lotus; in it is a\nsmall inner Akasa. What is within that, that should be sought; that indeed, one should desire to\nunderstand.\nVIII-i-2-3: If the disciples should say to him, \u2018In this city of Brahman in which is a small mansion in\nthe shape of a lotus and in the small inner Akasa within \u2013 what is it that lies there which should be\nsought, which one should desire to understand ?\u2019 \u2013 he should say in reply, \u2018As large indeed as is this\nAkasa, so large is that Akasa in the heart. Within it, indeed, are contained both heaven and earth, both\nfire and air, both the sun and the moon, lightning and the stars. Whatever there is of him in this world\nand whatever is not, all that is contained within it.\u2019\nVIII-i-4: If they should say to him, \u2018If in this city of Brahman is contained all this, all beings and all\ndesires, then what is left of it when old age overtakes it or when it perishes ?\u2019\nVIII-i-5: He should say, \u2018It (the Brahman called inner Akasa) does not age with the ageing of the body,\nit is not killed by the killing of this. This (Akasa) is the real city of Brahman, in it are contained the\ndesires. This is the Atman, free from evil, free from old age, free from death, free from sorrow, free\nfrom hunger, free from thirst, whose desire is of the truth, whose resolve is of the truth. Just as in this\nworld, the subjects follow as they are commanded and whatever province they desire, be it a country or\na part of the field, on that they live. (So the ignorant depend upon others for enjoying the fruits of their\nKarma).\nVIII-i-6: \u2018Just as here on earth the world which is earned by work perishes, even so there in the other\nworld, the world which is earned by righteous deeds perishes. So those who depart from here without\nhaving understood the Atman and these true desires, for them there is no freedom to act as they wish in\nall the worlds. But those who depart from here, having understood the Atman and these true desires, for\nthem there is freedom to act as they wish in all the worlds.\u2019\nVIII-ii-1: If he becomes desirous of the world of fathers, by his mere will, fathers arise. Possessed of\nthat world of fathers he feels happy and exalted.\nVIII-ii-2: And if he becomes desirous of the world of mothers, by his mere will, mothers arise.\nPossessed of that world of mothers he feels happy and exalted.\nVIII-ii-3: And if he becomes desirous of the world of brothers, by his mere will, brothers arise.\nPossessed of that world of brothers he feels happy and exalted.\nVIII-ii-4: And if he becomes desirous of the world of sisters, by his mere will, sisters arise. Possessed\nof that world of sisters he feels happy and exalted.\nVIII-ii-5: And if he becomes desirous of the world of friends, by his mere will, friends arise. Possessed\nof that world of friends he feels happy and exalted.\nVIII-ii-6: And if he becomes desirous of the world of perfumes and garlands, by his mere will, of\nperfumes and garlands arise. Possessed of that world of perfumes and garlands he feels happy and\nexalted.\nVIII-ii-7: And if he becomes desirous of the world of food and drink, by his mere will, food and drink\narise. Possessed of that world of food and drink he feels happy and exalted.\nVIII-ii-8: And if he becomes desirous of the world of song and music, by his mere will, song and music\narise. Possessed of that world of song and music he feels happy and exalted.\nVIII-ii-9: And if he becomes desirous of the world of women, by his mere will, women arise. Possessed\n\nof that world of women he feels happy and exalted.\nVIII-ii-10: Whatever provinces he is attached to and whatever desirable objects he desires by his mere\nwill, they(arise. Possessed of that he feels happy and exalted.\nVIII-iii-1: These same are the true desires covdred by the untrue. Although the desires are true, they are\ncovered by the untrue. For whosoever of one\u2019s people departs from here in this world one does not get\nhim back to see.\nVIII-iii-2: But those of his people, whether they are alive or dead and whatever else one desires but\ndoes not get, all that one finds by going there (into the Atman, the Akasa in the heart); for here, indeed,\nare those true desires of his covered by the untrue. Just as, though people who do not know the field\nwalk again and again over the treasure of gold hidden underground but do not find it, even so all these\ncreatures here, though they go daily into the Brahman-world, yet do not find it, for they are carried\naway by the untrue.\nVIII-iii-3: This Atean verily is in the heart. Its etymological explanation is this. This (Atman) is in the\nheart, hence it is the heart. He who knows thus(indeed goes daily into the heavenly world.\nVIII-iii-4: Now that serene and happy being, rising out of this body and reaching the highest light,\nappears in his own true form. This is the Atman, said the teacher. This is the immortal, the fearless. This\nis Brahman. Verily, the name of this Brahman is the True.\nVIII-iii-5: These are indeed the three syllables, \u2018sa\u2019, \u2018ti\u2019, \u2018yam\u2019. What is \u2018sa\u2019, that is the immortal, and\nwhat is \u2018ti\u2019, that is the mortal, and what is \u2018yam\u2019, with it one holds the two together. Because with it one\nholds the two together, therefore it is \u2018yam\u2019. Verily, he who knows thus goes to the heavenly world.\u2019\nVIII-iv-1: Now, this Atman is the dyke, the embankment for the safety of these worlds. This dyke,\nneither the day nor the night crosses, nor old age nor death nor sorrow, nor merit nor demerit. All evils\nturn back from it, for this Brahman-world is free from evil.\nVIII-iv-2: Therefore, verily, on reaching this dyke, if one was blind he ceases to be blind; if wounded,\nhe ceases to be wounded, if afflicted- he ceases to be afflicted. Therefore, verily, on reaching this dyke,\neven night becomes day, for this Brahman-world is ever illumined.\nVIII-iv-3: But only those who attain according to the iostruction this Brahman-world through\nBrahmacharya, to them belongs this Brahman-world. For them there is freedom to act as they wish in\nall the worlds.\nVIII-v-1: Now, what people call sacrifice is really Brahmacharya, for only by means of Brahmacharya\ndoes the knower attain that world. And what people call worship (Ista) is really Brahmacharya, for only\nby worshipping with Brahmacharya does one attain the Atman.\nVIII-v-2: Now, what people call the sacrificial session is really Brahmacharya, for only by means of\nBrahmacharya does one obuain one\u2019s salvation from Being. And what people call the vow of silence is\nreally Brahmacharya for only through Brahmacharya does one understand the Atman and then\nmeditate.\nVIII-v-3: Now, what people call a course of fasting is really Brahmacharya, for this Atman never\nperishes which one attains by means of Brahmacharya. And what people call the life of a hermit is\nreally Brahmacharya, for verily Ara and Nya are the two oceans in the Brahman-world in the third\nheaven from here and therein is the lake Airammadiya, and there is the Aparajita (unconquered) city of\nBrahma, and there is the gold hall specially built by the Lord.\nVIII-v-4: Therefore only those who attain the two oceans, Ara and Nya, in the Brahman-world by\nmeans of Brahmacharya, only to them belongs this Brahman-world and for them there is freedom to act\nas they wish in all the worlds.\nVIII-vi-1: Now, these arteries which belong to the heart exist filled with the juice of a fine substance\nwhich is reddish-brown, white, blue, yellow and red. The yonder sun indeed is reddish-brown, he is\n\nwhite, he is blue, he is yellow, he is red.\nVIII-vi-2: Just as an extending highway runs between two villages, this as well as that, even so the rays\nof the sun go to both these worlds, this as well as that. They spread out of the yonder sun and enter into\nthese arteries. Out of these arteries they spread and enter into the yonder sun.\nVIII-vi-3: Therefore when one is thus sound sleep, composed, serene so that he knows no dreams, then\nhe enters into (the Akasa of the heart through) these arteries. Then no evil touches him for then he is\nfilled with the light of the sun.\nVIII-vi-4: Now, when one is thus reduced to a weakened condition, those who sit around him say, \u2018Do\nyou know me ? Do you know me ?\u2019 As long as he has not departed from this body, so long he knows\nthem.\nVIII-vi-5: But when he thus departs from this body, then he proceeds upwards through those very rays,\n(if a knower) he surely goes up meditating on Om or (does not got up if he is not a knower). As long as\nit takes for the mind to travel, in that (short) time, he goes to the sun. That indeed is the door to the\nworld (of Brahman), an entrance for the knowers and a shutting out for the ignorant.\nVIII-vi-6: There is this verse about it: A hundred and one are the arteries of the heart; one of them leads\nup to the crown of the head. Passing upwards through that, one attains immortality, while the other\narteries serve for departing in various other directions \u2013 yea, serve for departing.\nVIII-vii-1: The Atman which is free from evil, free from old age, free from death, free from sorrow,\nfree from hunger and thirst, whose desire is of the truth, whose resolve is of the truth, he should be\nsought, him one should desire to understand. He who has found out and who understands that Atman\nattains all the worlds and all the desires. Thus spoke Prajapati.\nVIII-vii-2: Both the gods and the demons heard this and said, \u2018Well, let us seek that Atman by seeking\nwhich one attains all the worlds and all the desires.\u2019 Then Indra alone from among the gods went out\nand so did Virochana from among the demons. Then without communicating with each other, they both\ncame into the presence of Prajapati, fuel in hand.\nVIII-vii-3: For thirty-two years they lived there the disciplined life of a celibate student of sacred\nknowledge. Then Prajapati asked them, \u2018Desiring what have you been living ?\u2019 They replied, \u2018The\nAtman which is free from evil, free from old age, free from death, free from sorrow, free from hunger\nand thirst, whose desire is of the truth, whose resolve is of the truth, he should be sought, him one\nshould desire to understand. He who has found out and who understands that Atman attain all the\nworlds and all the desires \u2013 these are known to be the words of your revered self. Desiring that Atman\nwe have been living.\u2019\nVIII-vii-4: Prajapati said to them, \u2018The person which is seen in the eye is the Atman\u2019. He added, \u2018This\nis the immortal, the fearless. This is Brahman\u2019. \u2018But, revered sir, he who is perceived in water and he\nwho in a mirror, which of these is the Atman ?\u2019 It is he himself that is perceived in all these\u2019, replied\nPrajapati.\nVIII-viii-1: \u2018Look at yourself in a pan of water and whatever you do not understand of the Atman, tell\nme that\u2019. Then they looked in a pan of water. Prajapati asked them, \u2018What do you see ?\u2019 They replied,\n\u2018Revered sir, we both see the self entirely as we are, the very image, even to the very hairs and nails.\u2019\nVIII-viii-2: Then Prajapati said to them, \u2018Having become well adorned, well dressed and well groomed,\nlook into the pan of water.\u2019 They too, having become well adorned, well dressed and well groomed,\nlooked into the pan of water. Then Prajapati asked them, \u2018What do you see ?\u2019\nVIII-viii-3: They replied, \u2018Just as we are ourselves, revered sir, well adorned, well dressed and well\ngroomed, even so are both these, revered sir, well adorned, well dressed and well groomed.\u2019 \u2018This is the\nAtman\u2019, said he, \u2018this is the immortal, the fearless. This is Brahman\u2019. They both went away satisfied in\ntheir hearts.\nVIII-viii-4: Then Prajapati looked at them and said, \u2018They are going away without having perceived,\n\nwithout having understood the Atman. Whosoever will follow such a doctrine be they gods or demons,\nthey will be foiled.\u2019 Now, Virochana, satisfied in his heart, went to the demons and declared this\ndoctrine to them. \u2018Here the (bodily) self alone is to be worshipped, the self is to be attended upon. Here\nit is only by worshipping the self and attending upon the self that one obtains both the worlds, this as\nwell as the yonder.\u2019\nVIII-viii-5: Therefore, even to this day, here people say of one who is not a giver, who has no faith,\nwho does not perform sacrifices, \u2018Oh, he is a demon\u2019; for this is the doctrine of the demons. They adorn\nthe body of the deceased with enjoyable things, clothes and ornaments for, by this, they think, they will\nwin the other world.\nVIII-ix-1: But Indra, even before reaching the gods, saw this difficulty: \u2018Just as this (reflected self)\nbecomes well adorned when this body is well adorned, well dressed when the body is well dressed,\nwell groomed when the body is well groomed, even so this (reflected self) also becomes blind when the\nbody is blind, one-eyed when the body is one-eyed, crippled when the body is crippled, and it perishes\nwhen this body perishes. I see no good in this.\u2019\nVIII-ix-2: He came back again, fuel in hand. Prajapati asked him, \u2018Desiring what, O Indra, have you\ncome back, since you went away satisfied in your heart, along with Virochana ?\u2019 Indra replied,\n\u2018Revered sir, just as this (reflected self) becomes well adorned when this body is well adorned, well\ndressed when the body is well dressed, well groomed when the body is well groomed, even so this\n(reflected self) also becomes blind when the body is blind, one-eyed when the body is one-eyed,\ncrippled when the body is crippled, and it perishes when this body perishes. I see no good in this.\nVIII-ix-3: \u2018So is it indeed, O Indra\u2019, said Prajapati; \u2018However, I shall explain this further to you. Live\nhere for another thirty-two years.\u2019 He lived there for another thirty-two years. Then Prajapati said to\nhim:\nVIII-x-1-2: Prajapati said, \u2018He who moves about in dreams, he is the Atman. He is the immortal, the\nfearless. He is Brahman\u2019. Indra went away satisfied in his heart. But even before reaching the gods he\nsaw this difficulty: \u2018Even though this (dream-self) is not blind when this body is blind, nor one-eyed\nwhen the body is slain, nor has running nose and eyes when the body has running nose and eyes, yet it\nis as if they kill it, as if they chase it, it becomes conscious of pain, as it were, and even weeps, as it\nwere. I see no good in this\u2019.\nVIII-x-3-4: He came back again, fuel in hand. Prajapati asked him, \u2018Desiring what, O Indra, have you\ncome back, since you went away satisfied in your heart ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018Revered sir, even though this\nself is not blind when this body is blind, nor one-eyed when the body is one-eyed, nor suffers defects\nfrom the defects of the body, nor is slain when the body is slain, nor has running nose and eyes, yet it is\nas if they kill it, as if they chase it, it becomes conscious of pain as it were, and even weeps, as it were.\nI see no good in this\u2019. \u2018So is it indeed, O Indra\u2019, said Prajapati; \u2018However, I shall explain this further to\nyou. Live here for another thirty-two years.\u2019 He lived there for another thirty-two years. Then Prajapati\nsaid to him:\nVIII-xi-1: Prajapati said, \u2018He who is fully asleep, composed, serene and knows no dream, he is the\nAtman. He is the immortal, the fearless. He is Brahman\u2019. Indra went away satisfied in his heart. But\neven before reaching the gods he saw this difficulty: \u2018In truth this one does not know himself now as \"I\nam he\", nor indeed these beings. It seems as if he has gone to annihilation. I see no good in this\u2019.\nVIII-xi-2: He came back again, fuel in hand. Prajapati asked him, \u2018Desiring what, O Indra, have you\ncome back, since you went away satisfied in your heart ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018Revered sir, in truth this one\ndoes not know himself as \"I am he\", nor indeed these beings. It seems as if he has gone to annihilation.\nI see no good in this\u2019.\nVIII-xi-3: \u2018So is it indeed, O Indra\u2019, said Prajapati; \u2018However, I shall explain this further to you and\nnone other than this. Live here for another five years.\u2019 He lived there for another five years. That makes\n\none hundred and one years and so with regard to that, people say thus, \u2018Verily, for one hundred and one\nyears Indra lived with Prajapati the disciplined life of a celibate student of sacred knowledge\". Then\nPrajapati said to him:\nVIII-xii-1: \u2018O Indra, mortal indeed is this body, held by death. But it is the support of this deathless,\nbodiless Atman. Verily, the embodied self is held by pleasure and pain. Surely, there is no cessation of\npleasure and pain for one who is embodied. But pleasure and pain do not indeed touch one who is\nbodiless.\nVIII-xii-2-3: Bodiless is air; and white cloud, lightning, thunder, these also are bodiless. Now as these\narise out of the yonder Akasa, reach the highest light and appear each with its own form, even so this\nserene one rises out of this body, reaches the highest light and appears in his own form. He is the\nHighest Person. There he moves about, laughing, playing, rejoicing with women, vehicles or relations,\nnot remembering this body in which he was born. As an animal is attached to a chariot, even so is the\nPrana attached to this body.\nVIII-xii-4: Now, where the sight merges in Akasa (inside the eye, i.e., the black pupil of the eye), (there\nexists) that which is the person in the eye; and the eye is only for (his) seeing. And he who knows \u2018I\nsmell this\u2019, is the Atman; the nose is for smelling. And he who knows \u2018I speak this\u2019, is the Atman, the\norgan of speech is for speaking. And he who knows \u2018I hear this\u2019, is the Atman; the ear is for hearing.\nVIII-xii-5: And he who knows \u2018I think this\u2019, is the Atman, the mind is his divine eye. Through this\ndivine eye of the mind he verily sees these desired objects which are in the Brahman-world, and\nrejoices.\nVIII-xii-6: \u2018Verily, this is the Atman whom the gods worship. Therefore all the worlds and all the\ndesired objects are held by them. He obtains all the worlds all the desired objects, who having known\nthat Atman (from the teacher and the scriptures) understands it.\u2019 Thus spoke Prajapati \u2013 yea, thus spoke\nPrajapati.\nVIII-xiii-1: From the dark I attain to the variegated from the variegated I attain to the dark. Shaking off\nevil as a horse his hairs, shaking off the body as the moon frees itself from the mouth of Rahu, I, having\nfulfilled all ends, obtain the eternal Brahman-world \u2013 yea, I obtain it.\nVIII-xiv-1: Verily, what is called Akasa is the revealer of name and form. That within which they are, is\nBrahman, that is the immortal, that is the Atman. \u2018I attain to the assembly-hall and abode of Prajapati. I\nam the glory of the Brahmanas, the glory of the Kshatriyas, the glory of the Vaisyas. I wish to attain\nthat glory. I am the glory of the glories. May I never go to that which is reddish-white and toothless yet\ndevouring and slippery \u2013 yea, may I never go to it.\u2019\nVIII-xv-1: Brahma expounded this to Prajapati. Prajapati to Manu and Manu to his descendants. He\nwho has read the Veda according to the prescribed rule, in the time left over after performing his duties\nto the teacher, he who after having come back from the teacher\u2019s house, settles down in his household,\ncontinues the study of the Veda in a clean place, and has virtuous sons and disciples, he who withdraws\nall his senses into the Atman, who practises non-injury to all beings except in places specially ordained,\nhe who behaves thus throughout his life reaches the world of Brahman and does not return again \u2013 yea,\nhe does not return again.\nOm ! Let my limbs and speech, Prana, eyes, ears, vitality\nAnd all the senses grow in strength.\nAll existence is the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nMay I never deny Brahman, nor Brahman deny me.\nLet there be no denial at all:\nLet there be no denial at least from me.\n\nMay the virtues that are proclaimed in the Upanishads be in me,\nWho am devoted to the Atman; may they reside in me.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Chandogyopanishad, as contained in the Sama-Veda.\n\nChandogya Upanishad Commentary\nCommentary on the Chandogya Upanishad\u2013by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\nThe Glory of Om\nIn this commentary I will be mostly using the translation of Swami Prabhavananda. In his\ntranslations of some upanishads Swami Prabhavananda omitted some parts, many that were in\nsuch obscure language that any attempt at translation would really only be speculation. He also\nomitted very repetitious passages and those that dwelt with matters irrelevant to the knowledge\nof Brahman and the Self. That is why in the references to the verses of this upanishad there will\nbe some jumping around. However, Prabhavananda omitted some passages that I think are\nextremely important. So I will be supplementing his translation.\nMeditation on Om\n\u201cOne should meditate on the syllable Om, the Udgitha. Of this, the explanation follows.\u201d (Chandogya\nUpanishad 1.1.1)\nThis leaves us little doubt as to what the author (or authors) of the Chandogya Upanishad consider the\nsubject of prime importance: meditation on Om. \u201cUdgitha\u201d is the technical, ritual term for Om when It\nis sung aloud in Vedic recitation. So in the subsequent verses I am just going to put Om wherever\nUdgitha occurs.\nThe supreme essence\n\u201cThe essence of man is speech. The essence of speech is the hymns of the Rig Veda. Their essence is\nthe hymns of the Sama Veda. The essence of the Sama Veda is Om.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 1.1.2)\nThat which marks human beings out from the lesser forms of evolution is the power of vak\u2013of\nsymbolic, creative speech. Most animals make some kinds of sounds that indicate their feelings, but\nonly humans have symbolic words that recount and stimulate both thought and behavior. This is the\npower of logos spoken of in Greek philosophy and Eastern Christian writings. It is not just a simple\ntrait, but a virtual intellectual ocean that separates us from other sentient beings on earth. It is, as said, a\nproduct of evolution, and skill in speech is the mark of an evolved human being, though the most\n\nimportant ability is that of creative thought/conceptualization. Vak is what makes us human.\nThe highest form of Speech is that of the hymns of the Rig Veda that were revealed in meditation\nuntold thousands of years ago to the Vedic Rishis (Seers). The highest of those hymns were collected\ninto the Sama Veda, whose text is marked (pointed) for devotional singing. And the supreme essence of\nthe Sama Veda hymns is the single syllable: OM. In many texts it is stated that to intone Om is to recite\nall the Vedic hymns. Therefore:\n\u201cThe syllable Om which is called Udgitha, is the quintessence of the essences, the supreme, deserving\nof the highest place.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 1.1.3) This can be said, because Om is the Primal Word,\nthe Original Sound, the First Word \u201cspoken\u201d by God, and by which all that \u201cis\u201d was created, and is\nbeing sustained and evolved at this very moment. The Vedic Seers long ago stated: \u201cIn the beginning\nwas Prajapati [God the Creator], with Him was the Word, and the Word was truly the Supreme\nBrahman.\u201d (Prajapati vai idam agra asit. Tasya vak dvitiya asit. Vag vai paramam Brahman. Krishna\nYajurveda, Kathaka Samhita, 12.5, 27.1; Krishna Yajurveda, Kathakapisthala Samhita, 42.1; Jaiminiya\nBrahmana II, Samaveda, 2244) This was much later paraphrased in the opening verses of the Gospel of\nSaint John: \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The\nsame was in the beginning with God.\u201d (John 1:1,2)\nChandogya Upanishad 2.23.3 says that Brahma the creator concentrated his awareness on the worlds he\nhad projected and: \u201cFrom them, thus brooded upon, issued forth [as their essence] the syllable Om. Just\nas all the parts of the leaf, are permeated by the ribs of the leaf, so are all the words permeated by the\nsyllable Om. Verily, the syllable Om is all this\u2013yea, the syllable Om is verily all this.\u201d\nEverything is contained in Om, as other upanishadic texts enumerate, including all the possible states\nof consciousness, the expanse of time (past, present, future), the three worlds (physical, astral, causal)\u2013\nALL. The upanishadic teaching is that Om is identical with Brahman Itself. How then can we regard It\nas anything other than \u201cthe quintessence of the essences, the supreme, deserving of the highest place\u201d?\nThe divine union\n\u201cSpeech [Vak] and Breath [Prana] taken together form a couple. This couple is joined together in the\nsyllable Om. Whenever a couple come together, they, indeed, fulfill each other\u2019s desire.\u201d (Chandogya\nUpanishad 1.1.5,6) This is a most important fact, and one that is explained very fully in the fourth\nchapter (Breath and Sound in Meditation) of Om Yoga: Its Theory and Practice.\nFulfiller of desires\n\u201cHe who meditates upon Om knowing it thus (as the fulfiller), verily becomes a fulfiller of all the\ndesirable ends. That verily is the syllable of assent, for whenever one assents to a thing, one says only\n\u2018Om\u2019. Assent alone is prosperity. He who meditates upon Om, knowing it thus (as endowed with the\nquality of prosperity), verily becomes one who increases all the desirable ends.\u201d (Chandogya\nUpanishad 1.1.7,8)\nThis is important for two reasons. First, that Om contains within Itself creative power, and IS Creative\nPower. Naturally, we must both know how to employ It and to be of such a level of consciousness that\nwe can do with It what God does with It. This is certainly possible. I have known yogis who could heal\nwith Om and do many other \u201cmagical\u201d things that were really quite normal for the person who knew\nhow. That is why this section is concluded with these words:\n\u201cWhatever is performed with knowledge, faith and meditation becomes more effective. Up to this truly\n\nis the explanation of (the greatness of) this syllable Om.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 1.1.10)\nThe second important point is that the yogi need not be a person who lives in a bare subsistence\nmanner, unworldly, impractical and indifferent to all material things including his body. The opposite is\ntrue. In the eighth chapter of this upanishad we find these verses: \u201cIf the sage desires to see his fathers\nof the spirit-world, lo, his fathers come to meet him. In their company he is happy. And if he desires to\nsee his mothers of the spirit-world, lo, his mothers come to meet him. In their company he is happy.\nAnd if he desires to see his brothers of the spirit-world, lo, his brothers come to meet him. In their\ncompany he is happy. And if he desires to see his sisters of the spirit-world, lo, his sisters come to meet\nhim. In their company he is happy. And if he desires to see his friends of the spirit-world, lo, his friends\ncome to meet him. In their company he is happy. And if he desires heavenly perfumes and garlands, lo,\nheavenly perfumes and garlands come to him. In their possession he is happy. And if he desires\nheavenly food and drink, lo, heavenly food and drink come to him. In their possession he is happy. And\nif he desires heavenly song and music, lo, heavenly song and music come to him. In their possession he\nis happy. Indeed, whatsoever such a knower of Brahman may desire, straightway it is his; and having\nobtained it, he is exalted of men.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8.2.1-10)\nSuch is the real yogi, the true adept. I remember a recording of Paramhansa Yogananda in which he\nspoke about how many mortgages he had paid off, how much property he had bought, and how large a\n\u201cfamily\u201d he had supported for decades. \u201cI could have kept away a million dollars and no one would\nhave known,\u201d he said, speaking of the abundance that had come to him after enduring great hardship\nand remaining faithful to the ideals he had been sent to America to teach and practice. (A Bengali song\nin his honor says: \u201cGoing far away you taught dharma. And that dharma which you taught, you showed\nperfectly in your life.\u201d) Then he told his hearers that despite all the financial outlay, he only had a little\nbox that was never empty by God\u2019s grace, and he never bothered to count how much was in it. One of\nIndia\u2019s greatest yogis was Janaka, whose name is invoked as the symbol of tremendous wealth as well\nas wisdom. They speak of Janaka in India as we do of Midas in the West.\nSuch is Om; such are those that meditate upon It.\n\nThe Gods and Om\nThroughout the upanishads, Gita, and other spiritual texts we find references to gods\u2013in Sanskrit:\ndevas. A Brief Sanskrit Glossary defines deva in this way: \u201c\u2018A shining one,\u2019 a god\u2013greater or lesser in\nthe evolutionary hierarchy; a semi-divine or celestial being with great powers, and therefore a \u2018god.\u2019\nSometimes called a demi-god. Devas are the demigods presiding over various powers of material and\npsychic nature. In many instances \u2018devas\u2019 refer to the powers of the senses or the sense organs\nthemselves.\u201d\nThe sun\n\u201cNow the meditation on Om with reference to the gods is described. One should meditate on the sun as\nOm. Verily, when he rises, he sings aloud for the sake of all creatures.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 1.3.1)\nWe should skip ahead a little bit to continue this subject.\n\u201cNow, that which is Om is verily Pranava and that which is Pranava is Om. The yonder sun is Om and\nalso Pranava, for he moves along pronouncing \u2018Om.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 1.5.1) That is, the\nenergy of the sun is a manifestation of Om. Scientists have only recently discovered this phenomenon.\nOn page 16 of the July 2004 issue of National Geographic we find this: \u201cBubbles the size of Texas\ncover the sun\u2019s face\u2026. Called granules, the short-lived cells of plasma carry heat to the surface through\n\nconvection, the same way water boils in a pot. The rise and fall of granules creates sound waves, which\ncause the sun to throb like a drum every five minutes.\u201d\nIn The Word That is God we find the following comment: \u201cAll plant, animal, and human life on this\nplanet depends upon the sun. It is the subtle powers of sunlight which stimulate growth and evolution.\nSunlight particularly stimulates the activity of the higher centers in the brain, especially that of the\npineal gland. Even in the depths of the earth a sensitive man can tell when the sun rises and sets above\nhim. The sun truly awakens us in the deepest sense. As the germinating seed struggles upward toward\nthe sun and out into its life-giving rays, so all higher forms of life reach out for the sun, which acts as a\nmetaphysical magnet, drawing them upward and outward toward ever-expanding consciousness.\nSunlight is the radiant form of Om. The sun initiates the entire solar system into Om. Human beings are\nsolar creatures, therefore to intone Om is the most natural things they can do.\u201d Later the upanishad\nsays: \u201cReflect upon Om as the rays of the sun.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 1.5.2)\nFurther on we find a section that speaks of the divine Person (Purusha) who ensouls and enlivens the\nsun: Ishwara. \u201cNow, that Person, effulgent as gold, who is seen within the sun, who is with golden\nbeard and golden hair, is exceedingly effulgent even to the very tips of his nails. His eyes are bright like\na red lotus. He is above all evils. (Verily, he who knows thus rises above all evils.) He is Om.\nMoreover, he controls the worlds which are above that sun, as also the desires of the gods.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 1.6.6-8)\nEven further on we are told that Om is like the flower of the sun. When the yogi-bees \u201cpressed this\nPranava, from It, thus pressed, issued forth as juice: fame, splendor of limbs, alertness of the senses,\nvirility, and nourishment.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 3.5.2)\nThe most important aspect of the solar connection with Om is found in the eighth section of the\nupanishad. There it speaks of the nadis, the subtle energy channels that function in the subtle bodies of\nhuman beings. Then it says that \u201cJust as an extending highway runs between two villages, this as well\nas that, even so the rays of the sun go to both these worlds, this as well as that. They spread out of the\nyonder sun and enter into these nadis. Out of these nadis they spread and enter into the yonder sun.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 8.6.2) Regarding one who meditates on Om, the upanishad continues: \u201cWhen\nhe thus departs from this body, then he proceeds upwards through those very rays. He surely goes up\nmeditating on Om. As long as it takes for the mind to travel, in that time he goes to the sun. That indeed\nis the door to the world of Brahman, an entrance for the knowers and a shutting out for the ignorant.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 8.6.5) Those who pass through the sun are free from the compulsion to rebirth\non the earth. Om!\nThe breath and Om\nThe connection between the sun and our breath is next described. \u201cThis breath and that sun are the\nsame. Therefore one should meditate on this breath and that sun as Om.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 1.3.2)\nThis is why in Om Yoga we join our intonations of Om with the breath.\nThe upanishad continues: \u201cNow with reference to the body: One should meditate on the breath as Om,\nfor he moves along pronouncing \u2018Om.\u2019 Thinking thus, sing praise to Om as the manifold pranas. Now,\nthat which is Om, is verily Pranava; and that which is Pranava, is Om\u2013so one should think.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 1.5.3-5)\nEscaping death\nNow we have a parable about rising above the realm of death: samsara.\n\n\u201cOne should meditate on the syllable Om. Of this the explanation follows. Verily, the gods, being afraid\nof death, took refuge in the three Vedas. Just as a fisherman would see a fish in water, so did Death\nobserve the gods in the Vedic hymns. They, too, knowing this, arose and entered Om. This syllable Om\nis indeed immortality and fearlessness. Having entered into Om the gods became immortal and fearless.\nHe who worships this syllable knowing it thus, enters this syllable which is immortality and\nfearlessness. And having entered it, he becomes immortal by that amrita [Om], by which the gods\nbecame immortal.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 1.4.1-5)\nThe devas (gods) are all the aspects of the human being. Those who seek life and immortality in\nexternal rites\u2013indeed, in anything other than Brahman\u2013will be caught in the net of death just like fish in\nthe fisherman\u2019s net. But when they take refuge in the meditation of Om they rise above the realm of\neven the possibility of death. Of course this may also be a story of highly evolved beings who found\nthat they were still subject to death in the higher worlds, being forced to drop the subtle bodies proper\nto those realms and enter bodies on lesser levels or worlds. At the Mahapralaya, the Great Universal\nDissolution, all the worlds are shaken and dissolve away. The wise, knowing that, do not content\nthemselves with living in carefree and beautiful wish-fulfilling worlds, but busy themselves with\ntapasya to ascend beyond relativity. And they do this through meditation on Om.\nAnd so should we.\n\nThe Sages and Om\nThe upanishad gives some very interesting views on Om in the form of a discussion between three\nsages. We will look at a condensed version.\n\u201cIn ancient times there were three proficient in Om: Silaka the son of Salavat, Caikitayana of the\nDalbhya family and Pravahana the son of Jivala. They said, \u2018We are proficient in Om. If you agree, let\nus enter on a discussion of Om.\u2019 \u2018Let it be so\u2019, saying this they sat down.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad\n1.8.1,2)\nEther (Akasha)\nOm is a sound rising from the heart of all things; and the element of ether (akasha), which is its highest\nform, is consciousness, is the basis of all sound. (Ultimately, Om and consciousness are the same\nthing.) A Brief Sanskrit Glossary defines akasha in this way: \u201cEther; space; sky; literally: \u2018not visible.\u2019\nThe subtlest of the five elements (panchabhuta), from which the other four arise. It is all-pervading, and\nis sometimes identified with consciousness\u2013chidakasha. It is the basis of sound (shabda), which is its\nparticular property.\u201d This being so, the dialogue proceeds as follows: \u201cWhat is the essence of this\nworld?\u2019 Akasha. All these beings arise from akasha alone and are finally dissolved into akasha; because\nakasha alone is greater than all these and akasha is the support at all times.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad\n1.9.1)\nRemember, Om is the subject of this discussion, and since akasha is the foundation of sound, it moves\non, with this: \u201cIt is this Om which is progressively higher and better. This again is endless. He who,\nknowing thus, meditates upon the progressively higher and better Om, obtains progressively higher and\nbetter lives and wins progressively higher and better worlds.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 1.9.2)\nOm is the thread that runs through all levels of existence; It is the core of all worlds, emanating from\nthe Absolute that is beyond them all. By meditating on Om we ascend higher and higher, passing\nthrough the states of consciousness that correspond to higher and higher worlds. Whatever the state of\nmind we are established in at the time of death, it will take us into the corresponding world. \u201cWhatever\n\nstate of being [bhavam] he remembers when he gives up the body at the end, he invariably goes to that\nstate of being, transformed into that state of being.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 8:6)\nThere is another aspect to this. In meditation, our perceptions of Om become subtler and subtler. From\nbeing a mental repetition sounding just like it would if we were speaking aloud, it becomes softer and\nsofter, even whisperlike, eventually become a silent ideation or conceptualization while mysteriously\nremaining a complete word. This mutation takes place as our consciousness is moving into higher and\nhigher states of being or bhavas. Our experiencing of this is experiencing Om and the states of\nawareness inherent in It.\nThe conclusion\nThe upanishad sums it up like this:\n\u201cAtidhanvan, the son of Sunaka, having taught this to Udarasandilya, said, \u2018As long as among your\ndescendants, this knowledge of Om continues, so long their life in this world will be progressively\nhigher and better than ordinary lives. And in that other world also their state will be similar\u2019. He who\nknows and meditates thus\u2013his life in this world surely becomes progressively higher and better, and so\nalso his state in that other world\u2013yea, in that other world.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 1.9.3,4)\n\nFour Things God REALLY Wants You to\nKnow\nHave you ever seen, or been given, a little leaflet entitled \u201cFour Things God Wants You To Know\u201d?\nWhen I was young, long ago, it was quite a popular tool of Fundamentalist Protestants. It had four\nstatements\u2013mostly about sin, death, and hell\u2013backed up with Bible quotations. Usually there was a\nplace to sign on the back saying you were willing to let God save you. And that was it! Salvation for\nthe masses. Here in the Chandogya Upanishad we find the real four things we all need to know.\nDuty and realization\n\u201cThe requirements of duty [dharma] are three. The first is sacrifice, study, almsgiving; the\nsecond is austerity; the third is life as a student in the home of a teacher and the practice of\ncontinence. Together, these three lead one to the realm of the blest. But he who is firmly\nestablished in the knowledge of Brahman achieves immortality.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad\n2:23:1)\nThe basis of dharma, of life that leads to spiritual unfoldment has three elements which need scrutiny,\neach in turn.\nSacrifice, study, and almsgiving. Sacrifice (yajna) means formal religious observance, especially the\noffering of the daily activities to God, hopefully leading to the perfect offering of oneself to God\u2013\nIshwarapranidhana. Study (adhyaya) means just that, but study of spiritual texts, of the wisdom of the\nenlightened, and pondering the ways to incorporate that teaching into one\u2019s own life. This is serious\napplication to holy knowledge and its personal assimilation. Almsgiving (dana) means giving of time\nand money to the welfare of others. It is also the cultivation of generosity as a trait of mind and heart.\nThese three are discussed in the Bhagavad Gita, especially in chapter seventeen, as absolute necessities\non the spiritual path, never to be abandoned\u2013not even by the renunciate. For these are not part of\nworldly life, but essentials of spiritual life.\n\nAusterity\u2013tapasya\u2013is spiritual discipline, including control of mind, body, the factors of external life,\nand especially meditation. It is an entire reshaping and purification of the inner and outer life, not a\nmere dabbling or dalliance. It is total in its scope, and therefore total in its effect.\nLife as a student in the home of a teacher and the practice of continence. It is a fact that the earlier we\nbegin spiritual cultivation the more likely we are to persevere and therefore succeed. In the ancient\nculture of India from an early age everyone lived as a religious student in the house of a recognized\nspiritual teacher. Although the teacher imparted a great deal of practical, world-oriented knowledge, the\nprimary subject was always spiritual life and development through spiritual practice and religious\nactivities. Since the student remained in the teacher\u2019s house until the attainment of adulthood,\nbrahmacharya, sexual continence, was considered a fundament requisite\u2013so much so that the student\nwas called a brahmachari: one who observes continence.\nIn the West this system was totally unknown in the Indian form, but through the centuries it was not\nuncommon for monasteries and convents to permit children to live there and study, some becoming\nmonastics and others leaving and leading a secular life. The Franciscan Order had \u201cminor seminaries\u201d\nin which young boys began preparation for religious life, especially the priesthood, from a very young\nage. If one decided that he did not wish to eventually be a monk or priest he usually returned home and\ncontinued an ordinary course of study.\nBut here in the West the majority of those following Sanatana Dharma come to it as adults. They can\nengage in sacrifice, study, charity, and spiritual practice, but what about this factor, which the\nupanishad says is a requirement of dharma? Besides the general study of the basic scriptures of India,\nsuch persons will need to devote themselves to a particular form of spiritual cultivation. For example,\nsomeone can take up the study of teachings relating to a specific approach, such as the familiar paths of\nkarma, bhakti, and jnana. They may center their attention on a particular teacher, such as Shankara,\nRamanuja, Sri Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, Paramhansa Yogananda, Swami\nBhaktivedanta, or a contemporary teacher, of which there are many. Even if a teacher is no longer in\nthe body, through study and application of his teaching they can be his student. The \u201chome\u201d of a\nteacher is not a building or ashram, but that teacher\u2019s level of spiritual awareness. It is not easy to live\nin that real home, but it can and must be done. Only those who attune themselves to the teacher\u2019s\nconsciousness are true disciples. Physical proximity of itself means nothing. In India I have seen people\nthat lived for decades in an ashram, often personally attending on or travelling with the teacher\u2013and\nmany of them never really met the teacher once on the level that counts.\nFor all students of whatever form or situation, brahmacharya is needed. A teacher that does not tell\nthem that right from the start is no real teacher at all.\nThe blest and the Blesser\n\u201cTogether, these three lead one to the realm of the blest. But he who is firmly established in the\nknowledge of Brahman achieves immortality.\u201d\nHonesty in spiritual life is a necessity, on the side of the teacher and the student. True spiritual teaching\nis not a matter of marketing, of appealing to the consumer. Therefore facts that may not be palatable or\ncomforting are always to be found wherever truth is being taught. Degenerate religion revels in\nadjusting and dumbing down it teachings in order to gain more adherents, and therefore more power\nand money. True religion always follows the fundamental principle that the seeker conforms to the\nteaching, not the other way around. All of us really need to get this through our heads and into our\nhearts\u2013and thereby into our lives.\n\nI say this because we see that the upanishadic sage tells us the truth about what has been commended to\nus: they will take us into the \u201crealm of the blest.\u201d Now, he does not mean the earthlike \u201cheaven\u201d of\nmost religions, but the realm of the wise and holy who have evolved to the point where earthly rebirth\nis no longer needed. They\u2013and those who ascend there\u2013are liberated from that bondage, but they are\nstill subject to rebirth in the higher worlds, of which there is a seemingly infinite number. So, painless\nas it is, and happy as are the worlds involved in our subtle births and deaths, we are still bound and\nsubject to departing and returning. It is a higher and happy portion of the evolutionary ladder, but still\nnot our transcendental Home beyond the ladder for which attainment we originally came forth into\nrelative existence. So we must assiduously engage in the sacred three in order that we may at least\nbecome freed from earthly bonds, but always keeping in mind that there is something more needed: the\nknowledge of (not just about) Brahman. And we should be striving for that as well. So there really\nshould be four elements in our endeavor.\nOnly the knower of Brahman has immortality, for only he is freed from birth and death in all forms.\n\nThe Light Within\nThe Light of the Self\n\u201cThe light that shines above the heavens and above this world, the light that shines in the\nhighest world, beyond which there are no others\u2013that is the light that shines in the hearts of\nmen.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 3:13:7) Gambhirananda: \u201cNow, that Light which shines beyond\nthis heaven, beyond the whole creation, beyond everything, in the highest worlds which are\nunsurpassingly good, it is certainly this which is the light within a person.\u201d\nIt is the Atma Jyoti, the Light of the Self, which is also Divinity Itself. As a student of the upanishadic\nwisdom through his Master, Jesus, Saint John wrote: \u201cThis then is the message which we have heard of\nhim [Jesus], and declare unto you, that God is light.\u201d (I John 1:5) That Light is purely spiritual (Spirit,\nactually) beyond the light we see in this world, but which nevertheless is also a manifestation or\nextension of that Light, as is the entire creation. In all the worlds\u2013and beyond all the worlds\u2013it is the\nOne Light that shines in, and as, all. What a glorious concept! A truth as profound as it is simple. \u201cThe\nLord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.\u201d (Isaiah 60:19) This was the Essene\nteaching which Jesus received even in infancy.\nOriginal Christianity\u2013which was identical with Sanatana Dharma\u2013taught that the Divine Light \u201cwas the\nlight of men.\u2026the true Light, which lighteth every man\u201d (John 1:4, 9) without exception. That Light\ncannot be alienated from us, but is ever the essence of our existence, making us \u201cthe children of light.\u201d\n(John 12:36) This is the real Gospel, the Good News, of real religion.\nThe Light that IS Brahman\nThis Light is transcendent because God is transcendent\u2013and so are we! Because: \u201cTruly has this\nuniverse come forth from Brahman. In Brahman it lives and has its being. Assuredly, all is Brahman.\nLet a man, freed from the taint of passion, worship Brahman alone.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 3:14:1a)\nAgain Gambhirananda: \u201cAll this is Brahman. This is born from, dissolves in, and exists in That.\nTherefore, one should meditate by becoming calm.\u201d Really, what can\u2013or need be\u2013said about this\nincredible assertion: ALL is Brahman?\nWhat we can consider is the final part, the practical advice, which in the Sanskrit text is only two\nwords: shanta upasita. Literally, they mean: \u201cDraw near peacefully\u201d or: \u201cGo near peacefully.\u201d\nUpasana means to sit or draw near, and is usually understood to mean either worship or meditation. In\n\nthe Greek original of the New Testament the word translated \u201cprayer\u201d is prosevki, which also means to\ndraw near. The Greek word translated \u201cworship\u201d is proskuneo, which has the same meaning.\nThe important thing to realize is that true worship and meditation are both an inner process, for God is\nthe light that shines within each one of us, as the first verse quoted points out. So to draw near to that\nlight we must turn within. As Jesus said: \u201cNeither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the\nkingdom of God is within you.\u201d (Luke 17:21)\nThe inner search must be done shanta\u2013peacefully. This is a major key in yoga. All meditation must be\ndone calmly and carefully, otherwise it will be impossible to perceive and assimilate the subtle states of\nawareness which meditation should produce. The mind must be as still as a mirror to really meditate,\nand meditation alone produces that stillness. Meditation is being described by Saint Paul when he says:\n\u201cWe all, with open face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image\nfrom glory to glory.\u201d (II Corinthians 3:18) That is why in the book of Revelation, which Paramhansa\nYogananda said was a book about yoga, it says that a \u201csea of glass\u201d like a great mirror is before the\nthrone of God, and that the saints \u201cstand\u201d upon it. This symbolizes the perfectly still mind of the yogi\nby which he experiences higher realities. (Revelation 4:6, 15:2)\nThe yogi\u2019s will\nNow the second half of the verse we just examined: \u201cA man is, above all, his will. As is his will in this\nlife, so does he become when he departs from it. Therefore should his will be fixed on attaining\nBrahman.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 3:14:1b)\nThis is surely one of the most important statements in the upanishads. The will is the highest faculty we\npossess. It is higher even than the intellect, for we often say: \u201cI won\u2019t think about that right now\u2026\u201d and\nwe do not, because the will controls it. The only thing higher than the will is the Self. The will\napproaches closer to the Self than any other aspect of our being. This is so important, because the\nquality of our religion and our yoga is determined by which aspect is the basis of our belief and\npractice.\nWe have five levels or \u201cbodies.\u201d They are: 1) the physical, material body (annamaya kosha), 2) the\nmagnetic or bio-energetic body (pranamaya kosha), 3) the sensory mind (manomaya kosha), 4) the\nintelligent mind, the intellect (jnanamaya kosha), and 5) the will (anandamaya kosha). These also\ncorrespond to the five elements: earth (prithvi), water (apa), fire (agni), air (vayu), and ether (akasha)\nwhich are also the seats of the five senses\u2013smell, taste, sight, touch, and hearing.\nThe will is the anandamaya kosha, which corresponds to the ether element, whose special faculty is\nsound (shabda), both the passive faculty of hearing and the active faculty of speech. Which is why the\nhighest yoga is based on Sound\u2013specifically, the highest sound: Om. Om Yoga is the way to correct and\ndevelop the will. Since we are our will according to the upanishad, it must be made alive through the\ncontinual japa and meditation of the Pranava, the Word of Life: Om. Only through Om can we gain\nmastery of the will, and thereby of ourselves. We must become Om, \u201cthe Word that is God\u201d according\nto the Bhagavad Gita (7:8. \u201cI am the sacred syllable Om.\u201d 10:25). By becoming Om, we become God\u2013\nnot in the absolute sense, but in the relative sense of knowing ourselves as an eternal part of God,\nidentical in essence, even though not the Whole.\nIf in this life we become united to Brahman, when we leave this world we will go to Brahman. \u201cThen\nSatyakama, son of Shibi, asked him [the Rishi Pippalada]: \u2018Venerable Sir, what world does he who\nmeditates on Om until the end of his life, win by That?\u2019 To him, he said: \u2018That which is the sound Om,\nO Satyakama, is verily the higher and the lower Brahman. Therefore, with this support alone does the\n\nwise man reach the one or the other.\u2019\u2026If he meditates on the Supreme Being [Parampurusha] with the\nSyllable Om, he becomes one with the Light, the Sun. He is led to the world of Brahman. He sees the\nPerson that dwells in the body, Who is higher than the highest life. \u2026That the wise one attains, even by\nthe mere sound Om as support, That Which is tranquil, unaging, immortal, fearless, and supreme.\u201d\n(Prashna Upanishad 5:1,2,5,7) \u201cWhen a man leaves his body and departs,\u2026let him take refuge in\nsteady concentration, uttering the sacred syllable Om and meditating upon me. Such a man reaches the\nhighest goal.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 8:12, 13) You can\u2019t get more detailed\u2013or more authoritative\u2013than that.\n\u201cTherefore should his will be fixed on attaining Brahman,\u201d concludes this verse. For as Krishna said:\n\u201cWhen a yogi has meditated upon me unceasingly for many years, with an undistracted mind, I am\neasy of access to him, because he is always absorbed in me.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 8:14)\nThis is the way.\n\nThe Self Within\n\u201cThe Self, who is to be realized by the purified mind and the illumined consciousness, whose\nform is light, whose thoughts are true; who, like the ether, remains pure and unattached; from\nwhom proceed all works, all desires, all odors, all tastes; who pervades all, who is beyond the\nsenses, and in whom there is fullness of joy forever\u2013he is my very Self, dwelling within the\nlotus of my heart.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 3:14:2)\nRejoicing in the Self\nIt can reasonably be felt that the Bhagavad Gita is more important than the upanishads because it not\nonly embodies their teachings, it provides practical advice for their personal realization. This is also my\nopinion, but the upanishads are certainly indispensable for us who seek the Goal. One of their most\nwonderful aspects\u2013and one that I have never heard mentioned in my nearly half a century of Sanatana\nDharma study\u2013is their marvelous ecstatic exulting in the wonder and glory of the Self. Just reading\nsuch joyful declarations produces a powerful stirring of the will towards perseverance in the divine\nsearch. This verse is one such rapturous affirmation and well worth our savoring carefully.\nThe Self, who. The Self is a Who, NOT a What. That is, the Self is a conscious Person\u2013or more\naccurately a person who IS consciousness itself. Of course, the Self\u2013individual or Universal\u2013is not the\nego, a conditioned personality, but a changeless consciousness. It is certainly true that the Self is not\n\u201cpersonal\u201d or even a \u201cperson\u201d in the way we know those terms. It is a transcendent reality, of one\nessence with the Absolute Reality. But it is Conscious and It is Real. This is bedrock truth. Countless\nages of realization are behind this principle. We may not understand it fully or flawlessly, but that is\nonly our human limitation. IT is Eternal Truth. That is the truth being presented in this verse, a truth\nthat brings profound joy to those who realize it. It is said that Shiva sits immersed in the Self, but that\nsometimes he arises and dances, singing: \u201cO! Who I am! Who I am!\u201d\nIs to be realized. We REALIZE the Self, we do not \u201cfind\u201d It because it is ever present\u2013It is us. That is,\nwe enter into and experience our eternal nature. We have always had it, but have lost touch with it.\nThere is nothing to reach out for; rather we need to regain perception of it. It is more \u201chere and now\u201d\nthan anything else, because It IS the Here and Now. It is only a matter of seeing, of experiencing It\u2013and\nnot as an object but as the Subject. Ultimately, it is beyond description, but what can be said is glorious.\nBy the purified mind. \u201cMind\u201d does not mean the sensory mind (manas), or even the intellect (buddhi),\nbut the principle of consciousness itself (prajna). The simile of a mirror is very apt here. Covered with\nthick dust and dirt, the mirror is no more than a lump of earth or a slab of wood. But the more the\n\ndebris is removed, the more things are seen on its surface, until it shines forth in its reflective nature. In\nthe same way our consciousness\u2013or rather the \u201cglass\u201d that covers it\u2013must be cleansed so there is no\nobstruction to our perception of the Self. That is why Jesus said: \u201cBlessed are those that are pure\n(katharos: clean, clear, pure) at the center of their being (kardia: heart, core, center), for they shall see\nGod.\u201d (Matthew 5:8) And Saint John said: \u201cEvery man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,\neven as he is pure.\u201d (I John 3:3) The path of this necessary purification is fully outlined in the Yoga\nSutras (Yoga Darshan) of Patanjali.\nAnd the illumined consciousness. The Self is consciousness that is swayam prakash\u2013self illumined.\nThat is, Its very nature is Light (Jyoti). By Its presence it illuminates all its upadhis\u2013Its various bodies.\nBeing Life as well as Light, it also makes them \u201clive\u201d through Its nearness to them, just as the presence\nof Brahman makes the worlds \u201calive.\u201d But it, too, is illumined and enlivened by its essential unity with\nthe Supreme Light, the Supreme Life: Brahman. So it both illumines and is illumined.\nWhose form is light. The word Form should really be in quotes, for neither Brahman nor the Atman\nhave a form in the way that is understood in relative existence. Their nature is Light, and although they\nare inaccessible to the senses, in a mysterious way they can be perceived or intuited as Light. I once\nheard a great yogi of India speaking of how it was possible to \u201csee\u201d the Self as a blinding light that\nsoothed rather than burned the eyes. \u201cSuppose a thousand suns should rise together into the sky: such is\nthe glory of the Shape of Infinite God.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 11:12)\nWhose thoughts are true. Actually, the word is satyasankalpa, which means a lot more than \u201ctrue\nthoughts.\u201d For after all, God does not have thoughts, because He has no mind\u2013and the same is true of\nthe Self. A being that knows does not need to think\u2013actually cannot think. Sankalpa means an act of\nwill, resolution, or intention. This is the nearest we can get to some idea of the movement of\nconsciousness that takes place when God wills or determines something. So we will have to leave it\nthere. Whatever it may be in the consciousness of Brahman, the upanishad assures us that it is always\nSat\u2013absolutely true or real. True, in the sense that it is in total keeping with the nature of Brahman; real,\nin the sense that is always results in something. \u201cSo shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth:\nit shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the\nthing whereto I sent it.\u201d (Isaiah 55:11)\nWho, like the ether, remains pure and unattached. This divine Self is said to be akashatma, which\nShankara defines as: \u201cone whose nature is like that of space\u2026all pervasive, subtle, and free from\nform.\u201d Just as the sky contains suns, planets, atmosphere, clouds, smoke, and suchlike, yet is utterly\nuntouched and unaffected by them, so the Self is free from any effects from its continuous rebirths and\ntheir experiences. The Self has no karma or conditionings, and so is like the ether at all times.\nFrom whom proceed all works. It is a fundamental tenet of the upanishads and the Gita that the Self\nnever acts. So when the upanishad uses the term sarvakarma\u2013\u201call karma\u201d\u2013it is to be taken in the\ncontext of Sankhya, the philosophy behind them. Sankhya declares that all action takes place only\nthrough the proximity of the Self. That the energy bodies (prakriti) in which the Self is encased are like\nthe iron that is heated and expands through the nearness of fire, or like the globes so popular at state\nfairs in which the little flags rotate because of light shining on them. So all actions occur through the\npresence of the Self, but are not done by the Self.\nAll desires. All movements of will or intention (the higher nature of \u201cdesire\u201d) are made possible by the\nSelf, by Its transforming influence. But, as with action, the Self does not produce them.\nAll odors, all tastes. The same is true of the senses and the impressions they convey to the mind. The\nSelf causes them to function and be perceived\u2013again, not through actually \u201cmaking\u201d them happen, but\n\nthrough simply being there. The prime idea in these three phrases is that all \u201clife\u201d takes place through\nthe Self being present. The Self does not \u201clive\u201d in a relative sense, but is the \u201clife-giver\u201d in the ultimate\nsense. This is but part of Its wonder.\nWho pervades all. This underscores what has just been said. It is the all-pervasive Presence of the Self\nthat causes all phenomena to occur.\nWho is beyond the senses. This is said over and over in the scriptures, but it is put here within the\ncontext of the realization of the Self. We must turn inward to find the Self, and in that turning we must\nget beyond the senses. Those who are finding God do not abound in visions, chills, levitations,\nrevelations, surging of energies, cataclysmic experiences, sweepings of emotions, and all such that are\nnothing but distractions that can NEVER lead to Reality. All phenomena must be left far behind, and\nwe must \u201cwalk in the sky\u201d that is free of all clouds\u2013we must expand into consciousness that is free\nfrom all types of \u201cexperience\u201d and even \u201cexistence\u201d in the relative sense. For centuries people have\namused themselves with \u201cmystical\u201d experiences and phenomena, remaining ignorant and earthbound\ndespite their psychic powers and aura of \u201choliness.\u201d We must seek for the One. And to do that we must\nabandon the Many.\nIn whom there is fullness of joy forever. If we could only get this truth through our heads and into our\nhearts! In God alone is the perfection of happiness, love, peace, and all goodness\u2013and in nothing or\nnowhere else. It is, however, not enough to momentarily touch or enter the joy of the Self. We must be\nestablished in It. By that I mean we must totally enter into It, encompass that Consciousness and be\nencompassed by It. When this is done, our realization is permanent. It will never be lost or diminished\nin any way. In the Bible this is spoken of as entering or possessing our \u201cinheritance.\u201d It is forever.\nHe is my very Self. Although we identify with so much from life to life, this which the upanishads have\nso carefully described is our true Self, and that alone should be our identity. This is made possible\nthrough the realization of the Self\u2013not intellectually, but as a state of eternal Being.\nDwelling within the lotus of my heart. Since the Self is there, in the depths of our being: \u201cOnly that\nyogi whose joy is inward, inward his peace, and his vision inward shall come to Brahman and know\nNirvana.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 5:24)\nThe all-encompassing Self\n\u201cSmaller than a grain of rice is the Self; smaller than a grain of barley, smaller than a mustard seed,\nsmaller than a canary seed, yea, smaller even than the kernel of a canary seed. Yet again is that Self,\nwithin the lotus of my heart, greater than the earth, greater than the heavens, yea, greater than all the\nworlds.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 3:14:3)\nThe Atman transcends time and space, is always beyond them. Consequently the Self cannot really be\ndescribed as large or small. It is beyond such dualities, and beyond any attempt at measurement. Why,\nthen does the upanishad say what has just been cited? It is indicating to us that there is nothing which is\nnot pervaded by the Self\u2013there is nothing so small or so large that it is \u201coutside\u201d of the Self. Rather, the\nSelf encompasses all relative being as well as the absolute. However large or small something may be,\nthe Self is present within it to the fullest degree.\n(\u201cThe kernel of a canary seed\u201d is not a reference to bird seed, but to the Shyamaka seed that is\nextremely small and its kernel is infinitesimal.)\nThe Self encompasses all worlds\u2013all levels of creation. In modern times we know that the physical\n\nuniverse is beyond all conception, it is so vast. Even so, the Self is much greater. But this is true only\nbecause It is part of the Supreme Self Who spoke through Krishna to Arjuna, saying: \u201cBut what need\nhave you, Arjuna, to know this huge variety? Know only that I exist, and that one atom of myself\nsustains the universe.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 10:42)\nThe Self is within our heart, and within that Self is contained all the worlds. So we carry Infinity within\nourselves. No wonder the pinnacle of the spiritual quest is called self-realization.\nThe great summing-up\nNow the upanishad wraps and sums it all up, saying: \u201cHe from whom proceed all works, all desires, all\nodors, all tastes; who pervades all, who is beyond the senses, and in whom there is fullness of joy\nforever\u2013he, the heart-enshrined Self, is verily Brahman. I, who worship the Self within the lotus of my\nheart, will attain him at death. He who worships him, and puts his trust in him, shall surely attain him.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 3:14:4a) It is those who \u201cworship\u201d the Self by constantly being intent on the\nSelf through the inward focusing of their japa and meditation of Om, that will shed all false identities\nand enter into the truth of the Self\u2013if not in this life, then at the time of leaving the body and ascending\ninto higher consciousness.\nEven the upanishads recognize the value of citing spiritual authorities, for the second half of this verse\nsays: \u201cSaid the seer Sandilya: At the moment of death a knower of Brahman should meditate on the\nfollowing truths: Thou art imperishable. Thou art the changeless Reality. Thou art the source of life.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 3:14:4b) This is possible for those who have made Self-knowledge the central\nand paramount factor of their life\u2019s work. Those who have come to know the Self through profound\nmeditation and constant remembrance of Om, will then know that they are imperishable, changeless,\nand Life itself.\nKrishna\nThen a most interesting statement is made: \u201cThis highest knowledge, the knowledge of Brahman,\nhaving drunk of which one never thirsts, did Ghora Angirasa teach to Krishna, the son of Devaki.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 3:17:6) By this we know that Krishna himself is the embodiment of the\nupanishadic wisdom, and was therefore qualified to give the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, which has\nbeen called the cream and the essence of the upanishads.\n\nSatyakama\nNow we come to a very interesting part of the Chandogya Upanishad which consists of stories of\nseekers who came to know Brahman.\nA feature that will seem odd to Western readers is the instruction of some of the seekers by animals and\neven by the forces of nature. Any explanation I might give is purely speculative and not worth much,\nbut here they are:\n1. The accounts are simply symbolic parables, the animals and nature forces symbolizing powers\nwithin the yogis.\n2. These are not actual events, but dreams which the yogis had\u2013this, too, is a matter of symbolism.\n3. They are intuitions occurring to the yogis as they pondered the animals and the natural forces,\nwanting to understand the ideas behind them\u2013for the universe is entirely ideational in nature. I\ndo not think that any of these are very satisfactory, so I prefer to just focus on the spiritual\n\nteaching and let the rest go by, the way we crack the shell and throw it away, keeping the nut\ninside which is nourishing. One thing is, evident, though, the pure-hearted will be instructed by\nother means if human teachers fail to do so (or even be available).\nTruthfulness (satya), a foundation of yoga, is taught here in the story of Satyakama.\nA case of identity\n\u201cOne day the boy Satyakama came to his mother and said: \u2018Mother, I want to be a religious\nstudent [brahmachari]. What is my family name [gotra]?\u2019 \u2018My son,\u2019 replied his mother, \u2018I do not\nknow. In my youth I was a servant and worked in many places. I do not know who was your\nfather. I am Jabala, and you are Satyakama. Call yourself Satyakama Jabala.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya\nUpanishad 4:4:1, 2)\nThis is no small thing. At the time of Satyakama it was essential for the teacher (acharya) to know the\ncaste of the student, for the instruction given was according to the student\u2019s caste so as to prepare him\nfor his distinctive life within the society of that era. In this way children were prepared to live the life\nof Brahmin priests and teachers, Kshatriya administrators and warriors, and Vaishya artisans and\nmerchants. (Shudras\u2013servants\u2013were not accepted in the schools, since education was deemed pointless\nfor their mode of life.) It is true that in very ancient times a student\u2019s caste was finally determined\nduring his education, according to his aptitudes and inclinations, but he started out being considered of\nthe caste of his parents. Later caste was solely a matter of heredity. Whichever era this story took place\nin, the father\u2019s caste had to be known.\nComplicating the whole thing was the matter of gotra. Gotra means clan, family, or lineage, and all the\ncastes were divided in gotras. This, too, could determine what the student would be taught, because\ndifferent gotras had their own dharma shastras\u2013scriptures which set forth the social and religious rules\nfor members of that gotra. Sometimes these texts governed such minutiae as the student\u2019s style of hair,\nmode and color of clothing, and even the type of wood their staff should be made of and how long it\nshould be. Those born completely outside such a system may consider this all meaningless\ncomplications, but it was not so at the time the upanishad was written, and we should realize the\nseriousness of all this, even if we do not feel the same way.\nAnyhow, Satyakama needed to know his caste and his gotra. Since his mother was a servant, a Shudra,\nhe \u201cshould\u201d not be accepted anyway, and on top of it he was illegitimate\u2013a total bar to assimilation by\nsociety on any level, including education. But Satyakama thirsted for knowledge, and with the singleminded intent of a child dared to approach the great sage Gautama, something even those of highest\ncaste might hesitate to do.\nTruth\n\u201cThereupon the boy went to Gautama and asked to be accepted as a student. \u2018Of what family\nare you, my lad?\u2019 inquired the sage. Satyakama replied: \u2018I asked my mother what my family\nname was, and she answered: \u201cI do not know. In my youth I was a servant and worked in many\nplaces. I do not know who was your father. I am Jabala, and you are Satyakama. Call yourself\nSatyakama Jabala!\u201d I am therefore Satyakama Jabala, sir.\u2019 Then said the sage: \u2018None but a true\nBrahmin would have spoken thus. Go and fetch fuel, for I will teach you. You have not swerved\nfrom the truth.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 4:4:3,4)\nHere we see that character, composed of karma and samskara, was the basis for caste in the upanishadic\nage. Truthfulness is a prime trait of a Brahmin, as is indicated here. Though Prabhavananda translates:\n\n\u201cNone but a true Brahmin would have spoken thus,\u201d the literal meaning is: \u201cA non-Brahmin will not be\nable to say this.\u201d This is extremely powerful, for it not only indicates that a true Brahmin is in such a\npurified state that it is impossible for him to not speak the truth\u2013and speak it fully\u2013it also indicates that\na Brahmin will not have the egoity that would prevent him speaking truthfully and plainly regarding\nhimself in all aspects of his life. For him there is no ego-based shyness or embarrassment of any sort. A\nBrahmin will never seek to hide anything about himself by speech or silence. As yogis we must seek to\nbe perfect Brahmins.\nThe realization\nNow I will summarize what is a rather wordy and sometimes obscure text. (You can read it yourself in\n4:4:3 to 4:8:1-4, and you will see what I mean.)\nSatyakama, at the instruction of his guru, Gautama, lived some years in the forest. During that time,\nfrom various sources he learned in stages that the entire cosmos is a manifestation of Brahman, though\nonly a \u201cparticle\u201d of Brahman. Even though I say he \u201clearned\u201d this, it was not learning in the ordinary,\nintellectual sense. Rather it was direct experience gained in the depths of meditation. Thus Satyakama\nKNEW Brahman, and KNEW Brahman was manifesting as all the worlds, and at the same time\ntranscending them all.\nThe return\n\u201cAt last the youth arrived at the home of his master and reverently presented himself before\nhim. As soon as Gautama saw him, he exclaimed: \u2018My son, your face shines like a knower of\nBrahman. By whom were you taught?\u2019 \u2018By beings other than men,\u2019 replied Satyakama; \u2018but I\ndesire that you too should teach me. For I have heard from the wise that the knowledge that the\nteacher imparts will alone lead to the supreme good.\u2019 Then the sage taught him that knowledge,\nand left nothing out.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 4:9:1-3)\nThis reminds us of the radiant Buddha walking down the road after his enlightenment. Like Gautama, a\nBrahmin met him and also saw the divine radiance and asked him: \u201cWho are you?\u201d Continuing to walk\non, Buddha simply said: \u201cI am awake.\u201d\nAlthough he possessed the perfect knowledge of Brahman (Brahmajnana), Satyakama wisely asked\nthat Gautama should teach him. For he knew that his perceptions might be either incorrect or\nincomplete, and he wanted to check them by hearing from the lips of an enlightened Master. This is the\nway of the wise; they are always aware that they may not have perfect knowledge or experience. It is\nonly the ignorant that insist they know the truth and have no need of testing. As Dion Fortune remarked\nin one of her books, those who are deluded will hysterically insist on the veracity of their \u201crevelations,\u201d\neven being violent verbally and physically in defense of those delusions. On the other hand, a person\nwho has had valid experiences and garnered true wisdom from them will speak of such things very\napologetically\u2013even hesitantly\u2013frequently commenting that they realize their experiences may be\ndelusions or they may be mistaken in their understanding of them even if they are real. Because of his\nsobriety and humility Satyakama was worthy (and capable) of being instructed fully in the wisdom of\nthe sages (rishis). And so he was.\nSuch is an ideal spiritual aspirant.\n\nUpakosala\nNow we come to the story of another student:\n\n\u201cUpakosala dwelt as a student in the house of Satyakama for twelve years. Though the teacher\nlet other disciples return to their homes after they had been duly taught the way of truth,\nUpakosala was not allowed to depart. The wife of Satyakama entreated her husband to finish\nteaching him in order that he might go home like the rest, but Satyakama not only refused to do\nso but went off on a journey. At this Upakosala was so sad and sick at heart that he could not\neat. The teacher\u2019s wife plied him with food, and in everything treated him with tender affection,\nbut to no avail. At last the boy cried out to her: \u2018O mother, my heart is still so impure; I am too\nunhappy to eat!\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 4:10:1-3)\nThe mind of Upakosala\nSatyakama did not let Upakosala return home because he had not learned all that was necessary for\nleading a fully dharmic life according to the scriptural precepts. It is interesting that Upakosala does not\nconsider that his failing is an academic one, but rather one of interior disposition. This shows his\nfundamental worthiness. \u201cMy heart is still so impure\u201d is a misleading translation. The text actually\nsays: \u201cIn this person there are these many desires which tend towards many things\u2013I am filled with\nthem.\u201d (He spoke in the third person because he was objective in analyzing himself. This indicates his\nlack of egotism.)\nThis reminds us of the following from the life of Jesus: \u201cHe entered into a certain village: and a certain\nwoman named Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at\nJesus\u2019 feet, and heard his word. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and\nsaid, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help\nme. And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many\nthings: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away\nfrom her.\u201d (Luke 10:38-42)\nUpakosala understood this (and Jesus must have studied this upanishad in India), realizing that\nalthough desires may not be negative or foolish, yet they pull us in many directions, whirling us around\nand confusing our minds and depleting our life energies. Only when the mind is fixed on the One can\nthe many be safely attended to.\nWhy\u2026\nWhy did the sage leave this boy to his sorrow? Those who see with earthly eyes and think only earthly\nthoughts often accuse the saints of being heartless or even cruel. But they know what they are doing,\nand are aware that their actions are needed. When Jesus told his disciples that he would be leaving\nthem, they were unhappy. So he said: \u201cBecause I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled\nyour heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away,\nthe Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.\u201d (John 16:6,7)\nVivekananda once commented: \u201cA man harms his disciples by staying too long with them,\u201d for they do\nnot develop the independence needed to pursue spiritual life. Swami Sivananda often sent his disciples\naway to engage in spiritual practice or spiritual work. Even at the time of his leaving this world, few\n\u201cold\u201d disciples were present.\nThere was a man who very much wanted spiritual instruction from one of Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s disciples,\nbut that man sent him to another disciple, who sent him to still another\u2013and that one refused him, too.\nBecoming very upset, even angry and bitter, the man left Calcutta and returned home. That very night\nhe awoke, feeling that someone was in his room. Indeed there was: Sri Ramakrishna himself in living,\nphysical form! He touched the man, blessing him, and gave him spiritual instruction. The next time that\nman saw one of his \u201crefusers,\u201d he was told: \u201cWe knew you were destined to receive personal\n\ninstruction from Thakur himself; that is why we did not teach you ourselves.\u201d\nThe teaching\nAnd so it was with Upakosala. Through a voice from the sacred fire Brahman became his teacher. Here\nis how:\n\u201cThen a voice from out the fire which he was tending said: \u2018This life is Brahman. The sky is\nBrahman. Bliss is Brahman. Know thou Brahman!\u2019 \u2018I know that life is Brahman,\u2019 replied\nUpakosala. \u2018But that the sky is Brahman, or that bliss is Brahman, I do not know.\u2019 Again came\nthe voice from out the fire, this time explaining that by sky was meant the lotus of the heart,\nwherein dwells Brahman, and that by bliss was meant the bliss of Brahman. \u2018Both,\u2019 said the\nvoice, \u2018refer to Brahman\u2019; and, continuing, it taught Upakosala thus: \u2018Earth, food, fire, sun\u2013all\nthese that you worship\u2013are forms of Brahman. He who is seen in the sun\u2013that one am I. He who\ndwells in the east, in the north, in the west, and in the south, he who dwells in the moon, in the\nstars, and in water\u2013that one am I. He who dwells in the sky and makes the lightning his home\u2013\nthat one also am I. Know well the true nature of the world that it may never do you harm.\u2019\nThereupon the fire, which had been only an earthly fire with which to prepare sacrifices,\nassumed a new aspect, and became the Lord himself. The earth was transformed; life was\ntransformed; the sun, the moon, the stars, the lightning\u2013everything was transformed, and\ndeified. And thus it was that to Upakosala the true nature of all things was revealed.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 4:10:4,5; 4:11:1,2; 4:12:1, 2; 13:1, 2; 14:1)\nThis is thoroughly clear, and needs no comment, except to say that here we see the nature of\nenlightenment as a total transformation of perception. And that is one of the greatest teachings of this\nupanishad.\nThe final words\n\u201cIn due time Satyakama returned home. When he saw Upakosala, he said: \u2018My son, your face\nshines like one who knows Brahman. Who has taught you?\u2019 \u2018Beings other than men,\u2019 replied\nUpakosala. Then said Satyakama: \u2018My son, what you have learned is true. True also is this that I\nteach you now. Lo, to him who knows it shall no evil cling, even as drops of water cling not to\nthe leaf of the lotus: He who glows in the depths of your eyes\u2013that is Brahman; that is the Self\nof yourself. He is the Beautiful One, he is the Luminous One. In all the worlds, forever and\never, he shines!\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 4:14:2 3; 4.15:1,4)\nNothing more can or need be said.\n\nSvetaketu\nNow we come to the best known and most valued section of the upanishads: the story of Svetaketu and\nhis learning about Brahman\u2013and also his own Self. Prabhavananda has wisely condensed the narrative\nas it contains a great deal of repetition which at one time in India was considered high literary style (as\nthe Pali Sutras of Buddhism show).\nLearning that was ignorance\n\u201cWhen Svetaketu was twelve years old, his father Uddalaka said to him, \u2018Svetaketu, you must\nnow go to school and study. None of our family, my child, is ignorant of Brahman.\u2019\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 6:1:1)\n\nWhat a blessed time it must have been when education was aimed at the attainment of Brahmajnana!\n\u201cThereupon Svetaketu went to a teacher and studied for twelve years. After committing to\nmemory all the Vedas, he returned home full of pride in his learning.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad\n6:1:2)\nYes, yes, yes, we all have read over and over that the Vedas are the basis of Sanatana Dharma, and that\n\u201cbelief in the Vedas\u201d makes one a Hindu. But this is not the perspective of the upanishads or the\nBhagavad Gita. Vedic study is constantly being decried by them as worthless\u2013so what does that say\nabout the Vedas? (Which, by the way, are said to be three, not four.) Just calling them Shabda\nBrahman\u2013the Sound Brahman\u2013does not make them so. (Anyhow, anyone who reads the upanishads\nand Gita knows that OM is the Shabda Brahman!) In the same way in the Bible we find the prophets,\nincluding David in the Psalms, denouncing the ways of the Law and deriding those who follow it. (The\nEssenes declared that the Law, the Torah, had been corrupted and brought into line with the ways of the\nignorant religions of the nations which surrounded and intimidated Israel.)\nHowever we may look at the question, there is no doubt that twelve years of Vedic study had left\nSvetaketu both ignorant and arrogant.\n\u201cHis father, noticing the young man\u2019s conceit, said to him: \u2018Svetaketu, have you asked for that\nknowledge by which we hear the unhearable, by which we perceive the unperceivable, by\nwhich we know the unknowable?\u2019 \u2018What is that knowledge, sir?\u2019 asked Svetaketu.\u201d (Chandogya\nUpanishad 6:1:3)\nHere we have three words: Ashrutam, amatam, and avijnatam that are most important. Ashrutam means\n\u201cthe unheard,\u201d amatam means \u201cthe unthought\u201d or \u201cthe unconceived,\u201d and avijnatam means \u201cthe\nunknown.\u201d They also mean \u201cthe unhearable,\u201d \u201cthe unthinkable,\u201d and \u201cthe unknowable.\u201d These are\nepithets of Brahman, the Absolute Being. Not only do we not at this moment hear, think of, or know\nBrahman, we cannot do so\u2013not through the mind, that is. But we can know Brahman directly at the\ncore of our Self. When we go beyond the usual perceptors into the Knower\u2026then we will hear without\nhearing, think without thought, and know without knowing. For it it will be a matter of BEING alone.\nIn other words, we must be yogis.\nTHE knowledge\nUddalaka now tells Svetaketu: \u201c\u2018My child, as by knowing one lump of clay, all things made of\nclay are known, the difference being only in name and arising from speech, and the truth being\nthat all are clay; as by knowing a nugget of gold, all things made of gold are known, the\ndifference being only in name and arising from speech, and the truth being that all are gold\u2013\nexactly so is that knowledge, knowing which we know all.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6:1:4-6)\nThis is pretty straightforward, but it has an interesting implication. Uddalaka says that if we know one\nlump of clay or one nugget of gold we will know all clay and gold. The Self (Atman) and Brahman are\nabsolutely one, yet the Self is limited in Its scope, whereas Brahman is limitless\u2013and willing to share\nthat limitlessness with us. Therefore the way to know the Paramatman, Brahman, is to know the\nJivatman, the individual Self. Once we know the part we know the Whole. There is more to it than this,\nbecause in that knowing we participate in the infinite Being of Brahman. This is a matter of yoga and\nbeyond the scope of language to express or explain. That is why the Kena Upanishad says: \u201cHe truly\nknows Brahman who knows him as beyond knowledge; he who thinks that he knows, knows not. The\nignorant think that Brahman is known, but the wise know him to be beyond knowledge.\u201d (Kena\nUpanishad 2:3)\n\nIn response Svetaketu says:\n\u201c\u2018But surely those venerable teachers of mine are ignorant of this knowledge; for if they had\npossessed it, they would have taught it to me. Do you therefore, sir, give me that knowledge.\u2019\n\u2018Be it so,\u2019 said Uddalaka.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6:1:7)\nThe ONE\n\u201c\u2018In the beginning there was Existence, One only, without a second. Some say that in the\nbeginning there was nonexistence only, and that out of that the universe was born. But how\ncould such a thing be? How could existence be born of non-existence? No, my son, in the\nbeginning there was Existence alone\u2013One only, without a second.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad\n6:2:1,2)\nIn the beginning\u2013and evermore\u2013there was SAT: Existence; Reality; Being: Brahman, the Absolute,\nPure Being. And this Sat was ekam, evam, adwityam: one only, without a second. This Absolute Unity\nis all that ever has been or that can ever be. This is a major principle of Sanatana Dharma, one that is\nnot easy to always keep in mind since we find ourselves immersed in the experience of duality. But\nwhen through self-purification and the practice of yoga we sweep aside this delusive curtain we will\nsee the One and know It within our own Self (atman) as its inmost essence. The Sat is always One, not\none among many, and is absolutely indivisible. Duality cannot arise in It to any degree.\nThis being so, Uddalaka warns Svetaketu away from the mistaken idea that there was an original\nNothing from which came Something. Certainly, Brahman is No Thing, but that is a far cry from\nNothing. Rather, it is Everything. This is important to us for two reasons. First, if originally there was\nnothing, then when we return to our primal state we will be annihilated, \u201cbecome\u201d nothing. And,\nindeed, there are those who believe and even yearn for this. But it is not so. Second, for us raised in\nWestern religion, it points out the absurdity of the theological principle that God created the world ex\nnihil\u2013from nothing.\nSince this second proposition is merely an intellectual perception, it is not particularly negative, but the\nfirst one is, for it deludes us as to what our ultimate state is meant to be. And it is perfectly possible to\nenter into an empty, jada state of unconscious inertia that can be mistaken for Nirvana, that is often\nwrongly translated \u201cannihilation\u201d or \u201cextinguishment.\u201d\nThe \u201cMany\u201d\n\u201cHe, the One, thought to himself: Let me be many, let me grow forth. Thus out of himself he\nprojected the universe; and having projected out of himself the universe, he entered into every\nbeing. All that is has its self in him alone. Of all things he is the subtle essence. He is the truth.\nHe is the Self. And that, Svetaketu, THAT ART THOU. \u2018Please, sir, tell me more about this\nSelf.\u2019 \u2018Be it so, my child.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6:2:3a; 6:3:2; 6:8:7)\nThis is extremely important. Brahman did not \u201ccreate\u201d anything: It projected everything out of Its own\nbeing\u2013and not as a separate entity, for It is within every thing as its sole Reality, as its Self, as its subtle\nEssence.\nYou might be interested to know that this was the original teaching of Christianity. In the New\nTestament the word translated \u201cmade\u201d in speaking of the origin of the universe is ginomai, which\nmeans to be generated\u2013not made from nothing. It also means to arise or be assembled from something\nalready existing. The expression \u201conly-begotten\u201d is monogenis, coming from the same root word. In\n\nThe Apostolic Constitutions, one of the earliest liturgical texts of Christianity, God is said to have\n\u201cbrought forth all things as from a treasure house\u201d\u2013not from nothing.\nAfter saying all these amazing things, Uddalaka enunciates the highest wonder: Tat Twam Asi: THOU\nART THAT. This is the pinnacle of the Upanishads\u2013of all the wisdom scriptures of India. This\nawesome truth that behind and beneath it all, including our own Self, is THAT, is Brahman. \u201cOf all\nthings he is the subtle essence. He is the truth. He is the Self.\u201d\nSvetaketu asked to hear more. In a sense there was no more, but there could be more affirmations of the\nsingle truth. So:\nThe unknowing\n\u201cAs the bees make honey by gathering juices from many flowering plants and trees, and as\nthese juices reduced to one honey do not know from what flowers they severally come,\nsimilarly, my son, all creatures, when they are merged in that one Existence, whether in\ndreamless sleep or in death, know nothing of their past or present state, because of the\nignorance enveloping them\u2013know not that they are merged in him and that from him they came.\nWhatever these creatures are, whether a lion, or a tiger, or a boar, or a worm, or a gnat, or a\nmosquito, that they remain after they come back from dreamless sleep. All these have their self\nin him alone. He is the truth. He is the subtle essence of all. He is the Self. And that, Svetaketu,\nTHAT ART THOU. \u2018Please, sir, tell me more about this Self.\u2019 \u2018Be it so, my son.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya\nUpanishad 6:9:1-4)\nAll of us in relative existence are enveloped in ignorance. That should not be hard to accept! But\nwhatever the background or past of any sentient being, of whatever level, in dreamless sleep and death\nthey all return to Brahman. But their enveloping ignorance prevents them from knowing Where they\nare, the way a submarine keeps those inside from being wet. So they are not enlightened in any way,\nthough so close to the Light from Whence they came. Although in that state they have no self-concept,\nno identity with their present level of evolution, when they awake from sleep or return from death to\nrebirth, they find themselves in the form that corresponds to their inner development. And of course\nthey immediately get lost in the dream and start wandering around, never really coming to rest\nanywhere. Yet at all times they are within Brahman and ARE Brahman.\nSvetaketu wants more, so his father repeats what he has said from another angle.\n\u201cThe rivers in the east flow eastward, the rivers in the west flow westward, and all enter into the\nsea. From sea to sea they pass, the clouds lifting them to the sky as vapor and sending them\ndown as rain. And as these rivers, when they are united with the sea, do not know whether they\nare this or that river, likewise all those creatures that I have named, when they have come back\nfrom Brahman, know not whence they came. All those beings have their self in him alone. He is\nthe truth. He is the subtle essence of all. He is the Self. And that, Svetaketu, THAT ART THOU.\n\u2018Please, sir, tell me more about this Self.\u2019 \u2018Be it so, my child.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6:10:13)\nNo comment needed.\nSvetaketu asks for more.\nThe all-pervading Source\n\u201cIf someone were to strike once at the root of this large tree, it would bleed, but live. If he were\n\nto strike at its stem, it would bleed, but live. If he were to strike at the top, it would bleed, but\nlive. Pervaded by the living Self, this tree stands firm, and takes its food; but if the Self were to\ndepart from one of its branches, that branch would wither; if it were to depart from a second,\nthat would wither; if it were to depart from a third, that would wither. If it were to depart from\nthe whole tree, the whole tree would wither. Likewise, my son, know this: The body dies when\nthe Self leaves it\u2013but the Self dies not. All that is has its self in him alone. He is the truth. He is\nthe subtle essence of all. He is the Self. And that, Svetaketu, THAT ART THOU. \u2018Please, sir, tell\nme more about this Self.\u2019 \u2018Be it so.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6:11:1-3)\nEverything is alive, but only because the Living Self, Brahman, inhabits it. If that Presence is\nwithdrawn, then death results. Therefore when the Self leaves the body, the body dies, but not the Self.\nYet see how backwards we are in the West. We think that it is being in the body that makes a person\nalive, that when they leave the body they die. Absolutely backwards! Not only that, we continue to treat\nthe body as the person, dressing it up, putting makeup on it, fixing its hair and putting in in a satin-lined\nbox and mourning over it. Even crazier, we will first have drained out its blood and pumped\nformaldehyde into it. Then we put the box in a concrete box in a grave and pile dirt on top of it, heap\nflowers on it, and leave. But we keep coming back to \u201cvisit\u201d the \u201cdead\u201d with more flowers and even\ntalk to the body as though it were the still-living person who has long ago departed from the body.\nNow, if that is not insane, tell me what is? And it is not only sanctioned by our stupid religions, it is\nencouraged by them, especially those that disdain prayers for the departed. Spot the looney.\nMore, says Svetaketu.\nThe subtle Essence\n\u201cBring a fruit of that Nyagrodha [Banyan] tree.\u201d\n\u201cHere it is, sir.\u201d\n\u201cBreak it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is broken, sir.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\u201cSome seeds, extremely small, sir.\u201d\n\u201cBreak one of them.\u201d\n\u201cIt is broken, sir.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThe subtle essence you do not see, and in that is the whole of the Nyagrodha tree. Believe, my\nson, that that which is the subtle essence\u2013in that have all things their existence. That is the truth.\nThat is the Self. And that, Svetaketu, THAT ART THOU. \u2018Please, sir, tell me more about this\nSelf.\u2019 \u2018Be it so.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6:12:1-3)\nThis is easily understood. What I would like to point out is the fact that Uddalaka says \u201cthe whole of\nthe Nyagrodha tree\u201d is in the Divine Essence. It is not part in and part out, as we think in the West,\nbelieving that part of us is material and part is spirit, or that part of us lives in this world and part of us\n\nin the spiritual world. These distinctions are products of ignorance. There is only The ONE. At all\ntimes.\nIn response to Svetaketu\u2019s request, Uddalaka produces another object lesson.\n\u201cPut this salt in water, and come to me tomorrow morning.\u201d\nSvetaketu did as he was bidden. The next morning his father asked him to bring the salt which\nhe had put in the water. But he could not, for it had dissolved. Then said Uddalaka:\n\u201cSip the water, and tell me how it tastes.\u201d\n\u201cIt is salty, sir.\u201d\n\u201cIn the same way,\u201d continued Uddalaka, \u201cthough you do not see Brahman in this body, he is\nindeed here. That which is the subtle essence\u2013in that have all things their existence. That is the\ntruth. That is the Self. And that, Svetaketu, THAT ART THOU. \u2018Please, sir, tell me more about\nthis Self,\u2019 said the youth again. \u2018Be it so, my child.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6:13:1-3)\nFor some reason Prabhavananda did not translate this fully. In the original text Uddalaka asks\nSvetaketu to taste the water from the top, the middle, and the bottom of the bowl. Each time he finds it\nsalty. The idea is that Brahman pervades the entire field of relative existence, AS that field. And we are\nThat.\nYes. Svetaketu wants to hear more.\nTeaching needed\n\u201cAs a man may be blindfolded, and led away, and left in a strange place; and as, having been so\ndealt with, he turns in every direction and cries out for someone to remove his bandages and\nshow him the way home; and as one thus entreated may loose his bandages and give him\ncomfort; and as thereupon he walks from village to village, asking his way as he goes; and as he\narrives home at last\u2013just so does a man who meets with an illumined teacher obtain true\nknowledge. That which is the subtle essence\u2013in that have all beings their existence. That is the\ntruth. That is the Self. And that, O Svetaketu, THAT ART THOU. \u2018Please, sir, tell me more\nabout this Self.\u2019 \u2018Be it so, my child.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6:14:1-3)\nThe teaching here is of major import. We can know we are blind and lost and need to see and go back\nhome, but it stops there. We have to be made to see and shown the way. This can only happen when we\nfind the teachings of enlightened Masters. If we can meet such a Master face-to-face, our good fortune\nis incalculable. Over forty years have passed since I received the blessing and wisdom of the first\nMasters of my acquaintance, and some decades since the last one spoke with me. Yet those memories\nare my heart\u2019s rosary which I can go over and vividly return in memory to those days. I do not have to\nbelieve books: I have seen living embodiments of Sanatana Dharma and listened to their words, many\nof them addressed personally to me. However, I have spent many, many more hours reading the printed\nteachings of some of those great Masters, and many more Masters that I have only \u201cmet\u201d in books.\nHowever the teachings come to us, it is the application that matters. I saw a lot of do-nothings\ncirculating around the Masters who just played groupie until the Master died and then they wasted their\ntime grieving over the loss of something they never really had, and waiting for the Master to \u201cgive the\ngreen light\u201d (a quote from one of them) so they could die and go to the Master\u2019s \u201cloka\u201d and be with\nhim forever. Small chance! They were not really with the Master in life, so why in death?\n\nWhat I want to assure you is that truth is always truth. If you learn mathematics from a teacher or a\nbook it is the same. Further, this upanishadic simile does not inculcate the guru-disciple enslavement\nthat is considered so essential for enlightenment. Yes, one person did take away the bandage and point\nout the way, but notice that \u201cthereupon he walks from village to village, asking his way as he goes.\u201d So\nhe has many teachers, not just one. And it should be the same with us. \u201cLoyalty\u201d to a single teacher\nshould not be a blindfold on the eyes of our soul. All Masters are living, and as Yogananda said, we\nshould realize that all Masters are one and not make differences between them. (He is speaking of\nMasters, though, not just teachers.)\nUltimately, even the teachers are just the mouthpieces of Brahman, of our own ultimate Self.\nAt his request, Svetaketu now receives one last instruction.\nForgetting and remembering\n\u201cWhen a man is fatally ill, his relations gather round him and ask, \u2018Do you know me? Do you\nknow me? Now until his speech is merged in his mind, his mind in his breath, his breath in his\nvital heat, his vital heat in the Supreme Being, he knows them. But when his speech is merged\nin his mind, his mind in his breath, his breath in his vital heat, his vital heat in the Supreme\nBeing, then he does not know them. That which is the subtle essence\u2013in that have all beings\ntheir existence. That is the truth. That is the Self. And that, O Svetaketu, THAT ART THOU.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 6:15:1-3)\nWhen we merge with Brahman in Mahasamadhi\u2013the great exit of death\u2013then all that we \u201cknew\u201d and\nbelieved in is nothing to us: only Brahman remains for us to know and identify with. The long journey\nis over, Reality gained at last. All that was enslaving and misery-producing, all the trivia and folly of\nrelativity, is over forever. No return engagement! No return trip ticket! Home at last; home forever.\nHome in Infinity; Life to a degree undreamed of by us for ages beyond calculation. For the final time\nwe close our external eyes to open the eye of spirit. My grandmother asked me to have a song entitled\n\u201cWe\u2019ll Say Goodnight Here, But Good Morning Up There\u201d sung at her funeral. It certainly is \u201cnight\u201d\nhere and eternal \u201cmorning\u201d in God. But attaining it is not so simple as the song implies. Nevertheless,\none day\u2013beyond all time\u2013it will happen to us all. Then we will really know: That which is the subtle\nessence\u2013in that have all beings their existence. That is the truth. That is the Self. And THAT ART\nTHOU.\u201d\n\nThe Essence of the Mind and Prana\nSometimes the longer upanishads branch off from the central subject and explore a byway or two. This\nhappened in the preceding dialogue between Uddalaka and Svetaketu. Uddalaka began expounding the\norigin of various components of the human being, including the mind, the manas, which is the sensory\nmind, the field of energy which conveys the impressions of the sensory impulses of the brain. It is part\nof our astral bodies, but since it consists of the grossest of astral substance, it is integrated, even\ninterlaced, with the material body and brain. According to Uddalaka the energy of the mind is derived\nfrom the physical body. Here are his words:\n\u201cFood, when eaten, becomes divided into three parts. What is its grossest ingredient, that\nbecomes feces; what is the middling ingredient, that becomes flesh; and what is the subtlest\ningredient, that becomes mind.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6.5.1,2)\nFrom this we see how important diet is, for the very substance of the mind is the essential energy of the\nfood we eat. For that reason we must be careful both as to what we eat and what its vibration might be.\n\nFor example, we should avoid meat, fish, eggs, alcohol, nicotine, and mind-influencing drugs\u2013that\nshould be obvious to the yogi. But we must also be careful about the vibration of acceptable food, for if\nit is a vehicle of negative vibrations it will be poisonous to the mind. When food is cooked or handled,\nthe vibrations of the cook and the handler enter into it, for cooked food is very receptive to vibrations.\nUsually a prayer or blessing will neutralize any negative energies attached to food, but not always,\nespecially if the cook or handler were mentally disturbed. Restaurant food can be a problem for that\nreason, and also because the food may be cooked in the same oil in which meat has been cooked, or\nmay have been touched by meat in some way in the restaurant kitchen.\nPrana, the subtle life force in the yogi\u2019s body, must also be kept pure, as it affects everything in the\nphysical and astral bodies, and has a major influence on meditation, during which the pranas must be as\npure and subtle as possible, since the mental energies and the prana interact with one another\nintimately. About the prana, Uddalaka says: \u201cWater, when drunk, becomes divided into three parts.\nWhat is its grossest ingredient, that becomes urine; what is the middling ingredient, that becomes\nblood; and what is the subtlest ingredient, that becomes Prana.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6.5.1,2) What\nis said about water stands for any liquid, and we must be as careful about that as about our food.\n\u201cHence, mind is made up of food, Prana is made up of water.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6.5.4)\nThen he repeats this, giving examples.\n\u201cOf the curd [yogurt] that is being churned that which is the subtlest part rises upwards and that\nbecomes butter. So also, of the food that is eaten that which is the subtlest part rises upwards\nand that becomes the mind. Of the water that is drunk that which is the subtlest part rises\nupwards and that becomes Prana.\u2026Hence, mind is made up of food, Prana is made up of\nwater.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 6.6.1-3,4)\nThis is extremely valuable knowledge for everyone, but especially for the yogi, as we see that food and\ndrink have a direct effect on the mind and vital force within.\n\nNarada\nNow we come to the account of the great sage Narada and his inquiries made to the great Master,\nSanatkumara. This contains a lot of rhetoric and repetition, so I will omit some of the first fifteen\nsections of the seventh chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad as translated by Swami Prabhavananda.\nThe ladder to reality\n\u201cNarada once came to Sanatkumara and asked to be taught. To Sanatkumara\u2019s question, \u2018What\nhave you already studied?\u2019 Narada replied that he had studied all the branches of learning\u2013art,\nscience, music, and philosophy, as well as the sacred scriptures. \u2018But,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have gained no\npeace. I have studied all this, but the Self I do not know. I have heard from great teachers like\nyou that he who knows the Self overcomes grief. Grief is ever my lot. Help me, I pray you, to\novercome it.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 7:1:1-4)\nThis contains a cardinal truth: there is no peace or real happiness outside the knowledge of the Self\n(atma jnana). Those who wish to end all sorrow must seek that knowledge. Such is the assertion of the\ngreat teachers of humanity.\nFirst Sanatkumara taught Narada the ascending steps of reality which we must perfect before we can\nknow the ultimate Reality: that which we hear from others, the faculty of speech, the mind, will,\n\nintelligence, meditation, and the wisdom gained from direct spiritual experience.\nThe Eternal Truth\n\u201cThen said Sanatkumara: \u2018But, verily, he is the true knower\u2013who knows eternal Truth.\u2019\n\u2018Revered sir, I wish to be a true knower.\u2019 \u2018Then ask to know of that infinite Reality.\u2019 \u2018Sir, I ask\nto know of it.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 7:16:1)\nThere are two simple points here. The first is that only the knower of Brahman really knows anything.\nOnly those that know Eternal Being are jnanis\u2013knowers. This is a necessary perspective for those that\nset out to seek the Absolute, for unless they hold to this outlook they may become distracted along the\nway and settle for less, or even begin actively seeking the less.\nThe second point is that the seeker must ask a qualified teacher for teaching, that it will not just be\ndropped in his hands. Asking is the heart of seeking. An equally important point is implied here: a\nqualified teacher will not teach unless asked. Somewhere I have mentioned that this was one of my first\nlessons learned during my first trip to India. I found that fools and fakes went into teaching mode the\nmoment they saw me and being grinding out the philosophical cliches\u2013along with the hints that I\nshould arrange a world tour for them to end in America the Land of Opportunity. Since nineteenthcentury translations of the upanishads had the teacher addressing the disciple as \u201cmy dear,\u201d these\nignoramuses and charlatans always called me \u201cmy dear\u201d upon meeting me. In contrast, the real teachers\nand Masters were kind and most polite, asking me about my purpose in coming to India and where I\nhad been, and suchlike. But they never said a word about either philosophy or yoga. If I asked them for\nwisdom upon our first meeting, they spoke sparingly in an almost diffident way, in no way pushing\ntheir words at me or trying to impose their views on me. (Some would not even answer the first time\nthey were questioned. One teacher only told me anything after I had inquired three times in a row.)\nAfter more contact, they would become very free with me and answer my questions gladly. But still\nthey never volunteered anything. I always had to ask. This is the mark of a genuine teacher. So Narada\nhad to declare his desire to know Infinite Reality.\nSteps on the path\nNext Swami Prabhavananda gives a kind of digest of several verses.\n\u201c\u2018It is only when a man has realized eternal Truth that he declares it. He who reflects upon it\nrealizes it. Without reflection it is not realized. And only he who has faith and reverence reflects\non eternal Truth. And only he who attends on a teacher gains faith and reverence. And only he\nattends on a teacher who struggles to achieve self-control. And only he struggles to achieve selfcontrol who finds joy in it. Ask to know of this joy.\u2019 \u2018Sir, I ask to know of it.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya\nUpanishad 7:16:1-22:1)\nThis list starts at the top and goes to the bottom, and are the steps to realization according to Sri\nSanatkumara.\nIt is only when a man has realized eternal Truth that he declares it. Only one who has realized the\nEternal Truth of the Brahman-Self can truly declare It. All others just speak rumor and speculation. So\nif we want spiritual authority we will have to seek out those that have found Truth and embody it. For\ntheir very words will convey awakening and empowerment to the worthy hearer. That is why Jesus\nmade the remarkable statement: \u201cThe words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\u201d\n(John 6:63) This is not true of the words of ordinary teachers.\n\nHe who reflects upon it realizes it. Without reflection it is not realized. This does not mean mere\nintellectual thought, just pondering on ideas about Brahman. The word matih means thinking of\nsomething, reflecting upon it because of love, of great affinity, for it. (Shankara says this in his\ncommentary.) The meaning is that the worthy seeker is purified enough in intellect to intuit both\nBrahman and his eternal relation with Brahman. As a result a spontaneous inner \u201crecognition\u201d of\nBrahman arises, along with a reaching out for the experience of Brahman as Reality. Just as a magnet\ndraws metal to itself, so the yogi begins to experience the pull of the Infinite, and loves the drawing and\nthe possibility of the final union. Brahman becomes the most cherished object of his heart, and Its\nreality is never absent from his consciousness. This is a sign of his nearness to realizing Brahman.\nAnd only he who has faith and reverence reflects on eternal Truth. The worthy yogi is not a casual\nweekender, paddling his feet in the ocean of Infinity. Rather, he is one in whom intuitive conviction of\nthe reality of God and the necessity of finding God has arisen. This insight motivates him from the\ndepths of his own being.\nAnd only he who attends on a teacher gains faith and reverence. Actually, the text says nothing about a\nteacher, just the word nishtha, which means steadiness. But Shankara in his commentary says that it\nindicates the steadfast seeking of a teacher\u2019s wisdom \u201cfor acquiring knowledge of Brahman.\u201d So\nPrabhavananda has translated accordingly. We have already considered that we may have recourse\neither to a living teacher or the teachings of a realized Master. It is contact with the \u201cvibrations\u201d of a\nteacher that enable faith to arise in us. Sometimes only the sight of a Master is needed for awakening to\nbegin\u2013even seeing a picture or photograph. Something is stirred deep within, often impressions from a\nprevious life. Wonderful as that may be, it is steadfastness in inwardly and outwardly approaching the\nteacher that is needed for success in our search.\nAnd only he attends on a teacher who struggles to achieve self-control. For disciple means one who is\nengaging in discipline. Things do not come automatically or easily to the seeker. That must be faced.\nAnd paths that pretend to automatically and easily produce realization are fake. Discipline\u2013willing\ndiscipline\u2013is an absolute requisite for spiritual attainment. Otherwise any effort expended is most likely\nto be useless. A lot of cultish seekers labor and slave and deprive and torment themselves and end up\ngetting nowhere. But they are not truly disciplined in the sense of intelligent understanding and effort\nput forth in the context of a viable tradition.\nAnd only he struggles to achieve self-control who finds joy in it. This is a signal trait of the worthy\nseeker: he find joy in the seeking, and rejoices in having at last found the way to real finding. The way\nis one of discipline and purification, and he loves every bit of it, however it may pain the ego, for he\nknows it leads to the end of uncertainty and suffering. Such a seeker does not sigh and grudgingly do\nwhat is necessary, feeling put upon all the way. That kind will not persevere\u2013and good riddance. No, he\nis like the men Jesus told about: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which\nwhen a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that\nfield. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he\nhad found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\u201d (Matthew 13:44-46)\nThey gladly gave all they had. Such are those who find joy in the struggle for self-mastery and Selfrealization. Saint Paul says that Jesus himself: \u201cfor the joy that was set before him endured the cross,\ndespising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\u201d (Hebrews 12:2)\n\u201cAsk to know of this joy.\u201d \u201cSir, I ask to know of it.\u201d Certainly many people seek higher reality as a\nresult of disillusionment and suffering. Some merely seek the cessation of suffering, but the wiser\nactively seek the joy that is the nature of Brahman.\n\nThe source of joy\n\u201c\u2018The Infinite is the source of joy. There is no joy in the finite. Only in the Infinite is there joy.\nAsk to know of the Infinite.\u2019 \u2018Sir, I ask to know of it.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 7:23:1)\nThis is not an easy lesson to learn: that there is no joy outside of the Infinite Brahman; there is no joy\noutside of our own Self. The meditator knows how difficult this his, for the mind keeps running after\nutter trivia in meditation, turning from the way to ananda and thinking of those things that only bring\nsuffering even though the mind delights in the idea of them. Fool\u2019s gold is preferred by the mind to real\ngold. This is an addiction incredibly hard to be cured. The first step is asking about the Infinite, as this\nverse shows.\nExperiencing the Infinite\nWhat now follows is not a definition of the Infinite, because that is impossible since It is beyond\nconceptualization, and therefore beyond words. But it is possible to give a hint about the experience of\nthe Infinite, even though it will be more of a neti-neti (not this-not that) approach.\n\u201c\u2018Where one sees nothing but the One, hears nothing but the One, knows nothing but the One\u2013\nthere is the Infinite. Where one sees another, hears another, knows another\u2013there is the finite.\nThe Infinite is immortal, the finite is mortal.\u2019 \u2018In what does the Infinite rest?\u2019 \u2018In its own glory\u2013\nnay, not even in that. In the world it is said that cows and horses, elephants and gold, slaves,\nwives, fields, and houses are man\u2019s glory\u2013but these are poor and finite things. How shall the\nInfinite rest anywhere but in itself?\u2019 (Chandogya Upanishad 7:24:1,2)\nI know I have said it elsewhere, but I must say it here: nowhere in the entire world can there be found\nteachings equal to those of the upanishads. And these two verses are proof of that.\n\u201cWhere one sees another, hears another, knows another\u2013there is the finite,\u201d can be understood in two\nways, both of which are correct. First, if someone sees anything besides the Infinite, then he is not\nperceiving the Infinite, for when the Infinite is perceived, all else either disappears or is seen as the\nInfinite Itself. Second, if anyone sees anything other than his Self\u2013which is one with the Infinite\u2013he is\nnot seeing the Infinite.\n\u201cHow shall the Infinite rest anywhere but in itself?\u201d This is also true of those who have realized the\nInfinite.\nWhere is the Infinite?\n\u201cThe Infinite is below, above, behind, before, to the right, to the left. I am all this. This Infinite\nis the Self. The Self is below, above, behind, before, to the right, to the left. I am all this. One\nwho knows, meditates upon, and realizes the truth of the Self\u2013such an one delights in the Self,\nrevels in the Self, rejoices in the Self. He becomes master of himself, and master of all the\nworlds. Slaves are they who know not this truth.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 7:25:1,2)\nThe knower of the Infinite\n\u201cHe who knows, meditates upon, and realizes this truth of the Self, finds that everything\u2013primal\nenergy, ether, fire, water, and all other elements\u2013mind, will, speech, sacred hymns and\nscriptures\u2013indeed the whole universe\u2013issues forth from it. It is written: \u2018He who has realized\neternal Truth does not see death, nor illness, nor pain; he sees everything as the Self, and obtains\nall.\u2019 The Self is one, and it has become all things.\n\n\u201cWhen the senses are purified, the heart is purified; when the heart is purified, there is constant\nand unceasing remembrance of the Self; when there is constant and unceasing remembrance of\nthe Self, all bonds are loosed and freedom is attained. Thus the venerable Sanatkumara taught\nNarada, who was pure in heart, how to pass from darkness into light.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad\n7:26:1,2)\nNothing really needs to be said in commentary. What is needed is the resolve to follow the example of\nNarada and attain the same realization.\n\nWithin the Lotus of the Heart\nThe Chidakasha within\n\u201cWithin the city of Brahman, which is the body, there is the heart, and within the heart there is a\nlittle house. This house has the shape of a lotus, and within it dwells that which is to be sought\nafter, inquired about, and realized. What then is that which, dwelling within this little house, this\nlotus of the heart, is to be sought after, inquired about, and realized?\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad\n8:1:1,2)\nThe body is the abode of Brahman and the Self. The core-center of each relative, sentient being is its\nheart. And within the heart is a dahara, a dwelling; and within that dwelling is pure akasha, ether or\nspace. But it is not the akasha that is one of the five primal elements (panchabhuta), but rather the\nChidakasha: the space of Consciousness. In other words, the inmost dweller of the heart is Brahman\nItself. Such is the import of these verses according to Shankara. So it is Brahman \u201cwhich is to be\nsought after, inquired about, and realized.\u201d\nThe inner cosmos\n\u201cAs large as the universe outside, even so large is the universe within the lotus of the heart.\nWithin it are heaven and earth, the sun, the moon, the lightning, and all the stars. What is in the\nmacrocosm is in this microcosm.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8:1:3)\nHow is this possible? Because space, like time, is only a idea, only an experience, not a reality. Infinity\nis within each one of us. I have had various experiences of this fact, but here is an account I wrote\ndown some years ago.\n\u201cWhile meditating one day all ordinary physical sensation vanished. Spatial relation ceased to exist and\nI found myself keenly aware of being beyond dimension, neither large nor small, but infinite (for\ninfinity is beyond size). Although the terminology is inappropriate to such a state, to make it somewhat\nunderstandable I have to say that I perceived an infinity of worlds \u2018within\u2019 me. Suns\u2013some solo and\nothers surrounded by planets\u2013glimmered inside my spaceless space. Not that I saw the light, but I felt\nor intuited it. Actually, I did not \u2018see\u2019 anything\u2013and yet I did. It is not expressible in terms of ordinary\nsense experience, yet I must use those terms. I experienced myself as everything that existed within the\nrelative material universe.\u201d\nI was experiencing the mirror-image of the cosmos that exists within the Chidakasha in the heart. No\none had ever told me about this, so at first I was at a loss to figure it out. But then in a moment the truth\nflashed into my mind. When much later I read these words of the Chandogya Upanishad I realized how\namazing and invaluable is yoga. The yogi can realize for himself the things written in the wisdom texts\nof India. He can both experience and understand the meaning of the experience\u2013and all from within.\n\nAnd yet\u2026\n\u201cAll things that exist, all beings and all desires, are in the city of Brahman; what then becomes\nof them when old age approaches and the body dissolves in death? Though old age comes to the\nbody, the lotus of the heart does not grow old. At death of the body, it does not die. The lotus of\nthe heart, where Brahman exists in all his glory\u2013that, and not the body, is the true city of\nBrahman. Brahman, dwelling therein, is untouched by any deed, ageless, deathless, free from\ngrief, free from hunger and from thirst. His desires are right desires, and his desires are\nfulfilled.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8:1:4,5)\nThe mystic Angelus Silesius wrote that if he could die, then God would die; that if he could cease to\nexist, God would cease to exist. Such was his absolute understanding of the identity of the Self and\nGod. Since this is so, the upanishad tells us that the Immortal is within us, whatever the condition of the\nbody. Moreover, the desires of that Self are satyakama, true desires, and Its will is satyasankalpa, true\nwill. So if we will center our consciousness in the Self, we will not have worry about desire or will\u2013\nthey will be Sat: revealers of the Real.\nTrue desire and will\nHaving spoken of true desire and true will as properties of the Self, the upanishad now outlines the\npractical aspect of such.\n\u201cAs here on earth all the wealth that one earns is but transitory, so likewise transitory are the\nheavenly enjoyments acquired by the performance of sacrifices. Therefore those who die\nwithout having realized the Self and its right desires find no permanent happiness in any world\nto which they go; while those who have realized the Self and its right desires find permanent\nhappiness everywhere.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8:1:6)\nThe desires and intentions of those who have not realized the Self, even if seemingly fulfilled,\neventually evaporate and come to nothing. But it is vastly different for those who know the Self and act\nand will accordingly.\n\u201cIf the sage desires to see his fathers of the spirit-world, lo, his fathers come to meet him. In\ntheir company he is happy.\n\u201cAnd if he desires to see his mothers of the spirit-world, lo, his mothers come to meet him. In\ntheir company he is happy.\n\u201cAnd if he desires to see his brothers of the spirit-world, lo, his brothers come to meet him. In\ntheir company he is happy.\n\u201cAnd if he desires to see his sisters of the spirit-world, lo, his sisters come to meet him. In their\ncompany he is happy.\n\u201cAnd if he desires to see his friends of the spirit-world, lo, his friends come to meet him. In\ntheir company he is happy.\n\u201cAnd if he desires heavenly perfumes and garlands, lo, heavenly perfumes and garlands come to\nhim. In their possession he is happy.\n\u201cAnd if he desires heavenly food and drink, lo, heavenly food and drink come to him. In their\npossession he is happy.\n\n\u201cAnd if he desires heavenly song and music, lo, heavenly song and music come to him. In their\npossession he is happy.\n\u201cIndeed, whatsoever such a knower of Brahman may desire, straightway it is his; and having\nobtained it, he is exalted of men.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8:2:1-10)\nThis is lengthy and perhaps not too obvious of meaning. The idea is that the realized person has access\nto and embodies all that is positive from his past lives, both persons and karmic conditions. This being\nso, he can obtain anything he desires and wills in the present and the future. Yet \u201che is exalted of men\u201d\nin a different manner than the dead and departed \u201cgreats\u201d of human history. He is exalted in the Self, in\nBrahman, in Absolute Being.\nThe hallmark of Sanatana Dharma is its thorough practicality, its good sense, and its demonstrable\ntruth. So the upanishad next says:\nThe obstacle and its removal\n\u201cThe fulfillment of right desires is within reach of everyone, but a veil of illusion obstructs the\nignorant. That is why, though they desire to see their dead, their beloved, they cannot see them.\n\u201cDo we wish for our beloved, among the living or among the dead, or is there aught else for\nwhich we long, yet, for all our longing, do not obtain? lo, all shall be ours if we but dive deep\nwithin, even to the lotus of the heart, where dwells the Lord. Yea, the object of every right\ndesire is within our reach, though unseen, concealed by a veil of illusion.\n\u201cAs one not knowing that a golden treasure lies buried beneath his feet, may walk over it again\nand again, yet never find it, so all beings live every moment in the city of Brahman, yet never\nfind him, because of the veil of illusion by which he is concealed.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad\n8:3:1,2)\nMeditation is the key to the treasure house! So the upanishad next says:\n\u201cThe Self resides within the lotus of the heart. Knowing this, devoted to the Self, the sage enters\ndaily that holy sanctuary.\n\u201cAbsorbed in the Self, the sage is freed from identity with the body and lives in blissful\nconsciousness. The Self is the immortal, the fearless; the Self is Brahman. This Brahman is\neternal Truth.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8:3:3,4)\nOm!\n\nCrossing the Boundary\nThe Boundary-Self\n\u201cThe Self within the heart is like a boundary which divides the world from THAT. Day and\nnight cross not that boundary, nor old age, nor death; neither grief nor pleasure, neither good\nnor evil deeds. All evil shuns THAT. For THAT is free from impurity: by impurity can it never\nbe touched.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8:4:1)\nSetuh literally means a dam. In the experience of conditioned beings within the realm of relativity, the\nindividual Self or jivatman acts as a boundary between Its Supreme Self, Brahman, the Paramatman,\nand the world of samsara. This is a very interesting fact, made even more interesting by the fact that I\n\nhave never encountered it except here in this section of the Chandogya Upanishad.\nWe may think of the Self as a sea wall. On one side is the vast ocean of Brahman, and on the other side\nis the \u201cearth\u201d of material form and change. On one side the wall is experiencing the wetness of the sea,\nand on the other the dryness of earth. That in which the individual finds himself immersed only applies\nto that \u201cside\u201d of his being. However much we may experience birth, death, change, and all that attends\nthem, they never touch the realm of Brahman. Conversely, although we are living in\u2013and as\u2013Brahman,\nsamsara never touches that. Samsara and Brahman are mutually exclusive of one another. But we\nparticipate in the \u201cworlds\u201d of both, in a sense linking them with one another. Presently we are centered\nin samsara, experiencing our own Self as a barrier to Reality. But that barrier can be crossed, so the\nupanishad continues:\n\u201cWherefore he who has crossed that boundary, and has realized the Self, if he is blind, ceases to\nbe blind; if he is wounded, ceases to be wounded; if he is afflicted, ceases to be afflicted. When\nthat boundary is crossed, night becomes day; for the world of Brahman is light itself.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 8:4:2)\nThat is so powerful and obvious that there is no place for comment, other than to point out that the\nconditions listed from which the knowers of the Self are freed are really only illusions, just mirages.\nThe Self being Real, such illusions vanish when It is known.\nThe way across the boundary\n\u201cAnd that world of Brahman is reached by those who practice continence [brahmacharya]. For\nthe knower of eternal truth knows it through continence. And what is known as worship [yajna],\nthat also is continence. For a man worships the Lord by continence, and thus attains him.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 8:4:3; 8:5:1)\nYou cannot get more clear than this! Brahmacharya is THE way to the realm of Brahman\n(Brahmaloka). Certainly, sexual continence is the core of brahmacharya, but it is really self-restraint on\nall levels\u2013discipline. This is it: there is no other way to qualify for union with Brahman than through\nbrahmacharya. Yoga is an essential for that union, but frankly the practice of yoga is worthless without\nbrahmacharya. The proof of that is the American and European yoga \u201cscenes.\u201d Nothing is coming of it\nspiritually, only profiteering and self-delusion.\nBrahmacharya is the necessary worship-sacrifice to know God. As the Beloved Disciple wrote: \u201cEvery\nman that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.\u201d (I John 3:3) Why claim to follow\nSanatana Dharma if the teachings of the upanishads and the Gita are not followed, but ignored and\ndespised-degraded?\nBut there is more.\nLiberation\n\u201cWhat is called salvation is really continence. For through continence man is freed from\nignorance. And what is known as the vow of silence, that too is continence. For a man through\ncontinence realizes the Self and lives in quiet contemplation.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8:5:2)\nPerhaps I should explain a bit about this fulsome assurance that brahmacharya will accomplish\neverything.\nWe, like God, are incarnate in a field of energy which we are intended to evolve just as God evolves the\n\ncosmos. When the evolution is completed, that is enlightenment and liberation. This process requires\nthe total application of the inner and outer powers (energies) of the individual, powers that are\ndevastatingly dissipated through sensory experience, emotion, and desire\u2013especially lust. It is like a\nmachine that requires a certain amount of voltage, or an engine that cannot run without the right\namount of fuel. This is a purely pragmatic proposition, having nothing to do with concepts of right,\nwrong, good, bad, or any kind of moral valuation. For example, sex is not dirty, it is destructive.\nAnything that diverts or dissipates the powers needed for evolution-enlightenment is to be avoided. It is\nnot a \u201csin\u201d but a hindrance, a distraction. For this reason the intelligent (buddhic) yogi is at all times\nvigilantly disciplined\u2013in other words, a brahmachari or brahmacharini. Those who do not wish to pay\nthe price of enlightenment are free to pass it by. No one is under coercion. To seek freedom the yogi\nmust be free in that decision (sankalpa) and in the requisite disciplines for success in seeking.\nThe necessity for brahmacharya is an absolute.\nForest-dwellers\n\u201cWhat people call dwelling in the forest [aranyayanam], that is continence.\u201d This is the first\nsentence of Chandogya Upanishad 8:5:3.\nMost yogis have an inward pull to the forest life, to live in the midst of real nature away from the noise\nand poisons of city life as well as the noise and pollutions of human society. The Gita describes the\nyogi as \u201cremaining in solitude, alone\u201d (6:10), and having \u201cdistaste for crowds of men\u201d (13:10).\nWhether this is a samskara or an intuition, it will be found in nearly all serious yogis.\nOne of my best friends was constantly going out into the wilds and risking life and limb so he would\nmeditate far from any other human being. I am not exaggerating about the risks he took. One time he\nwas literally starving, and even wrote a note to anyone that might find his body, saying that it was his\nunwise ways that caused his death, and yoga should not be blamed. He had been taken into the\nwilderness by another man, but he had left his original camp and gone farther into the forest. So when\nthe man came back after some weeks to check on him, he could not be found. As my friend was lying\non the ground, preparing to die, suddenly that man came walking up and asked: \u201cWhere is that\nwoman?\u201d Hardly able to speak, my friend asked his own question: \u201cWhat woman?\u201d \u201cThat woman with\nthe long black hair in the orange dress! If I hadn\u2019t followed her, I couldn\u2019t have found you.\u201d At first my\nfriend was flummoxed, but then he reached in his pack for his photograph of Paramhansa Yogananda.\n\u201cIs that the \u2018woman\u2019?\u201d he asked, holding it out to the man. \u201cYes, that\u2019s her!\u201d the man replied. The\nMaster certainly honored my friend\u2019s forest-yearning, however impractical.\nSolitude is a matter of interior condition. The incredible Russian Orthodox saint, Saint John of\nKronstadt, not only never slept, he was never alone more than two hours in twenty-four. Yet a man who\nknew him very well said: \u201cFather John was always alone.\u201d In contrast are those that go miles away\nfrom any human being and take the whole world and its population right with them. The teaching of the\nupanishad is that Brahmacharya is the way to accomplish true inner solitude and quiet.\nImmortality\n\u201cIn the world of Brahman there is a lake whose waters are like nectar, and whosoever tastes\nthereof is straightway drunk with joy; and beside that lake is a tree which yields the juice of\nimmortality. Into this world they cannot enter who do not practice continence. For the world of\nBrahman belongs to those who practice continence. They alone enter that world and drink from\nthat lake of nectar. For them there is freedom in all the worlds.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8:5:3,4)\n\nSince Brahman is beyond materiality and even any kind of subtle name and form, these verses are\nspeaking symbolically of the immortality-bestowing effects of union with Brahman\u2013which can only be\neffected by those that practice brahmacharya. (Shankara agrees with me in his commentary.) The\nmeaning is pretty obvious: those who enter the ocean of Brahman and \u201cdrink\u201d will be filled with bliss,\nmade immortal with the Immortality of Brahman, and will have access to all the worlds of relative\nexistence and mastery in those worlds. Those who find the Absolute do not lose the relative, for the\nrelative is a manifestation of the Absolute.\nThe core idea, like the preceding verses, is the necessity of brahmacharya.\n\nDevas and Demons Seeking the Self\n\u201cIt was said of old: \u2018The Self, which is free from impurities, from old age and death, from grief,\nfrom hunger and thirst, which desires nothing but what it ought to desire, and resolves nothing\nbut what it ought to resolve, is to be sought after, is to be inquired about, is to be realized. He\nwho learns about the Self and realizes it obtains all the worlds and all desires.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya\nUpanishad 8.7.1)\nThis is the very heart of Sanatana Dharma: the Self must be known, otherwise all is lost. Sri\nRamakrishna said it quite directly: the purpose of human life is knowing God, so those who do not\nstrive to know God are wasting their life. This is the Truth of truth.\nGods and demons\n\u201cThe gods [devas] and demons [asuras] both heard of this truth, and they thought to themselves,\n\u2018Let us seek after and realize this Self, so that we may obtain all the worlds and all desires.\u2019\nThereupon Indra from the gods, and Virochana from the demons, went to Prajapati, the\nrenowned teacher.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8.7.2)\nThe sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad is devoted to the idea that human beings are divided into two\ntypes: divine (daivic) and demonic (asuras). It should be carefully studied by those who see higher\nconsciousness, for it is bedrock truth. Here in the upanishad we are given an exposition of the two\nnatures by means of a story.\nIt may seem that the gods and demons had a common goal: to \u201cobtain all the worlds and all desires,\u201d\nbut that is not so. It was certainly the aim of the demons, but the gods desired the realization of the Self,\nalthough they certainly knew that \u201call the worlds and all desires\u201d come to a knower of the Self as a kind\nof side effect. As Jesus later said in Israel: \u201cSeek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;\nand all these things shall be added unto you.\u201d (Matthew 6:33)\nThe difference in the reactions of gods and demons can be seen today quite glaringly. Multitudes of\ndemons throughout the world are spouting that \u201cwe are all God\u201d and \u201ceverything is God,\u201d but with a\ncomplete misunderstanding of such statements. For, being entrenched in the ego and material\nconsciousness, they have no idea of the real nature of \u201cwe\u201d and \u201ceverything.\u201d In the same way they\nhave no comprehension of what the divine unity expounded in Advaita (Non-duality) really means,\ninterpreting it according to their own ignorance and limitations, reducing it to a string of childish\ncliches. Demons have a marked facility for trivializing anything, and degradation is their particular\nskill.\nApproaching Prajapati\n\nAnyhow, Indra the king of the gods, and Virochana, king of the demons, both went to Brahma,\nto Prajapati the Creator. \u201cFor thirty-two years they lived with him as pupils. Then Prajapati\nasked them why they had both lived with him so long. \u2018We have heard,\u2019 they replied, \u2018that one\nwho realizes the Self obtains all the worlds and all desires. We have lived here because we want\nto learn of this Self.\u2019\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8.7.3)\nThis verse has a lesson, not very obvious, yet nonetheless important for us. The two seekers lived with\u2013\nor near\u2013the teacher for many years, without asking for what they desired. This is because the teacher\nshould know the disciple and the disciple the guru. When one of my friends, Dr. Mukherji, met his\nguru, Sri Swami Purnananda of Assam, he was astonished at his evident greatness and asked to become\nhis disciple. \u201cNot at all,\u201d the master answered. \u201cYou must come to know me well, and I must know you\nwell. Visit me as often as you can and live with me for as much time as you can manage. Then after\nthree years of observing each other we can talk about you learning yoga from me.\u201d What a contrast\nwith the drum-beating, self-promoting gurus of today, including those that pretend to have high\nstandards for accepting disciples, but really try to ensnare everyone their eyes rest upon. And here we\nsee that Indra and Virochana after thirty-two years had not even brought up the subject of instruction.\n(We need not take so long, but we should be very careful and not rush into accepting the teachings of\nanyone. That is one of the value of books. We can read them and discard them if we find them\nworthless without any conflict with the teacher. And we can apply them without becoming the teacher\u2019s\nslave or dependent on him.)\nNow we observe the first step in the discovery of the nature of the Self. It is not uncommon in the\nancient texts for the truth to be presented as a kind of ladder, starting with either a dim perception of the\ntruth or even a complete misunderstanding and leading upward bit by bit until the complete truth is\ncomprehended. Just why this was done has not been said. Perhaps it was to show that even mistaken or\npartial ideas were to be seen as steps on the way to perfect understanding. Or it may have been as a\nkind of yardstick by which the level of development of a person might be known. On the other hand it\nmay have been a showing of the logical progression of thought on a subject. However it may be, this\naccount is part of that tradition.\nThe body\u2013the Self\n\u201cThen said Prajapati: \u2018That which is seen in the eye\u2013that is the Self. That is immortal, that is\nfearless, and that is Brahman.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Sir,\u2019 inquired the disciples, \u2018is that the Self which is seen reflected in the water, or in a\nmirror?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018The Self is indeed seen reflected in these,\u2019 was the reply.\n\u201cThen Prajapati added, \u2018Look at yourselves in the water, and whatever you do not understand,\ncome and tell me about it.\u2019\n\u201cIndra and Virochana gazed on their reflections in the water, and returning to the sage, they\nsaid: \u2018Sir, we have seen the Self; we have seen even the hair and the nails.\u2019\n\u201cThen Prajapati bade them don their finest clothes and look again in the water. This they did,\nand returning to the sage, they said: \u2018We have seen the Self, exactly like ourselves, well adorned\nand in our finest clothes.\u2019\n\u201cTo which Prajapati rejoined: \u2018The Self is indeed seen in these. The Self is immortal and\n\nfearless, and it is Brahman.\u2019 And the pupils went away well pleased.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad\n8.7.4; 8.8.1-3)\nBrahma asked the two inquirers to have experience for themselves, which they did. Notice, that they\nwere the first to put forth the idea that the body \u201cwhich is seen reflected in the water, or in a mirror\u201d\nwas the Self. The teacher agreed. Puzzling as it seems there is a great lesson here. It is better to be\nmistaken on our own than to have the truth imposed on us. I have known of teachers in India agreeing\nto very silly ideas or proposals put forth by disciples because they wanted them to learn for themselves\nthe error of their thoughts. This is absolutely unique to India, and surely one of the reasons why so\nmany disciples have become masters in their own right. It is better for an idea to be ours, even if\nwrong, than to bow to the belief of another, even if it is more correct. The Gita (3:35) says: \u201cBetter\none\u2019s own dharma though deficient than the dharma of another well performed.\u2026the dharma of\nanother invites danger,\u201d and this applies to personal philosophy, as well. Only when we have the\nfreedom to make wrong conclusions will we develop the capacity for right conclusions. Intellectual\nintegrity is of the utmost necessity, however most religionists are opposed to it.\nIndra and Virochana \u201cwent away well pleased.\u201d And this is normal. The whole world is happy in\ndelusions and illusions. So a religion or philosophy that \u201csatisfies\u201d us, \u201canswers all our questions,\u201d and\nin which we are \u201chappy\u201d may be completely worthless. But we need to discover that for ourselves.\nThough their conclusions were wrong, twice in this passage Brahma has told them that Brahman is\nimmortal and fearless. In this way he planted the seed of truth in their minds.\n\u201cBut Prajapati, looking after them, lamented thus: \u2018Both of them departed without analyzing or\ndiscriminating, and without truly comprehending the Self. Whosoever follows a false doctrine\nof the Self will perish.\u2019\n\u201cNow Virochana, satisfied for his part that he had found out the Self, returned to the demons\nand began to teach them that the body alone is to be worshipped, that the body alone is to be\nserved, and that he who worships the body and serves the body gains both worlds, this and the\nnext. Such doctrine is, in very truth, the doctrine of the demons!\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad\n8.8.4,5)\nThe assertion that \u201cwhosoever follows a false doctrine of the Self will perish\u201d is crucial. It tells us that\nthoughts really are things and they lead us to a revelation of their nature: if false, to confusion and\ndelusion, and if true, to the True. Jesus said: \u201cAccording to your faith be it unto you.\u201d (Matthew 9:29)\nLiterally we are creating the world of our personal life sphere. As we think it to be, so it will tend to be,\nthough much depends on the strength of our mind and the intensity put forth in exercising its creative\npower. Brahma let them hold a wrong concept of the Self because they had to discover the right\nconcept for themselves. This is hard for those brought up in coercive religion to accept, but it is true.\nThe nursery rhyme is right: \u201cLeave them alone and they will come home.\u201d But only in the East will this\nfaith in the individual be found. Wherever we find it in the West it is but a ray of the Eastern Light\u2013but\nnone the less valuable for that.\nBody-worship, which is really only body-enslavement, is the \u201cfaith\u201d of those possessing demonic\nnature, and they literally do die for it. When demons think about yoga it is always Hatha\nYoga\u2013\u201cVirochana Yoga.\u201d The myriads of \u201cyoga studios\u201d in the West are the haunts of the children of\nVirochana.\n\u201cBut Indra, on his way back to the gods, realized the uselessness of this knowledge. \u2018As this\nSelf,\u2019 he reasoned, \u2018seems to be well adorned when the body is well adorned, well dressed when\nthe body is well dressed, so will it be blind when the body is blind, lame when the body is lame,\n\ndeformed when the body is deformed. When the body dies, this same Self will also die! In such\nknowledge I can see no good.\u2019 So he returned to Prajapati and asked for further instruction.\nPrajapati required him to live with him for another thirty-two years, after which time he taught\nhim thus. (Chandogya Upanishad 8.9.1-3)\nIn Eastern Christianity they say that it is the nature of demons to fall and never rise, and of human\nbeings to fall and rise and fall and rise over and over again. In the same way it is the nature of human\ndemons to adopt an error and hold to it throughout their life. But it is the nature of devic human beings\nto keep sifting through their ideas, discarding the ones they discover to be mistaken, and using the ones\nthat are true as steps to even more\u2013and higher\u2013truth. Since Indra was not a demon, even before he got\nback to Indraloka he understood the fallacy of identifying the body with the Self. His reasoning is quite\nclear. So he returned to Brahman for another period of time, after which he was again instructed.\nThe astral body\u2013the Self\nBrahma told him: \u201c\u2018That which moves about in dreams, enjoying sensuous delights and clothed\nin glory, that is the Self. That is immortal, that is fearless, and that is Brahman.\u2019 Pleased with\nwhat he had heard, Indra again departed. But before he had reached the other gods he realized\nthe uselessness of this knowledge also. \u2018True it is,\u2019 he thought to himself, \u2018that this Self is not\nblind when the body is blind, nor lame or hurt when the body is lame or hurt. But even in\ndreams it is conscious of many sufferings. So in this doctrine also I can see no good.\u2019\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 8.10.1,2)\nIn the conscious, waking state it is the physical body, including the physical brain, that dominates our\nconsciousness, but in the dream state it is the astral body and brain that come into function and\ndominate our awareness. This astral body leaves the physical body at death, so it is usually mistaken\nfor the Spirit-Self by the various religions. But, as Indra realized, this cannot be if the definition of the\nSelf formulated by the ancient rishis of India is believed to be accurate. We must go a step higher.\nThe causal body\u2013the Self\n\u201cSo he went back to Prajapati for further instruction. Prajapati now bade him live with him for\nanother thirty-two years, and when the time had passed taught him, saying, \u2018When a man is\nsound asleep, free from dreams, and at perfect rest\u2013that is the Self. The Self is immortal and\nfearless, and it is Brahman.\u2019\n\u201cIndra went away. But before he had reached his home, he felt the uselessness even of this\nknowledge. \u2018In reality,\u2019 thought he, \u201cone does not know oneself as this or as that while asleep.\nOne is not conscious, in fact, of any existence at all. The state of one in deep sleep is next to\nannihilation. I can see no good in this knowledge either.\u2019\n\u201cSo once more Indra went back to Prajapati, who bade him stay with him yet five years.\u201d\n(Chandogya Upanishad 8:10:3,4; 8:11:1-3)\nIn dreamless sleep the causal body is dominant, and even in India there are people who try to identify it\nwith the Self, and equate the dreamless sleep state with the eternal state of the Self. This is because of\nthe extreme subtlety of that condition. Here, too, Indra\u2019s reasoning is as clear as it is inevitable.\nIt is significant that Brahma only required a residence of five years this last time. Obviously Indra is so\nnear the truth that a longer time of purification is not required.\nThe Self as It is\n\nAnd when the time had passed, he made known to him the highest truth of the Self, saying:\n\u201cThis body is mortal, always gripped by death, but within it dwells the immortal Self. This Self,\nwhen associated in our consciousness with the body, is subject to pleasure and pain; and so long\nas this association continues, freedom from pleasure and pain can no man find. But as this\nassociation ceases, there cease also the pleasure and the pain. Rising above physical\nconsciousness, knowing the Self to be distinct from the senses and the mind\u2013knowing it in its\ntrue light\u2013one rejoices and is free.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8:12:1,2)\nThis is as inspiring as it is simple: freedom and bliss (not mere pleasure) are the attributes of the Self\u2013\nand of those who know the Self. Therefore Brahma concluded his teaching of Indra with these words:\n\u201cThe gods, the luminous ones, meditate on the Self, and by so doing obtain all the worlds and\nall desires. In like manner, whosoever among mortals knows the Self, meditates upon it, and\nrealizes it\u2013he too obtains all the worlds and all desires.\u201d (Chandogya Upanishad 8:12:6)\nEnd of Chandogya Commentary",
    "Brihadaranyaka": "\n\nBrihadaranyaka Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Madhavananda\nPublished by Advaita Ashram, Kolkatta\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nI-i-1: Om. The head of the sacrificial horse is the dawn, its eye the sun, its vital force the air, its open\nmouth the fire called Vaisvanara, and the body of the sacrificial horse is the year. Its back is heaven, its\nbelly the sky, its hoof the earth, its sides the four quarters, its ribs the intermediate quarters, its\nmembers the seasons, its joints the months and fortnights, its feet the days and nights, its bones the\nstars and its flesh the clouds. Its half-digested food is the sand, its blood-vessels the rivers, its liver and\nspleen the mountains, its hairs the herbs and trees. Its forepart is the ascending sun, its hind part the\ndescending sun, its yawning is lightning, its shaking the body is thundering, its making water is raining,\nand its neighing is voice.\nI-i-2: The (gold) vessel called Mahiman in front of the horse, which appeared about it (i.e. pointing it\nout), is the day. Its source is the eastern sea. The (silver) vessel Mahiman behind the horse, which\nappeared about it, is the night. Its source is the western sea. These two vessels called Mahiman\nappeared on either side of the horse. As a Haya it carried the gods, as a Vajin the celestial minstrels, as\nan Arvan the Asuras, and as an Asva men. The Supreme Self is its stable and the Supreme Self (or the\nsea) its source.\nI-ii-1: There was nothing whatsoever here in the beginning. It was covered only by Death\n(Hiranyagarbha), or Hunger, for hunger is death. He created the mind, thinking, \u2018Let me have a mind\u2019.\nHe moved about worshipping (himself). As he was worshipping, water was produced. (Since he\nthought), \u2018As I was worshipping, water sprang up\u2019, therefore Arka (fire) is so called. Water (or\nhappiness) surely comes to one who knows how Arka (fire) came to have this name of Arka.\nI-ii-2: Water is Arka. What was there (like) forth on the water was solidified and became this earth.\nWhen that was produced, he was tired. While he was (thus) tired and distressed, his essence, or lustre,\ncame forth. This was Fire.\n\nI-ii-3: He (Viraj) differentiated himself in three ways, making the sun the third form, and air the third\nform. So, this Prana (Viraj) is divided in three ways. His head is the east, and his arms that (north-east)\nand that (south-east). And his hind part is the west, his hip-bones that (north-west) and that (southwest), his sides the south and north, his back heaven, his belly the sky, and his breast this earth. He\nrests on water. He who knows (it) thus gets a resting place wherever he goes.\nI-ii-4: He desired, \u2018Let me have a second form (body).\u2019 He, Death or Hunger, brought about the union\nof speech (the Vedas) with the mind. What was the seed there became the Year (Viraj). Before him\nthere had been no year. He (Death) reared him for as long as a year, and after this period projected him.\nWhen he was born, (Death) opened his mouth (to swallow him). He (the babe) cried \u2018Bhan!\u2019 That\nbecame speech.\nI-ii-5: He thought, \u2018If I kill him, I shall be making very little food.\u2019 Through that speech and the mind\nhe projected all this, whatever there is \u2013 the Vedas Rig, Yajus and Saman, the metres, the sacrifices,\nmen and animals. Whatever he projected, he resolved to eat. Because he eats everything, therefore Aditi\n(Death) is so called. He who knows how Aditi came to have this name of Aditi, becomes the eater of all\nthis, and everything becomes his food.\nI-ii-6: He desired, \u2018Let me sacrifice again with the great sacrifice\u2019. He was tired, and he was distressed.\nWhile he was (thus) tired and distressed, his reputation and strength departed. The organs are reputation\nand strength. When the organs departed, the body began to swell, (but) his mind was set on the body.\nI-ii-7: He desired, \u2018Let this body of mine be fit for a sacrifice, and let me be embodied through this\u2019,\n(and entered it). Because the body swelled (Asvat), therefore it came to be called Asva (horse). And\nbecause it became fit for a sacrifice, therefore the horse sacrifice came to be known as Asvamedha. He\nwho knows it thus indeed knows the horse sacrifice. (Imagining himself as the horse and) letting it\nremain free, he reflected (on it). After a year he sacrificed it to himself, and dispatched the (other)\nanimals to the gods. Therefore (priests to this day) sacrifice to Prajapati the sanctified (horse) that is\ndedicated to all the gods. He who shines yonder is the horse sacrifice; his body is the year. This fire is\nArka; its limbs are these worlds. So these two (fire and the sun) are Arka and the horse sacrifice. These\ntwo again become the same god, Death. He (who knows thus) conquers further death, death cannot\novertake him, it becomes his self, and he becomes one with these deities.\nI-iii-1: There were two classes of Prajapati\u2019s sons, the gods and the Asuras. Naturally, the gods were\nfewer, and the Asuras more in number. They vied with each other for (the mastery of these worlds. The\ngods said, \u2018Now let us surpass the Asuras in (this) sacrifice through the Udgitha\u2019.\nI-iii-2: They said to the organ of speech, \u2018Chant (the Udgitha) for us\u2019. \u2018All right\u2019, said the organ of\nspeech and chanted for them. The common good that comes of the organ of speech, it secured for the\ngods by chanting, while the fine speaking it utilised for itself. The Asuras knew that through this\nchanter the gods would surpass them. They charged it and struck it with evil. That evil is what we come\nacross when one speaks improper things.\nI-iii-3: Then they said to the nose \u2018Chant (the Udgitha) for us\u2019. \u2018All right\u2019, said the nose and chanted for\nthem. The common good that comes of the nose, it secured for the gods by chanting, while the fine\nsmelling it utilised for itself. The Asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass them.\nThey charged it and struck it with evil. That evil is what we come across when one smells improper\nthings.\nI-iii-4: Then they said to the eye \u2018Chant (the Udgitha) for us\u2019. \u2018All right\u2019, said the eye and chanted for\nthem. The common good that comes of the eye, it secured for the gods by chanting, while the fine\nseeing it utilised for itself. The Asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass them.\nThey charged it and struck it with evil. That evil is what we come across when one sees improper\nthings.\nI-iii-5: Then they said to the ear \u2018Chant (the Udgitha) for us\u2019. \u2018All right\u2019, said the ear and chanted for\nthem. The common good that comes of the ear, it secured for the gods by chanting, while the fine\n\nhearing it utilised for itself. The Asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass them.\nThey charged it and struck it with evil. That evil is what we come across when one hears improper\nthings.\nI-iii-6: Then they said to the mind \u2018Chant (the Udgitha) for us\u2019. \u2018All right\u2019, said the mind and chanted\nfor them. The common good that comes of the mind, it secured for the gods by chanting, while the fine\nthinking it utilised for itself. The Asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass them.\nThey charged it and struck it with evil. That evil is what we come across when one thinks improper\nthings. Likewise they also touched these (other) deities with evil \u2013 struck them with evil.\nI-iii-7: Then they said to this vital force in the mouth, \u2018Chant (the Udgitha) for us\u2019. \u2018All right\u2019, said the\nvital force and chanted for them. The Asuras knew that through this chanter the gods would surpass\nthem. They charged it and wanted to strike it with evil. But as a clod of earth, striking against a rock, is\nshattered, so were they shattered, flung in all directions, and perished. Therefore the gods became (fire\netc.), and the Asuras were crushed. He who knows thus becomes his true self, and his envious kinsman\nis crushed.\nI-iii-8: They said, \u2018Where was he who has thus restored us (to our divinity)?\u2019 (and discovered): \u2018Here\nhe is within the mouth\u2019. The vital force is called Ayasya Angirasa, for it is the essence of the members\n(of the body).\nI-iii-9: This deity is called Dur, because death is far from it. Death is far from one who knows thus.\nI-iii-10: This deity took away death, the evil of these gods, and carried it to where these quarters end.\nThere it left their evils. Therefore one should not approach a person (of that region), nor go to that\nregion beyond the border, lest one imbibe that evil, death.\nI-iii-11: This deity after taking away death, the evil of these gods, next carried them beyond death.\nI-iii-12: It carried the organ of speech, the foremost one, first. When the organ of speech got rid of\ndeath, it became fire. That fire, having transcended death, shines beyond its reach.\nI-iii-13: Then it carried the nose. When it got rid of death, it became air. That air, having transcended\ndeath, blows beyond its reach.\nI-iii-14: Then it carried the eye. When the eye got rid of death, it became sun. That sun, having\ntranscended death, shines beyond its reach.\nI-iii-15: Then it carried the ear When the ear got rid of death, it became the quarters. Those quarters,\nhaving transcended death, remain beyond its reach.\nI-iii-16: Then it carried the mind. When the mind got rid of death, it became the moon. That moon,\nhaving transcended death, shines beyond its reach. So does this deity carry one who knows thus beyond\ndeath.\nI-iii-17: Next it secured eatable food for itself by chanting, for whatever food is eaten, is eaten by the\nvital force alone, and it rests on that.\nI-iii-18: The gods said, \u2018Whatever food there is, is just this much, and you have secured it for yourself\nby chanting. Now let us have a share in this food.\u2019 \u2018Then sit around facing me\u2019, (said the vital force).\n\u2018All right\u2019, (said the gods and) sat down around it. Hence whatever food one eats through the vital force\nsatisfies these. So do his relatives sit around facing him who knows thus, and he becomes their support,\nthe greatest among them and their leader, a good eater of food and the ruler of them. That one among\nhis relatives who desires to rival a man of such knowledge is powerless to support his dependants. But\none who follows him, or desires to maintain one\u2019s dependants being under him, is alone capable of\nsupporting them.\nI-iii-19: It is called Ayasya Angirasa, for it is the essence of the members (of the body). The vital force\nis indeed the essence of the members. Of course it is their essence. (For instance), from whichever\nmember the vital force departs, right there it withers. Therefore this is of course the essence of the\nmembers.\nI-iii-20: This alone is also Brihaspati (lord of the Rik). Speech is indeed Brihati (Rik) and this is its\nlord. Therefore this is also Brihaspati.\n\nI-iii-21: This alone is also Brahmanaspati (lord of the Yajus). Speech is indeed Brahman (yajus), and\nthis is its lord. Therefore this is also Brahmanaspati.\nI-iii-22: This alone is also Saman. Speech is indeed Sa, and this is Ama. Because it is Sa (speech) and\nAma (vital force), therefore Saman is so called. Or because it is equal to a white ant, equal to a\nmosquito, equal to an elephant, equal to these three worlds, equal to this universe, therefore this is also\nSaman. He who knows this saman (vital force) to be such attains union with it, or lives in the same\nworld as it.\nI-iii-23: This indeed is also Udgitha. The vital force is indeed Ut, for all this is held aloft by the vital\nforce, and speech alone is Githa. This is Udgitha, because it is Ut and Githa.\nI-iii-24: Regarding this (there is) also (a story): Brahmadatta, the great-grandson of Cikitana, while\ndrinking Soma, said, \u2018Let this Soma strike off my head if I say that Ayasya Angirasa chanted the\nUdgitha through any other than this (vital force and speech).\u2019 Indeed he chanted through speech and the\nvital force.\nI-iii-25: He who knows the wealth of this Saman (vital force) attains wealth. Tone is indeed its wealth.\nTherefore one who is going to officiate as a priest should desire to have a rich tone in his voice, and he\nshould do his priestly duties through that voice with a fine tone. Therefore in a sacrifice people long to\nsee a priest with a good voice, like one who has wealth. He who knows the wealth of saman to be such\nattains wealth.\nI-iii-26: He who knows the gold of this Saman (vital force) obtains gold. Tone is indeed its gold. He\nwho knows the gold of Saman to be such obtains gold.\nI-iii-27: He who knows the support of this Saman (vital force) gets a resting place. Speech (certain\nparts of the body) is indeed its support. For resting on speech is the vital force thus chanted. Some say,\nresting on food (body).\nI-iii-28: Now therefore the edifying repetition (Adhyaroha) only of the hymns called Pavamanas. The\npriest called Prastotir indeed recites the Saman. While he recites it, these Mantras are to be repeated:\nFrom evil lead me to good. From darkness lead me to light. From death lead me to immortality. When\nthe Mantra says, \u2018From evil lead me to good\u2019, \u2018evil\u2019 means death, and \u2018good\u2019 immortality; so it says,\n\u2018From death lead me to immortality, i.e. make me immortal\u2019. When it says, \u2018From darkness lead me to\nlight\u2019, \u2018darkness\u2019 means death, and \u2018light\u2019, immortality; so it says, \u2018From death lead me to immortality,\nor make me immortal\u2019. In the dictum, \u2018From death lead me to immortality\u2019, the meaning does not seem\nto be hidden. Then through the remaining hymns (the chanter) should secure eatable food for himself\nby chanting. Therefore, while they are being chanted, the sacrificer should ask for a boon \u2013 anything\nthat he desires. Whatever objects this chanter possessed of such knowledge desires, either for himself\nor for the sacrificer, he secures them by chanting. This (meditation) certainly wins the world\n(Hiranyagarbha). He who knows the Saman (vital force) as such has not to pray lest he be unfit for this\nworld.\nI-iv-1: In the beginning, this (universe) was but the self (Viraj) of a human form. He reflected and\nfound nothing else but himself. He first uttered, '\u2018 am he'\u2019 Therefore he was called Aham (I). Hence, to\nthis day, when a person is addressed, he first says, \u2018It is I,\u2019 and then says the other name that he may\nhave. Because he was first and before this whole (band of aspirants) burnt all evils, therefore he is\ncalled Purusha. He who knows thus indeed burns one who wants to be (Viraj) before him.\nI-iv-2: He was afraid. Therefore people (still) are afraid to be alone. He thought, \u2018If there is nothing\nelse but me, what am I afraid of ?\u2019 From that alone his fear was gone, for what was there to fear ? It is\nfrom a second entity that fear comes.\nI-iv-3: He was not at all happy. Therefore people (still) are not happy when alone. He desired a mate.\nHe became as big as man and wife embracing each other. He parted this very body into two. From that\ncame husband and wife. Therefore, said Yajnavalkya, this (body) is one-half of oneself, like one of the\ntwo halves of a split pea. Therefore this space is indeed filled by the wife. He was united with her.\n\nFrom that men were born.\nI-iv-4: She thought, \u2018How can he be united with me after producing me from himself ? Well let me hide\nmyself\u2019. She became a cow, the other became a bull and was united with her; from that cows were\nborn. The one became a mare, the other a stallion; the one became a she-ass, the other became a he-ass\nand was united with her; from that onehoofed animals were born. The one became a she-goat, the other\na he-goat; the one became a ewe, the other became a ram and was united with her; from that goats and\nsheep were born. Thus did he project every thing that exists in pairs, down to the ants.\nI-iv-5: He knew, \u2018I indeed am the creation, for I projected all this\u2019. Therefore he was called Creation.\nHe who knows this as such becomes (a creator) in this creation of Viraj.\nI-iv-6: Then he rubbed back and forth thus, and produced fire from its source, the mouth and the hands.\nTherefore both these are without hair at the inside. When they talk of particular gods, saying, \u2018Sacrifice\nto him\u2019, \u2018sacrifice to the other one\u2019, (they are wrong, since) these are all his projection, for he is all the\ngods. Now all this that is liquid, he produced from the seed. That is Soma. This universe is indeed this\nmuch \u2013 food and the eater of food. Soma is food, and fire the eater of food. This is super-creation of\nViraj that he projected the gods, who are even superior to him. Because he, although mortal himself,\nprojected the immortals, therefore this is a super-creation. He who knows this as such becomes (a\ncreator) in this super-creation of Viraj.\nI-iv-7: This (universe) was then undifferentiated. It differentiated only into name and form \u2013 it was\ncalled such and such, and was of such and such form. So to this day it is differentiated only into name\nand form \u2013 it is called such and such, and is of such and such form. This Self has entered into these\nbodies up to the tip of the nails \u2013 as a razor may be put in its case, or as fire, which sustains the world,\nmay be in its source. People do not see It, for (viewed in Its aspects) It is incomplete. When It does the\nfunction of living. It is called the vital force; when It speaks, the organ of speech; when It sees, the eye;\nwhen It hears, the ear; and when It thinks, the mind. These are merely Its names according to functions.\nHe who meditates upon each of this totality of aspects does not know, for It is incomplete, (being\ndivided) from this totality by possessing a single characteristic. The Self alone is to be meditated upon,\nfor all these are unified in It. Of all these, this Self should be realised, for one knows all these through\nIt, just as one may get (an animal) through its foot-prints. He who knows It as such obtains fame and\nassociation (with his relatives).\nI-iv-8: This Self is dearer than a son, dearer than wealth, dearer than everything else, and is innermost.\nShould a person (holding the Self as dear) say to one calling anything else dearer than the Self, \u2018(what\nyou hold) dear will die\u2019 \u2013 he is certainly competent (to say so) \u2013 it will indeed come true. One should\nmeditate upon the Self alone as dear. Of him who meditates upon the Self alone as dear, the dear ones\nare not mortal.\nI-iv-9: They say: Men think, \u2018Through the knowledge of Brahman we shall become all\u2019. Well, what did\nthat Brahman know by which It became all ?\nI-iv-10: This (self) was indeed Brahman in the beginning. It knew only Itself as, \u2018I am Brahman\u2019.\nTherefore It became all. And whoever among the gods knew It also became That; and the same with\nsages and men. The sage Vamadeva, while realising this (self) as That, knew, \u2018I was Manu, and the\nsun\u2019. And to this day whoever in like manner knows It as, \u2018I am Brahman\u2019, becomes all this (universe).\nEven the gods cannot prevail against him, for he becomes their self. While he who worships another\ngod thinking, \u2018He is one, and I am another\u2019, does not know. He is like an animal to the gods. As many\nanimals serve a man, so does each man serve the gods. Even if one animal is taken away, it causes\nanguish, what should one say of many animals ? Therefore it is not liked by them that men should\nknow this.\nI-iv-11: In the beginning this (the Kshatriya and other castes) was indeed Brahman, one only. Being\none, he did not flourish. He specially projected an excellent form, the Kshatriya \u2013 those who are\nKshatriyas among the gods: Indra, Varuna, the moon, Rudra, Parjanya, Yama, Death, and Isana.\nTherefore there is none higher than the Kshatriya. Hence the Brahmana worships the Kshatriya from a\n\nlower position in the Rajasuya sacrifice. He imparts that glory to the Kshatriya. The Brahmana is the\nsource of the Kshatriya. Therefore, although the king attains supremacy (in the sacrifice), at the end of\nit he resorts to the Brahmana, his source. He who slights the Brahmana, strikes at his own source. He\nbecomes more wicked, as one is by slighting one\u2019s superior.\nI-iv-12: Yet he did not flourish. He projected the Vaisya \u2013 those species of gods who are designated in\ngroups: the Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Visvadevas and Maruts.\nI-iv-13: He did not still flourish. He projected the Sudra caste \u2013 Pusan. This (earth) is Pusan. For it\nnourishes all this that exists.\nI-iv-14: Yet he did not flourish. He specially projected that excellent form, righteousness (Dharma).\nThis righteousness is the controller of the Kshatriya. Therefore there is nothing higher than that. (So)\neven a weak man hopes (to defeat) a stronger man through righteousness, as (one contending) with the\nking. That righteousness, as (one contending) with the king. That righteousness is verily truth.\nTherefore they say about a person speaking of truth, \u2018He speaks of righteousness\u2019, or about a person\nspeaking of righteousness, \u2018He speaks of truth\u2019, for both these are but righteousness.\nI-iv-15: (So) these (four castes were projected) \u2013 the Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya and Sudra. He\nbecame a Brahmana among the gods as Fore, and among men as the Brahmana. (He became) a\nKshatriya through the (divine) Kshatriyas, a Vaisya through the (divine) Vaisyas and a Sudra through\nthe (divine) Sudra. Therefore people desire to attain the results of their rites among the gods through\nfire, and among men as the Brahmana. For Brahman was in these two forms. If, however, anybody\ndeparts from this world without realising his own world (the Self), It, being unknown, does not protect\nhim \u2013 as the Vedas not studied, or any other work not undertaken (do not). Even if a man who does not\nknow It as such performs a great many meritorious acts in the world, those acts of his are surely\nexhausted in the end. One should meditate only upon the world of the Self. He who meditates only\nupon the world called the Self never has his work exhausted. From this very Self he projects whatever\nhe wants.\nI-iv-16: Now this self (the ignorant man) is an object of enjoyment to all beings. That he makes\noblations in the fire and performs sacrifices is how he becomes such an object to the gods. That he\nstudies the Vedas is how he becomes an object of enjoyment to the Rishis (sages). That he makes\nofferings to the Manes and desires children is how he becomes such an object to the Manes. That he\ngives shelter to men as well as food is how he becomes an object of enjoyment to men. That he gives\nfodder and water to the animals is how he becomes such an object to hem. And that beasts and birds,\nand even the ants, feed in his home is how he becomes an object of enjoyment to these. Just as one\nwishes safety to one\u2019s body, so do all beings wish safety to him who knows it as such. This indeed has\nbeen known, and discussed.\nI-iv-17: This (aggregate of desirable objects) was but the self in the beginning \u2013 the only entity. He\ndesired, \u2018Let me have a wife, so that I may be born (as the child). And let me have wealth, so that I may\nperform rites\u2019. This much indeed is (the range of) desire. Even if one wishes, one cannot get more than\nthis. Therefore to this day a man being single desires, \u2018Let me have a wife, so that I may be born. And\nlet me have wealth, so that I may perform rites.\u2019 Until he obtains each one of these, he considers\nhimself incomplete. His completeness also (comes thus): The mind is his self, speech his wife, the vital\nforce his child, the eye his human wealth, for he obtains it through the eye, the ear his divine wealth,\nfor he hears of it through the ear, and the body is its (instrument of) rite, for he performs rites through\nthe body. (So) this sacrifice has five factors \u2013 the animals have five factors, the men have five factors,\nand all this that exists has five factors. He who knows it as such attains all this.\nI-v-1: That the father produced seven kinds of food through meditation and rites (I shall disclose). One\nis common to all eaters. Two he apportioned to the gods. Three he designed for himself. And one he\ngave to the animals. On it rests everything \u2013 what lives and what does not. Why are they not exhausted,\nalthough they are always being eaten ? He who knows this cause of their permanence eats food with\n\nPratika (pre-eminence). He attains (identity with) the gods and lives on nectar. These are the verses.\nI-v-2: \u2018That the father produced seven kinds of food through meditation and rites\u2019 means that the father\nindeed produced them through meditation and rites. \u2018One is common to all eaters\u2019 means, this food that\nis eaten is the common food of all eaters. He who adores (monopolises) this food is never free from\nevil, for this is general food. \u2018Two he apportioned to the gods\u2019 means making oblations in the fire, and\noffering presents otherwise to the gods. Therefore people perform both these. Some, however, say,\nthose two are the new and full moon sacrifices. Therefore one should not be engrossed with sacrifices\nfor material ends. \u2018One he gave to the animals\u2019 \u2013 it is milk. For men and animals first live on milk\nalone. Therefore they first make a new-born babe lick clarified butter or suckle it. And they speak of a\nnew-born calf as not yet eating grass. \u2018On it rests everything \u2013 what lives and what does not\u2019 means that\non milk indeed rests all this that lives and that does not. It is said that by making offerings of milk in\nthe fire for a year one conquers further death. One should not think like that. He who knows as above\nconquers further death the very day he makes that offering, for he offers all eatable food to the gods,\n\u2018Why are they not exhausted, although they are always being eaten ?\u2019 \u2013 means that the being (eater) is\nindeed the cause of their permanence, for the produces this food again and again. \u2018He who knows this\ncause of their permanence\u2019 means that the being (eater) is indeed the cause of their permanence, for he\nproduces this food through his meditation for the time being and rites. If he does not do this, it will be\nexhausted. \u2018He eats food with Pratika\u2019; \u2018Pratika\u2019 means pre-eminence; hence the meaning is, preeminently. \u2018He attains the gods and lives on nectar\u2019 is a eulogy.\nI-v-3: \u2018Three he designed for himself\u2019 means: the mind, the organ of speech and the vital force; these\nhe designed for himself. (They say), \u2018I was absent-minded, I did not see it\u2019, \u2018I was absent-minded, I did\nnot hear it\u2019. It is through the mind that one sees and hears. Desires, resolve, doubt, faith, want of faith,\nsteadiness, unsteadiness, shame, intelligence and fear \u2013 all these are but the mind. Even if one is\ntouched from behind, one knows it through the mind; therefore (the mind exists). And any kind of\nsound is but the organ of speech, for it serves to determine a thing, but it cannot itself be revealed.\nPrana, Apana, Vyana, Udana, Samana and Ana - all these are but the vital forces. This body is identified\nwith these \u2013 with the organ of speech, the mind and the vital force.\nI-v-4: These are the three worlds. The organ of speech is this world (the earth), the mind is the sky, and\nthe vital force is that world (heaven).\nI-v-5: These are the three Vedas. The organ of speech is the Rig-Veda, the mind is the Yajur-Veda and\nthe vital force the Sama-Veda.\nI-v-6: These are the gods, the Manes and men. The organ of speech is the gods, the mind the Manes,\nand the vital force men.\nI-v-7: These are the father, mother and child. The mind is the father, the organ of speech the mother,\nand the vital force the child.\nI-v-8: These are what is known, what it is desirable to know, and what is unknown. Whatever is known\nis a form of the organ of speech, for it is the knower. The organ of speech protects him (who knows\nthis) by becoming that (which is known).\nI-v-9: Whatever it is desirable to know is a form of the mind, for the mind is what it is desirable to\nknow. The mind protects him (who knows this) by becoming that (which it is desirable to know).\nI-v-10: Whatever is unknown is a form of the vital force, for the vital force is what is unknown. The\nvital force protects him (who knows this) by becoming that (which is unknown).\nI-v-11: The earth is the body of that organ of speech, and this fire is its luminous organ. And as far as\nthe organ of speech extends, so far extends the earth and so far does this fire.\nI-v-12: Heaven is the body of this mind, and that sun is its luminous organ. And as far as the mind\nextends, so far extends heaven, and so far does that sun. The two were united, and from that the vital\nforce emanated. It is the Supreme Lord. It is without a rival. A second being is indeed a rival. He who\nknows it as such has no rival.\nI-v-13: Water is the body of this vital force, and that moon is its luminous organ. And as far as the vital\n\nforce extends, so far extends water, and so far does that moon. These are all equal, and all infinite. He\nwho meditates upon these as finite wins a finite world, but he who meditates upon these as infinite wins\nan infinite world.\nI-v-14: This Prajapati (Hiranyagarbha) has sixteen digits and is represented by the year. The nights (and\ndays) are his fifteen digits, and the constant one is his sixteenth digit. He (as the moon) is filled as well\nas wasted by the nights (and days). Through this sixteenth digit he permeates all these living beings on\nthe new-moon night and rises the next morning. Therefore on this night one should not take the life of\nliving beings, not even of a chameleon, in adoration of this deity alone.\nI-v-15: That Prajapati who has sixteen digits and is represented by the year is indeed this man who\nknows as above. Wealth constitutes his fifteen digits, and the body his sixteenth digit. He is filled as\nwell as wasted by wealth. This body stands for a nave, and wealth is the felloe. Therefore if a man loses\neverything, but he himself lives, people say that he has only lost his outfit.\nI-v-16: There are indeed three worlds, the world of men, the world of the Manes and the world of the\ngods. This world of men is to be won through the son alone, and by no other rite; the world of the\nManes through rites; and the world of the gods through meditation. The world of the gods is the best of\nthe worlds. Therefore they praise meditation.\nI-v-17: Now therefore the entrusting: When a man thinks he will die, he says to his son, \u2018You are\nBrahman, you are the sacrifice, and you are the world\u2019. The son replies, \u2018I am Brahman, I am the\nsacrifice, and I am the world.\u2019 (The father thinks \u2018Whatever is studied is all unified in the word\n\"Brahman\". Whatever sacrifices there are, are all unified in the word \"sacrifice\". And whatever worlds\nthere are, are all unified in the world \"world\". All this (the duties of a householder) is indeed this much.\nHe, being all this, will protect me from (the ties of) this world.\u2019 Therefor they speak of an educated son\nas being conducive to the world. Hence (a father) teaches his son. When a father who knows as above\ndeparts from this world, he penetrates his son together with the organ of speech, the mind and the vital\nforce. Should anything be left undone by him through any slip the son exonerates him from all that.\nTherefore he is called a son. The father lives in this world through the son. Divine and immortal\nspeech, mind and vital force permeate him.\nI-v-18: The divine organ of speech from the earth and fire permeates him. That is the divine organ of\nspeech through which whatever he says is fulfilled.\nI-v-19: The divine mind from heaven and the sun permeates him. That is the divine mind through\nwhich he only becomes happy and never mourns.\nI-v-20: The divine vital force from water and the moon permeates him. That is the divine vital force\nwhich, when it moves or does not move, feels no pain nor is injured. He who knows as above becomes\nthe self of all beings. As is this deity (Hiranyagarbha), so is he. As all beings take care of this deity, so\ndo they take care of him. Howsoever these beings may grieve, that grief of theirs is connected with\nthem. But only merit goes to him. No demerit ever goes to the gods.\nI-v-21: Now a consideration of the vow: Prajapati projected the organs. These, on being projected,\nquarrelled with one another. The organ of speech took a vow, \u2018I will go on speaking\u2019. The eye: \u2018I will\nsee\u2019. The ear: \u2018I will hear\u2019. And so did the other organs according to their functions. Death captured\nthem in the form of fatigue \u2013 it overtook the, and having overtaken them it controlled them. Therefore\nthe organ of speech invariably gets tired, and so do the eye and the ear. But death did not overtake this\nvital force in the body. The organs resolved to know it. \u2018This is the greatest among us that, when it\nmoves or does not move, feels no pain nor is injured. Well, let us all be of its form.\u2019 They all assumed\nits form. Therefore they are called by this name of \u2018Prana\u2019. That family in which a man is born who\nknows as above, is indeed named after him. And he who competes with one who knows as above\nshrivels, and after shrivelling dies at the end. This is with reference to the body.\nI-v-22: Now with reference to the gods: Fire took a vow, \u2018I will go on burning.\u2019 The sun: \u2018I will give\nheat\u2019. The moon: \u2018I will shine\u2019. And so did the other gods according to their functions. As is the vital\nforce in the body among these organs, so is Vayu (air) among these gods. Other gods sink, but not air.\n\nAir is the deity that never sets.\nI-v-23: Now there is this verse; \u2018The gods observed the vow of that from which the sun rises and in\nwhich he sets. It is (followed) to-day, and it will be (followed) to-morrow.\u2019 The sun indeed rises from\nthe vital force and also sets in it. What these (gods) observed then, they observe to this day. Therefore a\nman should observe a single vow \u2013 do the functions of the Prana and Apana (respiration and excretion),\nlest the evil of death (fatigue) should overtake him. And if he observes it, he should seek to finish it.\nThrough it he attains identity with this deity, or lives in the same world with it.\nI-vi-1: This (universe) indeed consists of three things: name, form and action. Of those names, speech\n(sound in general) is the Uktha (source), for all names spring from it. It is their Saman (common\nfeature), for it is common to all names. It is their Brahman (self), for it sustains all names.\nI-vi-2: Now of forms the eye (anything visible) is the Uktha (source), for all forms spring from it. It is\ntheir Saman (common feature), for it is common to all forms. It is their Brahman (self), for it sustains\nall forms.\nI-vi-3: And of actions the body (activity) is the Uktha (source), for all actions spring from it. It is their\nSaman (common feature), for it is common to all actions. It is their Brahman (self), for it sustains all\nactions. These three together are one \u2013 this body, and the body, although one, is these three. This\nimmortal entity is covered by truth (the five elements): The vital force is the immortal entity, and name\nand form and truth; (so) this vital force is covered by them.\nII-i-1: Om. There was a man of the Garga family called Proud Balaki, who was a speaker. He said to\nAjatasatru, the king of Benares, \u2018I will tell you about Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said, \u2018For this proposal I\ngive you a thousand (cows). People indeed rush saying \"Janaka, Janaka\". (I too have some of his\nqualities.)\u2019\nII-i-2: Gargya said, \u2018That being who is in the sun, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said, \u2018Please\ndon\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as all-surpassing, as the head of all beings and as\nresplendent. He who meditates upon him as such becomes all-surpassing, the head of all beings and\nresplendent.\nII-i-3: Gargya said, \u2018that being who is in the moon, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said,\n\"Please don\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as the great, white-robed, radiant Soma.\u2019 He who\nmeditates upon him as such has abundant Soma pressed in his principal and auxiliary sacrifices every\nday, and his food never gets short.\nII-i-4: Gargya said, \u2018That being who is in lightning, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said,\n\"Please don\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as powerful\u2019. He who meditates upon him as such\nbecomes powerful, and his progeny too becomes powerful.\nII-i-5: Gargya said, \u2018This being who is in the ether, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said,\n\"Please don\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as full and unmoving\u2019. He who meditates upon him\nas such is filled with progeny and cattle, and his progeny is never extinct from this world.\nII-i-6: Gargya said, \u2018This being who is in air, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said, \"Please\ndon\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as the Lord, as irresistible, and as the unvanquished army.\u2019\nHe who meditates upon him as such ever becomes victorious and invincible, and conquers his enemies.\nII-i-7: Gargya said, \u2018This being who is in fire, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said, \"Please\ndon\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as forbearing\u2019. He who meditates upon him as such becomes\nforbearing, and his progeny too becomes forbearing.\nII-i-8: Gargya said, \u2018This being who is in water, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said, \"Please\ndon\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as agreeable\u2019. He who meditates upon him as such has only\nagreeable things coming to him, and not contrary ones; also from him are born children who are\nagreeable.\nII-i-9: Gargya said, \u2018This being who is in a looking-glass, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said,\n\n\"Please don\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as shining\u2019. He who meditates upon him as such\nbecomes shining, and his progeny too becomes shining. He also outshines all those with whom he\ncomes in contact.\nII-i-10: Gargya said, \u2018This sound that issues behind a man as he walks, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019.\nAjatasatru said, \"Please don\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as life\u2019. He who meditates upon him\nas such attains his full term of life in this world, and life does not depart from him before the\ncompletion of that term.\nII-i-11: Gargya said, \u2018This being who is in the quarters, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said,\n\"Please don\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as second and as non-separating\u2019. He who meditates\nupon him as such gets companions, and his followers never depart from him.\nII-i-12: Gargya said, \u2018This being who identifies himself with the shadow, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019.\nAjatasatru said, \"Please don\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as death\u2019. He who meditates upon\nhim as such attains his full term of life in this world, and death does not overtake him before the\ncompletion of that term.\nII-i-13: Gargya said, \u2018This being who is in the self, I meditate upon as Brahman\u2019. Ajatasatru said,\n\"Please don\u2019t talk about him. I meditate upon him as self-possessed.\u2019 He who meditates upon him as\nsuch becomes self-possessed, and his progeny too becomes self-possessed. Gargya remained silent.\nII-i-14: Ajatasatru said, \u2018is this all ?\u2019 \u2018This is all\u2019. \u2018By knowing this much one cannot know (Brahman)\u2019.\nGargya said, \u2018I approach you as a student\u2019.\nII-i-15: Ajatasatru said, \u2018It is contrary to usage that a Brahmana should approach a Kshatriya thinking,\n\"he will teach me about Brahman\". However I will instruct you\u2019. Taking Gargya by the hand he rose.\nThey came to a sleeping man. (Ajatasatru) addressed him by these names, Great, White-robed, radiant,\nSoma\u2019. The man did not get up. (The King) pushed him with the hand till he awoke. Then he got up.\nII-i-16: Ajatasatru said, \u2018When this being full of consciousness (identified with the mind) was thus\nasleep, where was it, and whence did it thus come ?\u2019 Gargya did not know that.\nII-i-17: Ajatasatru said, \u2018When this being full of consciousness is thus asleep, it absorbs at the time the\nfunctions of the organs through its own consciousness, and lies in the Akasa (Supreme Self) that is in\nthe heart. When this being absorbs them, it is called Svapiti. Then the nose is absorbed, the organ of\nspeech is absorbed, the eye is absorbed, the ear is absorbed, and the mind is absorbed\u2019.\nII-i-18: When it thus remains in the dream state, these are its achievements: It then becomes an\nemperor, as it were, or a noble Brahmana, as it were, or attains states high or low, as it were. As an\nemperor, taking his citizens, moves about as he pleases in his own territory, so does it, thus taking the\norgans, move about as it pleases in its own body.\nII-i-19: Again when it becomes fast asleep \u2013 when it does not know anything \u2013 it comes back along the\nseventy-two thousand nerves called Hita, which extend from the heart to the pericardium (the whole\nbody), and remains in the body. As a baby, or an emperor, or a noble Brahmana lives, having attained\nthe acme of bliss, so does it remain.\nII-i-20: As a spider moves along the thread (it produces), and as from a fire tiny sparks fly in all\ndirections, so from this Self emanate all organs, all worlds, all gods and all beings. Its secret name\n(Upanishad) is \u2018the Truth of Truth\u2019. The vital force is truth, and It is the Truth of that.\nII-ii-1: He who knows the calf with its abode, its special resort, its post and its tether kills his seven\nenvions kinsmen: the vital force in the body is indeed the calf; this body is its abode, the head its\nspecial resort, strength its post, and food its tether.\nII-ii-2: These seven gods that prevent decay worship it: Through these pink lines in the eye Rudra\nattends on it; through the water that is in the eye, Parjanya; through the pupil, the sun; through the dark\nportion, fire; through the white portion, Indra; through the lower eye-lid the earth attends on it; and\nthrough the upper eye-lid, heaven. He who knows it as such never has any decrease of food.\nII-ii-3: Regarding this there is the following pithy verse: \u2018there is a bowl that has its opening below and\n\nbulges at the top; various kinds of knowledge have been put in it; seven sages sit by its side, and the\norgan of speech, which has communication with the Vedas, is the eighth\u2019. The \u2018bowl that has its\nopening below and bulges at the top\u2019 is the head of ours, for it is the bowl that has its opening below\nand bulges at the top. \u2018various kinds of knowledge have been put in it\u2019, refers to the organs; these\nindeed represent various kinds of knowledge. \u2018Seven sages sit by its side\u2019, refers to the organs; they\nindeed are the sages. \u2018The organ of speech, which has communication with the Vedas, is the eighth\u2019,\nbecause the organ of speech is the eighth and communicates with the Vedas.\nII-ii-4: These two (ears) are Gotama and Bharadvaja: this one is Gotama, and this one is Bharadvaja:\nThese two (eyes) are Visvamitra and Jamadagni: this one is Visvamitra, and this one Jamadagni. These\ntwo (nostrils) are Vasistha, and Kashyapa: this one is Vasistha, and this one Kashyapa: the tongue is\nAtri, for through the tongue food is eaten. \u2018Atri\u2019 is but this name \u2018Atti\u2019. He who knows it as such\nbecomes the eater of all, and everything becomes his food.\nII-iii-1: Brahman has but two forms \u2013 gross and subtle, mortal and immortal, limited and unlimited,\ndefined and undefined.\nII-iii-2: The gross (form) is that which is other than air and the ether. It is mortal, it is limited, and it is\ndefined. The essence of that which is gross, mortal, limited and defined is the sun that shines, for it is\nthe essence of the defined.\nII-iii-3: Now the subtle \u2013 it is air and the ether. It is immortal, it is unlimited, and it is undefined. The\nessence of that which is subtle, immortal, unlimited and undefined is the being that is in the sun, for\nthat is the essence of the undefined. This is with reference to the gods.\nII-iii-4: Now with reference to the body: the gross form is but this \u2013 what is other than (the corporeal)\nair and the ether that is in the body. It is mortal, it is limited and it is defined. The essence of that which\nis gross, mortal, limited and defined is the eye, for it is the essence of the defined.\nII-iii-5: Now the subtle \u2013 it is (the corporeal) air and the ether that is in the body. It is immortal, it is\nunlimited, and it is undefined. The essence of that which is subtle, immortal, unlimited and undefined is\nthis being that is in the right eye, for this is the essence of the undefined.\nII-iii-6: The form of that \u2018being\u2019 is as follows: like a cloth dyed with turmeric, or like grey sheep\u2019s\nwool, or like the (scarlet) insect called Indragopa, or like a tongue of fire, or like a white lotus, or like a\nflash of lightning. He who knows it as such attains splendour like a flash of lightning. Now therefore\nthe description (of Brahman): \u2018Not this, not this\u2019. Because there is no other and more appropriate\ndescription than this \u2018Not this\u2019. Now Its name: \u2018The Truth of truth\u2019. The vital force is truth, and It is the\nTruth of that.\nII-iv-1: \u2018Maitreyi, my dear\u2019, said Yajnavalkya, \u2018I am going to renounce this life. Allow me to finish\nbetween you and Katyayani\u2019.\nII-iv-2: Thereupon Maitreyi said, \u2018Sir, if indeed this whole earth full of wealth be mine, shall I be\nimmortal through that ?\u2019 \u2018No\u2019, replied Yajnavalkya, \u2018your life will be just like that of people who have\nplenty of things, but there is no hope of immortality through wealth.\u2019\nII-iv-3: Then Maitreyi said, \u2018What shall I do with that which will not make me immortal? Tell me, sir,\nof that alone which you know (to be the only means of immortality).\u2019\nII-iv-4: Yajnavalkya said, \u2018My dear, you have been my beloved (even before), and you say what is after\nmy heart. Come, take your seat, I will explain it to you. As I explain it, meditate (on its meaning).\nII-iv-5: He said: \u2018It is not for the sake of the husband, my dear, that he is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake\nthat he is loved. It is not for the sake of the wife, my dear, that she is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that\nshe is loved. It is not for the sake of the sons, my dear, that they are loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that\nthey are loved. It is not for the sake of wealth, my dear, that it is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that it is\nloved. It is not for the sake of the Brahmana, my dear, that he is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that he is\nloved. It is not for the sake of the Kshatriya, my dear, that he is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that he is\n\nloved. It is not for the sake of worlds, my dear, that they are loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that they are\nloved. It is not for the sake of the gods, my dear, that they are loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that they\nare loved. It is not for the sake of beings, my dear, that they are loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that they\nare loved. It is not for the sake of all, my dear, that all is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that it is loved.\nThe Self, my dear Maitreyi, should be realised \u2013 should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon.\nBy the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\nII-iv-6: The Brahmana ousts (slights) one who knows him as different from the Self. The Kshatriya\nousts one who knows him as different from the Self. Worlds oust one who knows them as different\nfrom the Self. The gods oust one who knows them as different from the Self. Beings oust one who\nknows them as different from the Self. All ousts one who knows it as different from the Self. This\nBrahmana, this Kshatriya, these worlds, these gods, these beings, and this all are this Self.\nII-iv-7: As, when a drum is beaten, one cannot distinguish its various particular notes, but they are\nincluded in the general note of the drum or in the general sound produced by different kinds of strokes.\nII-iv-8: As, when a conch is blown, one cannot distinguish its various particular notes, but they are\nincluded in the general note of the conch or in the general sound produced by different kinds of\nplaying.\nII-iv-9: As, when a Vina is played, one cannot distinguish its various particular notes, but they are\nincluded in the general note of the Vina or in the general sound produced by different kinds of playing.\nII-iv-10: As from a fire kindled with wet faggot diverse kinds of smoke issue, even so, my dear, the\nRig-Veda, Yajur-Veda, Sama-Veda, Atharvangirasa, history, mythology, arts, Upanishads, pithy verses,\naphorisms, elucidations and explanations are (like) the breath of this infinite Reality. They are like the\nbreath of this (Supreme Self).\nII-iv-11: As the ocean is the one goal of all sorts of water, as the skin is the one goal of all kinds of\ntouch, as the nostrils are the one goal of all odours, as the tongue is the one goal of all savours, as the\neye is the one goal of all colours , as the ear is the one goal of all sounds, as the Manas is the one goal\nof all deliberations, as the intellect is the one goal of all kinds of knowledge, as the hands are the one\ngoal of all sort of work, as the organ of generation is the one goal of all kinds of enjoyment, as the anus\nis the one goal of all excretions, as the feet are the one goal of all kinds of walking, as the organ of\nspeech is the one goal of all Vedas.\nII-iv-12: As a lump of salt dropped into water dissolves with (its component) water, and no one is able\nto pick it up, but from wheresoever one takes it, it tastes salt, even so, my dear, this great, endless,\ninfinite Reality is but Pure Intelligence. (The Self) comes out (as a separate entity) from these elements,\nand (this separateness) is destroyed with them. After attaining (this oneness) it has no more\nconsciousness. This is what I say, my dear. So said Yajnavalkya.\nII-iv-13: Maitreyi said, \u2018Just here you have thrown me into confusion, sir \u2013 by saying that after\nattaining (oneness) the self has no more consciousness\u2019. Yajnavalkya said, \u2018Certainly, I am not saying\nanything confusing, my dear; this is quite sufficient for knowledge, O Maitreyi\u2019.\nII-iv-14: Because when there is duality, as it were, then one smells something, one sees something, one\nhears something, one speaks something, one thinks something, one knows something. (But) when to\nthe knower of Brahman everything has become the self, then what should one smell and through what,\nwhat should one see and through what, what should one hear and through what, what should one speak\nand through what, what should one think and through what, what should one know and through what ?\nThrough what should one know That owing to which all this is known \u2013 through what, O Maitreyi,\nshould one know the Knower ?\nII-v-1: This earth is (like) honey to all beings, and all beings are (like) honey to this earth. (The same\nwith) the shining immortal being who is in this earth, and the shining, immortal, corporeal being in the\nbody. (These four) are but this Self. This (Self-knowledge) is (the means of) immortality; this\n(underlying unity) is Brahman; this (knowledge of Brahman) is (the means of becoming) all.\n\nII-v-2: This water is (like) honey to all beings, and all beings are (like) honey to this water.

Just as all the\nspokes are fixed in the nave and the felloe of a chariot-wheel, so are all beings, all gods, all worlds, all\norgans and all these (individual) selves fixed in this Self.\nII-v-16: This is that meditation on things mutually helpful which Dadhyac, versed in the Atharva-Veda,\ntaught the Asvins. Perceiving this the Rishi (Mantra) said, \u2018O Asvins in human form, that terrible deed\ncalled Damsa which you committed out of greed, I will disclose as a cloud does rain \u2013 (how you learnt)\nthe meditation on things mutually helpful that Dadhyac, versed in the Atharva-Veda, taught you\nthrough a horse\u2019s head.\nII-v-17: This is that meditation on things mutually helpful which Dadhyac, versed in the Atharva-Veda,\ntaught the Asvins. Perceiving this the Rishi said, \u2018O Asvins, you set a horse\u2019s head on (the shoulders of)\nDadhyac, versed in the Atharva-Veda. O terrible ones, to keep his word, he taught you the (ritualistic)\nmeditation on things mutually helpful connected with the sun, as also the secret (spiritual) meditation\non them.\u2019\nII-v-18: This is that meditation on things mutually helpful which Dadhyac, versed in the Atharva-Veda,\ntaught the Asvins. Perceiving this the Rishi said, \u2018He made bodies with two feet and bodies with four\nfeet. That supreme Being first entered the bodies as a bird (the subtle body).\u2019 On account of his\ndwelling in all bodies, He is called the Purusha. There is nothing that is not covered by Him, nothing\nthat is not pervaded by Him.\nII-v-19: This is that meditation on things mutually helpful which Dadhyac, versed in the Atharva-Veda,\ntaught the Asvins. Perceiving this the Rishi said, \u2018(He) transformed Himself in accordance with each\nform; that form of His was for the sake of making Him known. The Lord on account of Maya (notions\nsuperimposed by ignorance) is perceived as manifold, for to Him are yoked ten organs, nay, hundreds\nof them. He is the organs; He is ten and thousands \u2013 many and infinite. That Brahman is without prior\nor posterior, without interior or exterior. This self, the perceiver of everything, is Brahman. This is the\nteaching.\nII-vi-1: Now the line of teachers: Pautimasya (received it) from Gaupavana. Gaupavana from another\nPautimasya. This Pautimasya from another Gaupavana.

Janaka, Emperor of Videha, performed a sacrifice in which gifts were freely distributed.\nVedic scholars from Kuru and Panchala were assembled there. Emperor Janaka of Videha had a desire\nto know, \u2018Which is the most erudite of these Vedic scholars ?\u2019 He had a thousand cows confined in a\npen, and on the horns of each cow were fixed ten Padas (of gold).\nIII-i-2: He said to them, \u2018Revered Brahmanas, let him who is the best Vedic scholar among you drive\nthese cows (home).\u2019 None of the Brahmanas dared. Then Yajnavalkya said to a pupil of his, \u2018Dear\nSamasravas, please drive these cows (home).\u2019 He drove them. The Brahmanas were enraged. \u2018How\ndoes he dare to call himself the best Vedic scholar among us ?\u2019 there was a Hotr of Emperor Janaka of\nVideha named Asvala. He now asked Yajnavalkya, \u2018Yajnavalkya, are you indeed the best Vedic scholar\namong us ?\u2019 Yajnavalkya replied, \u2018I bow to the best Vedic scholar, I just want the cows\u2019. Thereupon the\nHotr Asvala determined to interrogate him.\nIII-i-3: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018since all this is overtaken by death, and swayed by it, by what means\ndoes the sacrificer go beyond the clutches of death ?\u2019 \u2018Through the organ of speech \u2013 through fire,\nwhich is the (real) priest called Hotr. The sacrificer\u2019s organ of speech is the Hotr. This organ of speech\nis fire; this fire is the Hotr; this (fire) is liberation; this (liberation) is emancipation\u2019.\nIII-i-4: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018since all this is overtaken by day and night, and swayed by them, by\nwhat means does the sacrificer go beyond the clutches of day and night ?\u2019 \u2018Through the eye \u2013 through\nthe sun, which is the (real) priest called Adhvaryu. The eye of the sacrificer is the Adhvaryu. This eye is\nthe sun; this sun is the Adhvaryu; this (sun) is liberation; this (liberation) is emancipation\u2019.\nIII-i-5: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018since all this is overtaken by the bright and dark fortnights, and swayed\nby them, by what means does the sacrificer go beyond the bright and dark fortnights /\u2019 \u2018Through the\nvital force \u2013 through air, which is the (real) priest called Udgatir. The vital force of the sacrificer is the\nUdgatir. This vital force is air, and it is the Udgatir; this (air) is liberation; this (liberation) is\nemancipation.\u2019\nIII-i-6: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018since the sky is, as it were, without a support, through what support\ndoes the sacrificer go to heaven ?\u2019 \u2018Through the mind \u2013 through the moon, which is the (real) priest\ncalled Brahman. The mind of the sacrificer is the Brahman. This mind is the moon; the moon is the\nBrahman; this (moon) is liberation; this (liberation) is emancipation\u2019. So far about the ways of\nemancipation; now about the meditations based on resemblance.\nIII-i-7: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018with how many kinds of Rik will the Hotr do his part in this sacrifice\nto-day ?\u2019 \u2018With three kinds\u2019. \u2018Which are those three ?\u2019 \u2018The preliminary, the sacrificial, and the\neulogistic hymns as the third\u2019. \u2018What does he win through them ?\u2019 \u2018All this that is living\u2019.\nIII-i-8: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018how many kinds of oblations will the Adhvaryu offer in this sacrifice\nto-day ?\u2019 \u2018Three\u2019. \u2018Which are those three ?\u2019 \u2018Those that blaze up on being offered, those that make a\ngreat noise, when offered, and those that sink on being offered\u2019. \u2018What does he win through them?\u2019\n\u2018Through those that blaze up on being offered he wins the world of the gods, for this world shines, as it\nwere. Through those that make a great noise, when offered, he wins the world of the manes, for this\nworld is full of uproar. And through those that sink on being offered, he wins the human world, for this\nworld is lower.\u2019\n\nIII-i-9: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018through how many gods does this Brahman from the right protect the\nsacrifice to-day ?\u2019 \u2018Through one\u2019. \u2018Which is that one ?\u2019 \u2018The mind. The mind is indeed infinite, and\ninfinite are the Visvadevas. Through this meditation he wins an infinite world\u2019.\nIII-i-10: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018how many classes of hymns the Udgatir chant in this sacrifice today ?\u2019 \u2018Three classes\u2019. \u2018Which are those three ?\u2019 \u2018The preliminary, the sacrificial, and the eulogistic\nhymns as the third\u2019. \u2018Which are those that have reference to the body ?\u2019 \u2018The Prana is the preliminary\nhymn, the Apana is the sacrificial hymn, and the Vyana is the eulogistic hymn\u2019. \u2018What does he win\nthrough them ?\u2019 \u2018Through the preliminary hymns he wins the earth, through the sacrificial hymns he\nwins the sky, and through the eulogistic hymns he wins heaven\u2019. Thereupon the Hotr Asvala kept silent.\nIII-ii-1: Then Artabhaga, of the line of Jaratkaru, asked him. \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018how many are the\nGrahas, and how many are the Atigrahas ?\u2019 \u2018There are eight Grahas and eight Atigrahas\u2019. \u2018Which are\nthose eight Grahas and eight Atigrahas ?\u2019\nIII-ii-2: The Prana (nose) indeed is the Graha; it is controlled by the Atigraha, the Apana (odour), for\none smells odours through the Apana (the air breathed in).\nIII-ii-3: The organ of speech indeed is the graha; it is controlled by the Atigraha, name, for one utters\nnames through the organ of speech.\nIII-ii-4: The tongue indeed is the Graha; it is controlled by the Atigraha, taste, for one knows tastes\nthrough the tongue.\nIII-ii-5: The eye indeed is the Graha; it is controlled by the Atigraha, colour, for one sees colours\nthrough the eye.\nIII-ii-6: The ear indeed is the Graha; it is controlled by the Atigraha, sound, for one hears sounds\nthrough the ear.\nIII-ii-7: The mind indeed is the Graha; it is controlled by the Atigraha, desire, for one wishes desires\nthrough the mind.\nIII-ii-8: The hands indeed is the Graha; it is controlled by the Atigraha, work, for one does work\nthrough the hands.\nIII-ii-9: The skin indeed is the Graha; it is controlled by the Atigraha, touch, for one feels touch through\nthe skin. These are the eight Grahas and eight Atigrahas.\nIII-ii-10: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018since all this is the food of death, who is that god whose food is death\n?\u2019 \u2018Fire is death; it is the food of water. (One who knows thus) conquers further death\u2019.\nIII-ii-11: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018when the (liberated) man dies, do his organs go up from him, or do\nthey not ?\u2019 \u2018No\u2019, replied Yajnavalkya, \u2018(They) merge in him only. The body swells, is inflated, and in\nthat state lies dead.\u2019\nIII-ii-12: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018when this man dies, what is it that does not leave him ?\u2019 \u2018Name. The\nname indeed is infinite, and infinite are the Visvadevas. He (who knows thus) wins thereby a really\ninfinite world\u2019.\nIII-ii-13: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018when the vocal organ of a man who dies is merged in fire, the nose in\nair, the eye in the sun, the mind in the moon, the ear in the quarters, the body in the earth, the ether of\nthe heart in the external ether, the hair on the body in herbs, that on the head in trees, and the blood and\nthe seed are deposited in water, where is then the man ?\u2019 \u2018Give me your hand, dear Artabhaga, we will\ndecide this between ourselves, we cannot do it in a crowded place.\u2019 They went out and talked it over.\nWhat they mentioned there was only work, and what they praised there was also work alone.\n(Therefore) one indeed becomes good through good work and evil through evil work. Thereupon\nArtabhaga, of the line of Jaratkaru, kept silent.\nIII-iii-1: Then Bhujyu, the grandson of Lahya, asked him. \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018we travelled in\nMadra as students, and we came to the house of Patanchala of the line of Kapi. His daughter was\npossessed by a Gandharva. We asked him, \"Who are you ?\" He said, \"I am Sudhanvan, of the line of\n\nAngiras\". When we asked him about the limits of the world, we said to him, \"Where were the\ndescendants of Pariksit ?\" And I ask you, Yajnavalkya, where were the descendants of Pariksit ? (Tell\nme) where were the descendants of Pariksit ?\u2019\nIII-iii-2: Yajnavalkya said, \u2018The Gandharva evidently told you that they went where the performers of\nthe horse sacrifice go\u2019. \u2018And where do the performers of the horse sacrifice go ?\u2019 \u2018Thirty-two times the\nspace covered by the sun\u2019s chariot in a day makes this world; around it, covering twice the area, is the\nearth; around the earth, covering twice the area, is the ocean. Now, as is the edge of a razor, or the wing\nof a fly, so is there just that much opening at the junction (of the two halves of the cosmic shell).\n(Through that they go out.) Fire, in the form of a falcon, delivered them to the air; the air, putting them\nin itself, took them where the (previous) performers of the horse sacrifice were\u2019. Thus did the\nGandharva praise the air. Therefore the air is the diversity of individuals, and the air is the aggregate.\nHe who knows it as such conquers further death. Thereupon Bhujyu, the grandson of Lahya, kept\nsilent.\nIII-iv-1: Then Usata, the son of Chakra, asked him. \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018explain to me the Brahman\nthat is immediate and direct \u2013 the self that is within all.\u2019 \u2018This is your self that is within all\u2019. \u2018Which is\nwithin all, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018That which breathes through the Prana is your self that is within all. That\nwhich moves downwards through the Apana is your self that is within all. That which pervades through\nthe Vyana is your self that is within all. That which goes out through the Udana is your self that is\nwithin all. This is your self that is within all.\u2019\nIII-iv-2: Usata, the son of Chakra, said, \u2018You have indicated it as one may say that a cow is such and\nsuch, or a horse is such and such. Explain to me the Brahman that is immediate and direct \u2013 the self\nthat is within all\u2019. \u2018This is your self that is within all\u2019. \u2018Which is within all, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018You cannot\nsee that which is the witness of vision; you cannot hear that which is the hearer of hearing; you cannot\nthink that which is the thinker of thought; you cannot know that which is the knower of knowledge.\nThis is your self that is within all; everything else but this is perishable.\u2019 Thereupon Usata, the son of\nChakra, kept silent.\niii-v-1: Then Kahola, the son of Kusitaka, asked him, \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said he, \u2018explain to me the\nBrahman that is immediate and direct \u2013 the self that is within all\u2019. \u2018This is your self that is within all\u2019.\n\u2018Which is within all, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018That which transcends hunger and thirst, grief, delusion, decay\nand death. Knowing this very Self the Brahmanas renounce the desire for sons, for wealth and for the\nworlds, and lead a mendicant\u2019s life. That which is the desire for sons is the desire for wealth, and that\nwhich is the desire for wealth is the desire for worlds, for both these are but desires. Therefore the\nknower of Brahman, having known all about scholarship, should try to live upon that strength which\ncomes of knowledge; having known all about this strength and scholarship, he becomes meditative;\nhaving known all about both meditativeness and its opposite, he becomes a knower of Brahman. How\ndoes that knower of b behave ? Howsoever he may behave, he is just such. Except this, everything is\nperishable.\u2019 Thereupon Kahola, the son of Kusitaka, kept silent.\niii-vi-1: Then Gargi, the daughter of Vacaknu, asked him, \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, she said, \u2018if all this is\npervaded by water, by what is water pervaded ?\u2019 \u2018By air, O Gargi\u2019. \u2018By what is air pervaded?\u2019 \u2018By the\nsky, O Gargi\u2019. \u2018By what is the sky pervaded ?\u2019 \u2018By the world of the Gandharvas, O Gargi\u2019. \u2018By what is\nthe world of the Gandharvas pervaded ?\u2019 \u2018By the sun, O Gargi.\u2019 \u2018By what is the sun pervaded ?\u2019 \u2018By the\nmoon, O Gargi.\u2019 \u2018By what is the moon pervaded ?\u2019 \u2018By the stars, O Gargi\u2019. \u2018By what are the stars\npervaded ?\u2019 \u2018By the world of the gods, O Gargi\u2019. \u2018By what is the world of the gods pervaded ?\u2019 \u2018By the\nworld of Indra, O Gargi\u2019. By what is the world of Indra pervaded?\u2019 \u2018By the world of Viraj, O Gargi\u2019.\n\u2018By what is the world of Viraj pervaded?\u2019 \u2018 By the world of Hiranyagarbha, O Gargi\u2019. \u2018By what is the\nworld of Hiranyagarbha pervaded ?\u2019 He said, \u2018Do not, O Gargi, push your inquiry too far, lest your\nhead should fall off. You are questioning about a deity that should not be reasoned about. Do not, O\n\nGargi, push your inquiry too far.\u2019 Thereupon Gargi, the daughter of Vacaknu, kept silent.\nIII-vii-1: Then Uddalaka, the son of Aruna, asked him. \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said, \u2018in Madra we lived in the\nhouse of Patanchala Kapya (descendant of Kapi), studying the scriptures on sacrifices. His wife was\npossessed by a Gandharva. We asked him who he was. He said, \"Kabandha, the son of Atharvan\". He\nsaid to Patanchala Kapya and those who studied the scriptures on sacrifices, \"Hapya, do you know that\nSutra by which this life, the next life and all beings are held together ?\" Patanchala Kapya said, \"I do\nnot know it, sir\". The Gandharva said to him and the students, \"Kapya, do you know that Internal Ruler\nwho controls this and the next life and all beings from within ?\" Patanchala Kapya said, \"I do not know\nHim, sir\". The Gandharva said to him and the students, \"He who knows that Sutra and that Internal\nRuler as above indeed knows Brahman, knows the worlds, knows the gods, knows the Vedas, knows\nbeings, knows the self, and knows everything\". He explained it all to them. I know it. If you,\nYajnavalkya, do not know that Sutra and that Internal Ruler, and still take away the cows that belong\nonly to the knowers of Brahman, your head shall fall off\u2019. \u2018I know, O Gautama, that Sutra and that\nInternal Ruler\u2019. \u2018Any one can say, \"I know, I know\". Tell us what you know.\u2019\nIII-vii-2: He said, \u2018Vayu, O Gautama, is that Sutra. Through this Sutra or Vayu this and the next life and\nall beings are held together. Therefore, O Gautama, when a man dies, they say that his limbs have been\nloosened, for they are held together, O Gautama, by the Sutra or Vayu.\u2019 \u2018Quite so, Yajnavalkya. Now\ndescribe the Internal Ruler.\u2019\nIII-vii-3: He who inhabits the earth, but is within it, whom the earth does not know, whose body is the\nearth, and who controls the earth from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-4: He who inhabits water, but is within it, whom water does not know, whose body is water, and\nwho controls water from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-5: He who inhabits fire, but is within it, whom fire does not know, whose body is fire, and who\ncontrols fire from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-6: He who inhabits the sky, but is within it, whom the sky does not know, whose body is the sky,\nand who controls the sky from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-7: He who inhabits air, but is within it, whom air does not know, whose body is air, and who\ncontrols air from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-8: He who inhabits heaven, but is within it, whom heaven does not know, whose body is heaven,\nand who controls heaven from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-9: He who inhabits the sun, but is within it, whom the sun does not know, whose body is the sun,\nand who controls the sun from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-10: He who inhabits the quarters, but is within it, whom the quarters does not know, whose body\nis the quarters, and who controls the quarters from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-11: He who inhabits the moon and stars, but is within it, whom the moon and stars does not\nknow, whose body is the moon and stars, and who controls the moon and stars from within, is the\nInternal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-12: He who inhabits the ether, but is within it, whom the ether does not know, whose body is the\nether, and who controls the ether from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-13: He who inhabits darkness, but is within it, whom darkness does not know, whose body is\ndarkness, and who controls darkness from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-14: He who inhabits light, but is within it, whom light does not know, whose body is light, and\nwho controls light from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self. This much with reference\nto the gods. Now with reference to the beings.\nIII-vii-15: He who inhabits all beings, but is within it, whom no being knows, whose body is all beings,\nand who controls all beings from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self. This much with\nreference to the beings. Now with reference to the body.\nIII-vii-16: He who inhabits the nose, but is within it, whom the nose does not know, whose body is the\n\nnose, and who controls the nose from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-17: He who inhabits the organ of speech, but is within it, whom the organ of speech does not\nknow, whose body is the organ of speech, and who controls the organ of speech from within, is the\nInternal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-18: He who inhabits the eye, but is within it, whom the eye does not know, whose body is the\neye, and who controls the eye from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-19: He who inhabits the ear, but is within it, whom the ear does not know, whose body is the ear,\nand who controls the ear from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-20: He who inhabits the mind (Manas), but is within it, whom the mind does not know, whose\nbody is the mind, and who controls the mind from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-21: He who inhabits the skin, but is within it, whom the skin does not know, whose body is the\nskin, and who controls the skin from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-22: He who inhabits the intellect, but is within it, whom the intellect does not know, whose body\nis the intellect, and who controls the intellect from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.\nIII-vii-23: He who inhabits the organ of generation, but is within it, whom the organ of generation does\nnot know, whose body is the organ of generation, and who controls the organ of generation from\nwithin, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self. He is never seen, but is the Witness; He is never\nheard, but is the Hearer; He is never thought, but is the Thinker; He is never known, but is the Knower.\nThere is no other witness but Him, no other hearer but Him, no other thinker but Him, no other knower\nbut Him. He is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self. Everything else but Him is mortal.\u2019\nThereupon Uddalaka, the son of Aruna, kept silent.\nIII-viii-1: Then the daughter of Vachaknu said, \u2018Revered Brahmans, I shall him two questions, Should\nhe answer me those, none of you can ever beat him in describing Brahman.\u2019 \u2018Ask, O Gargi\u2019.\nIII-viii-2: She said, \u2018I (shall ask) you (two questions). As a man of Banaras or the King of Videha, scion\nof a warlike dynasty, might string his unstrung bow and appear close by, carrying in his hand two\nbamboo-tipped arrows highly painful to the enemy, even so, O Yajnavalkya, do I confront you with two\nquestions. Answer me those\u2019. \u2018Ask, O Gargi\u2019.\nIII-viii-3: She said, \u2018By what, O Yajnavalkya, is that pervaded which is above heaven and below the\nearth, which is this heaven and earth as well as between them, and which they say was, is and will be ?\u2019\nIII-viii-4: He said, \u2018That, O Gargi, which is above heaven and below the earth, which is this heaven and\nearth as well as between them, and which they say was, is and will be, is pervaded by the Unmanifested\nether.\u2019\nIII-viii-5: She said, \u2018I bow to you, Yajnavalkya, who have fully answered this question of mine. Now be\nready for the other question.\u2019 \u2018Ask, O Gargi\".\nIII-viii-6: She said, \u2018By what, O Yajnavalkya, is that pervaded which is above heaven and below the\nearth, which is this heaven and earth as well as between them, and which they say was, is and will be ?\u2019\nIII-viii-7: He said, \u2018That, O Gargi, which is above heaven and below the earth, which is this heaven and\nearth as well as between them, and which they say was, is and will be, is pervaded by the Unmanifested\nether alone.\u2019 \u2018By what is the Unmanifested ether pervaded?\u2019\nIII-viii-8: He said: O Gargi, the knowers of Brahman say, this Immutable (Brahman) is that. It is neither\ngross nor minute, neither short nor long, neither red colour nor oiliness, neither shadow nor darkness,\nneither air nor ether, unattached, neither savour nor odour, without eyes or ears, without the vocal organ\nor mind, non-luminous, without the vital force or mouth, not a measure, and without interior or\nexterior. It does not eat anything, nor is It eaten by anybody.\nIII-viii-9: Under the mighty rule of this Immutable, O Gargi, the sun and moon are held in their\npositions; under the mighty rule of this Immutable, O Gargi, heaven and earth maintain their positions;\nunder the mighty rule of this Immutable, O Gargi, moments, Muhurtas, days and nights, fortnights,\nmonths, seasons and years are held in their respective places; under the mighty rule of this Immutable,\n\nO Gargi, some rivers flow eastward from the White Mountains, others flowing westward continue in\nthat direction, and still others keep to their respective courses; under the mighty rule of this Immutable,\nO Gargi, men praise those that give, the gods depend on the sacrificer, and the manes on independent\nofferings (Darvihoma).\nIII-viii-10: He, O Gargi, who in this world, without knowing this Immutable, offers oblations in the\nfire, performs sacrifices and undergoes austerities even for many thousand years, finds all such acts but\nperishable; he, O Gargi, who departs from this world without knowing this Immutable, is miserable.\nBut he, O Gargi, who departs from this world after knowing this Immutable, is a knower of Brahman.\nIII-viii-11: This Immutable, O Gargi, is never seen but is the Witness; It is never heard, but is the\nHearer; It is never thought, but is the Thinker; It is never known, but is the Knower. There is no other\nwitness but This, no other hearer but This, no other thinker but This, no other knower but This. By this\nImmutable, O Gargi, is the (Unmanifested) ether pervaded.\nIII-viii-12: She said, \u2018Revered Brahmans, you should consider yourselves fortunate if you can get off\nfrom him through salutations. Never shall any of you beat him in describing Brahman\u2019. Then the\ndaughter of Vachaknu kept silent.\nIII-ix-1: Then Vidagdha, the son of Sakala, asked him. \u2018How many gods are there, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019\nYajnavalkya decided it through this (group of Mantras known as) Nivid (saying), \u2018As many as are\nindicated in the Nivid of the Visvadevas \u2013 three hundred and three, and three thousand and three\u2019. \u2018Very\nwell\u2019, said Sakalya, \u2018how many gods exactly are there, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018Thirty-three\u2019. \u2018Very well\u2019, said\nthe other, \u2018how many gods exactly are there, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018six\u2019. \u2018Very well\u2019, said Sakalya, \u2018how many\ngods exactly are there, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018Three\u2019. \u2018Very well\u2019, said the other, \u2018how many gods exactly are\nthere, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018Two\u2019. \u2018Very well\u2019, said Sakalya, \u2018how many gods exactly are there,\nYajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018One and a half\u2019. \u2018Very well\u2019, said Sakalya, \u2018how many gods exactly are there,\nYajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018One\u2019. \u2018Very well\u2019, said Sakalya, \u2018which are those three hundred and three and three\nthousand and three ?\u2019\nIII-ix-2: Yajnavalkya said, \u2018these are but the manifestation of them, but there are only thirty-three\ngods.\u2019 \u2018Which are those thirty-three ?\u2019 \u2018The eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras and the twelve Adityas \u2013\nthese are thirty-one and Indra and Prajapati make up the thirty-three\u2019.\nIII-ix-3: \u2018Which are the Vasus /\u2019 \u2018Fire, the earth, air, the sky, the sun, heaven, the moon and the stars \u2013\nthese are the Vasus, for in these all this is placed; therefore they are called Vasus.\u2019\nIII-ix-4: \u2018Which are the Rudras ?\u2019 \u2018The ten organs in the human body, with the mind as the eleventh.\nWhen they depart from this mortal body, they make (one\u2019s relatives) weep. Because they then make\nthem weep, therefore they are called Rudras.\u2019\nIII-ix-5: \u2018Which are the Adityas ?\u2019 \u2018The twelve months (are parts) of a year; these are the Adityas, for\nthey go taking all this with them. Because they go taking all this with them, therefore they are called\nAdityas.\u2019\nIII-ix-6: \u2018Which is Indra, and which is Prajapati ?\u2019 \u2018The cloud itself is Indra, and the sacrifice is\nPrajapati\u2019. \u2018Which is the cloud ?\u2019 \u2018Thunder (strength).\u2019 \u2018Which is the sacrifice ?\u2019 \u2018Animals\u2019.\nIII-ix-7: \u2018Which are the six (gods) ?\u2019 \u2018Fire, the earth, air, the sky, the sun, and heaven \u2013 these are the\nsix. Because all those (gods) are (comprised in) these six.\u2019\nIII-ix-8: \u2018Which are the three gods ?\u2019 \u2018These three worlds alone, because in these all those gods are\ncomprised.\u2019 \u2018Which are the two gods ?\u2019 \u2018Matter and the vital force.\u2019 \u2018Which are the one and a half ?\u2019\n\u2018This (air) that blows.\u2019\nIII-ix-9: \u2018Regarding this some say, \u2018Since the air blows as one substance, how can it be one and a\nhalf ?\u2019 \u2018 It is one and a half because through its presence all this attains surpassing glory\u2019. \u2018Which is the\none god ?\u2019 \u2018The vital force (Hiranyagarbha); it is Brahman, which is called Tyat (that).\u2019\nIII-ix-10: \u2018He who knows that being whose abode is the earth, whose instrument of vision is fire,\nwhose light is the Manas, and who is the ultimate resort of the entire body and organs, knows truly, O\n\nYajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018I do know that being of whom you speak \u2013 who is the ultimate resort of the entire body\nand organs. It is the very being who is identified with the body. Go on, Sakalya.\u2019 \u2018Who is his deity\n(cause) ?\u2019 \u2018Nectar (chyle)\u2019, said he.\nIII-ix-11: \u2018He who knows that being whose abode is lust, whose instrument of vision is the intellect,\nwhose light is the Manas, and who is the ultimate resort of the entire body and organs, knows truly, O\nYajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018I do know that being of whom you speak \u2013 who is the ultimate resort of the entire body\nand organs. It is the very being who is identified with lust. Go on, Sakalya\u2019. \u2018Who is his deity ?\u2019\n\u2018Women\u2019, said he.\nIII-ix-12: \u2018He who knows that being whose abode is colours, whose instrument of vision is the eye,\nwhose light is the Manas, and who is the ultimate resort of the entire body and organs, knows truly, O\nYajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018I do know that being of whom you speak \u2013 who is the ultimate resort of the entire body\nand organs. It is the very being who is in the sun. Go on Sakalya\u2019. \u2018Who is his deity ?\u2019 'Truth (the eye),\u2019\nsaid he.\nIII-ix-13: \u2018He who knows that being whose abode is the ether, whose instrument of vision is the ear,\nwhose light is the Manas, and who is the ultimate resort of the entire body and organs, knows truly, O\nYajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018I do know that being of whom you speak \u2013 who is the ultimate resort of the entire body\nand organs. It is the very being who is identified with the ear and with the time of hearing. Go on,\nSakalya\u2019. \u2018Who is his deity ?\u2019 \u2018The quarters\u2019, said he.\nIII-ix-14: \u2018He who knows that being whose abode is darkness, whose instrument of vision is the\nintellect, whose light is the Manas, and who is the ultimate resort of the entire body and organs, knows\ntruly, O Yajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018I do know that being of whom you speak \u2013 who is the ultimate resort of the\nentire body and organs. It is the very being who is identified with shadow (ignorance). Go on, Sakalya\u2019.\n\u2018Who is his deity?\u2019 \u2018Death\u2019, said he.\nIII-ix-15: \u2018He who knows that being whose abode is (particular) colours, whose instrument of vision is\nthe eye, whose light is the Manas, and who is the ultimate resort of the entire body and organs, knows\ntruly, O Yajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018I do know that being of whom you speak \u2013 who is the ultimate resort of the\nentire body and organs. It is the very being who is in a looking-glass. Go on, Sakalya\u2019. \u2018Who is his\ndeity ?\u2019 \u2018The vital force\u2019, said he.\nIII-ix-16: \u2018He who knows that being whose abode is water, whose instrument of vision is the intellect,\nwhose light is the Manas, and who is the ultimate resort of the entire body and organs, knows truly, O\nYajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018I do know that being of whom you speak \u2013 who is the ultimate resort of the entire body\nand organs. It is the very being who is in water. Go on, Sakalya\u2019. \u2018Who is his deity ?\u2019 \u2018Varuna (rain)\u2019,\nsaid he.\nIII-ix-17: \u2018He who knows that being whose abode is the seed, whose instrument of vision is the\nintellect, whose light is the Manas, and who is the ultimate resort of the entire body and organs, knows\ntruly, O Yajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018I do know that being of whom you speak \u2013 who is the ultimate resort of the\nentire body and organs. It is the very being who is identified with the son. Go on, Sakalya\u2019. \u2018Who is his\ndeity ?\u2019 \u2018Prajapati (the father)\u2019, said he.\nIII-ix-18: \u2018Sakalya\u2019, said Yajnavalkya, \u2018have these Vedic scholars made you their instrument for\nburning charcoals ?\u2019\nIII-ix-19: \u2018Yajnavalkya\u2019, said Sakalya, \u2018is it because you know Brahman that you have thus flouted\nthese Vedic scholars of Kuru and Panchala ?\u2019 \u2018I know the quarters with their deities and supports\u2019. \u2018If\nyou know the quarters with their deities and supports -III-ix-20: \u2018What deity are you identified with in the east ?\u2019 \u2018With the deity, sun\u2019. \u2018On what does the sun\nrest ?\u2019 \u2018On the eye\u2019. \u2018On what does the eye rest ?\u2019 \u2018On colours, for one sees colours with the eye\u2019. \u2018On\nwhat do colours rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the heart (mind)\u2019, said Yajnavalkya, \u2018for one knows colours through the\nheart; it is on the heart that colours rest\u2019. \u2018It is just so, Yajnavalkya\u2019.\nIII-ix-21: \u2018What deity are you identified with in the south ?\u2019 \u2018With the deity, Yama (the god of justice)\u2019.\nOn what does Yama rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the sacrifice\u2019. \u2018On what does the sacrifice rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the remuneration\n\n(of the priests).\u2019 \u2018On what does the remuneration rest ?\u2019 \u2018On faith, because whenever a man has faith,\nhe gives remuneration to the priests; therefore it is on faith that the remuneration rests\u2019. \u2018On what does\nfaith rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the heart\u2019, said Yajnavalkya, \u2018for one knows faith through the heart; therefore it is on\nthe heart that faith rests\u2019. \u2018It is just so, Yajnavalkya\u2019.\nIII-ix-22: \u2018What deity are you identified with in the west ?\u2019 \u2018With the deity, Varuna (the god of rain)\u2019.\n\u2018On what does Varuna rest ?\u2019 \u2018On water\u2019. \u2018On what does water rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the seed\u2019. \u2018On what does the\nseed rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the heart. Therefore do they say of a new-born child closely resembles (his father), that\nhe has sprung from (his father\u2019s) heart, as it were \u2013 that he has been made out of (his father\u2019s) heart, as\nit were. Therefore it is on the heart that the seed rests\u2019. \u2018It is just so, Yajnavalkya\u2019.\nIII-ix-23: \u2018What deity are you identified with in the north ?\u2019 \u2018With the deity, Soma (the moon and the\ncreeper)\u2019 \u2018On what does Soma rest ?\u2019 \u2018On initiation\u2019. \u2018On what does initiation rest ?\u2019 \u2018On truth.\nTherefore do they say to one initiated, \"Speak the truth\"; for it is on truth that initiation rests\u2019. \u2018On what\ndoes truth rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the heart\u2019, said Yajnavalkya, \u2018for one knows truth through the heart; therefore it is\non the heart that truth rests\u2019. \u2018It is just so, Yajnavalkya\u2019.\nIII-ix-24: \u2018What deity are you identified with in the fixed direction (above) ?\u2019 \u2018With the deity, fire\u2019. \u2018On\nwhat does fire rest ?\u2019 \u2018On speech\u2019. \u2018On what does speech rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the heart\u2019. \u2018On what does the heart\nrest ?\u2019\nIII-ix-25: \u2018You ghost\u2019, said Yajnavalkya, \u2018when you think the heart is elsewhere than in us, (then the\nbody is dead). Should it be elsewhere than in us, dogs would eat this body, or birds tear it to pieces\u2019.\nIII-ix-26: On what do the body and the heart rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the Prana\u2019. \u2018On what does the Prana rest ?\u2019 \u2018On\nthe Apana.\u2019 \u2018On what does the Apana rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the Vyana.\u2019 \u2018On what does the Vyana rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the\nUdana\u2019. \u2018On what does the Udana rest ?\u2019 \u2018On the Samana\u2019. This self is That which has been described\nas \u2018Not this, not this\u2019. It is imperceptible, for it is never perceived; undecaying, for It never decays;\nunattached, for It is never attached; unfettered \u2013 It never feels pain, and never suffers injury. \u2018These are\nthe eight abodes, the eight instruments of vision, the eight deities and the eight beings. I ask you of that\nBeing who is to be known only from the Upanishads, who definitely projects those beings and\nwithdraws them into Himself, and who is at the same time transcendent. If you cannot clearly tell me of\nHim, your head shall fall off\u2019. Sakalya did not know Him; his head fell off; and robbers snatched away\nhis bones, mistaking them for something else.\nIII-ix-27: Then he said, \u2018Revered Brahmanas, whichsoever amongst you wishes may interrogate me or\nall of you may. Or I shall question whichsoever amongst you wishes, or all of you\u2019. The Brahmanas did\nnot dare.\nIII-ix-28(1): He asked them through these verses: As a large tree, so indeed is a man. (This is) true. His\nhair is its leaves, his skin its outer bark.\nIII-ix-28(2): It is from his skin that blood flows, and from the bark sap. Therefore when a man is\nwounded, blood flows, as sap from a tree is injured.\nIII-ix-28(3): His flesh is its inner bark, and his tendons its innermost layer of bark; both are tough. His\nbones lie under, as does its wood; his marrow is comparable to its pith.\nIII-ix-28(4): If a tree, after it is felled, springs again from its root in a newer form, from what root\nindeed does man spring forth after he is cut off by death ?\nIII-ix-28(5): Do not say, \u2018From the seed\u2019. (for) it is produced in a living man. A tree springs also from\nthe seed; after it is dead it certainly springs again (from the seed as well).\nIII-ix-28(6): If someone pulls out a tree with its root, it no more sprouts. From what root does a man\nspring forth after he is cut off by death ?\nIII-ix-28(7): If you think he is ever born, I say, no, he is again born. Now who should again bring him\nforth ? -- Knowledge, Bliss, Brahman, the supreme goal of the dispenser of wealth as well as of him\nwho has realized Brahman and lives in It.\nIV-i-1: Om. Janaka, Emperor of Videha, took his seat, when there came Yajnavalkya. Janaka said to\n\nhim, \u2018Yajnavalkya, what has brought you here ? To have some animals, or to hear some subtle\nquestions asked ?\u2019 \u2018Both, O Emperor\u2019, said Yajnavalkya.\nIV-i-2: \u2018Let me hear what any one of your teachers may have told you\u2019. \u2018Jitvan, the son of Silina, has\ntold me that the organ of speech (fire) is Brahman\u2019. \u2018As one who has a mother, a father and a teacher\nshould say, so has the son of Silina said this \u2013 that the organ of speech is Brahman, for what can a\nperson have who cannot speak? But did he tell you about its abode (body) and support?\u2019 \u2018No, he did\nnot\u2019. \u2018This Brahman is only one-footed, O Emperor\u2019. \u2018Then you tell us, Yajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018The organ of\nspeech is its abode, and the ether (the Undifferentiated) its support. It should be meditated upon as\nintelligence\u2019. \u2018What is intelligence, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018The organ of speech itself, O Emperor\u2019, said\nYajnavalkya, \u2018through the organ of speech, O Emperor, friend is known; The Rig-Veda, Yajur-Veda,\nSama-Veda, Atharvangirasa, (Vedic) history, mythology, arts, Upanishads, verses, aphorisms,\nelucidations and explanations, (the effects of) sacrifices, (of) offering oblations in the fire and (of)\ngiving food and drink, this world and the next, and all beings are known through the organ of speech\nalone, O Emperor. The organ of speech, O Emperor, is the supreme Brahman. The organ of speech\nnever leaves him who, knowing thus, meditates upon it, all beings eagerly come to him, and being a\ngod, he attains the gods.\u2019 \u2018I give you a thousand cows with a bull like an elephant\u2019, said Emperor\nJanaka. Yajnavalkya replied, \u2018My father was of opinion that one should not accept (wealth) from a\ndisciple without fully instructing him\u2019.\nIV-i-3: \u2018Let me hear whatever any one may have told you\u2019. \u2018Udanka, the son of Sulba, has told me that\nthe vital force (Vayu) is Brahman\u2019. \u2018As one who has a mother, a father and a teacher should say, so has\nthe son of Sulba said this \u2013 that the vital force is Brahman, for what can a person have who does not\nlive ? But did he tell you about its abode (body) and support ?\u2019 \u2018No, he did not\u2019. \u2018This Brahman is only\none-footed, O Emperor\u2019. \u2018Then you tell us, Yajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018The vital force is its abode, and the ether\n(the Undifferentiated) its support. It should be meditated upon as dear\u2019. \u2018What is dearness,\nYajnavalkya ?\u2019 The vital force itself, O Emperor\u2019, said Yajnavalkya; \u2018for the sake of the vital force, O\nEmperor, a man performs sacrifices for one for whom they should not be performed, and accepts gifts\none from whom they should not be accepted, and it is for the sake of the vital force, O Emperor, that\none runs the risk of one\u2019s life in any quarter one may go to. The vital force, O Emperor, is the Supreme\nBrahman. The vital force never leaves him who, knowing thus, meditates upon it, all beings eagerly\ncome to him, and being a god, he attains the gods\u2019. \u2018I give you a thousand cows with a bull like an\nelephant\u2019, said Emperor Janaka. Yajnavalkya replied, \u2018My father was of opinion that one should not\naccept (wealth) from a disciple without fully instructing him\u2019.\nIV-i-4: \u2018Let me hear whatever any one may have told you\u2019. \u2018Barku, the son of Vrsna, has told me that\nthe eye (sun) is Brahman\u2019. \u2018As one who has a mother, a father and a teacher should say, so has the son\nof Vrsna said this \u2013 that the eye is Brahman. For what can a person have who cannot see ? But did he\ntell you about its abode (body) and support ?\u2019 \u2018No, he did not\u2019. \u2018This Brahman is only one-footed, O\nEmperor\u2019. \u2018Then you tell us, Yajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018The eye is its abode, and the ether (the Undifferentiated) its\nsupport. It should be meditated upon as truth\u2019. \u2018What is truth, Yajnavalkya?\u2019 \u2018\u2019The eye itself, O\nEmperor\u2019, said Yajnavalkya; if a person, O Emperor, says to one who has seen with his eyes, \"Have\nyou seen ?\" and the latter answers, \"Yes, I have\", then it is true. The eye, O Emperor, is the Supreme\nBrahman. The eye never leaves him who, knowing thus, meditates upon it; all beings eagerly come to\nhim; and being a god, he attains the gods\u2019. \u2018I give you a thousand cows with a bull like an elephant\u2019,\nsaid Emperor Janaka. Yajnavalkya replied, \u2018My father was of opinion that one should not accept\n(wealth) from a disciple without fully instructing him\u2019.\nIV-i-5: \u2018Let me hear whatever any one may have told you\u2019. \u2018Gardabhivipita, of the line of Bharadvaja,\nhas told me that the ear (the quarters) is Brahman\u2019. \u2018As one who has a mother, a father and a teacher\nshould say, so has the descendant of Bharadvaja said this \u2013 that the ear is Brahman. For what can a\nperson have who cannot hear ? But did he tell you about its abode (body) and support ?\u2019 \u2018No, he did\n\nnot\u2019. \u2018This Brahman is only one-footed, O Emperor\u2019. \u2018Then you tell us, Yajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018The ear is its\nabode, and the ether (the Undifferentiated) its support. It should be meditated upon as infinite\u2019. \u2018What\nis infinity, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018The quarters themselves, O Emperor\u2019, said Yajnavalkya; \u2018therefore, O\nEmperor, to whatever direction one may go, one never reaches its end. (Hence) the quarters are infinite.\nThe quarters, O Emperor, are the ear, and the ear, O Emperor, is the Supreme Brahman. The ear never\nleaves him who, knowing thus, meditates upon it; all beings eagerly come to him; and being a god, he\nattains the gods\u2019. \u2018I give you a thousand cows with a bull like an elephant\u2019, said Emperor Janaka.\nYajnavalkya replied, \u2018My father was of opinion that one should not accept (wealth) from a disciple\nwithout fully instructing him\u2019.\nIV-i-6: \u2018Let me hear whatever any one may have told you\u2019. \u2018Satyakama, the son of Jabala, has told me\nthat the Manas (here, the moon) is Brahman\u2019. \u2018As one who has a mother, a father and a teacher should\nsay, so has the son of Jabala said this \u2013 that the Manas is Brahman. For what can a person have without\nthe Manas ? But did he tell you about its abode (body) and support ?\u2019 \u2018No, he did not\u2019. \u2018This Brahman\nis only one-footed, O Emperor\u2019. \u2018Then you tell us, Yajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018The Manas is its abode, and the ether\n(the Undifferentiated) its support. It should be meditated upon as bliss\u2019. \u2018What is bliss, Yajnavalkya ?\u2019\n\u2018The manas itself, O Emperor\u2019, said Yajnavalkya; \u2018with the Manas, O Emperor, a man (fancies and)\nwoos a woman. A son resembling him is born of her, and he is the cause of bliss. The Manas, O\nEmperor, is the Supreme Brahman. The Manas never leaves him who, knowing thus, meditates upon it;\nall beings eagerly come to him; and being a god, he attains the gods\u2019. \u2018I give you a thousand cows with\na bull like an elephant\u2019, said Emperor Janaka. Yajnavalkya replied, \u2018My father was of opinion that one\nshould not accept (wealth) from a disciple without fully instructing him\u2019.\nIV-i-7: \u2018Let me hear whatever any one may have told you\u2019. \u2018Vidagdha, the son of Sakala, has told me\nthat the heart (mind, here, Prajapati ) is Brahman\u2019. \u2018As one who has a mother, a father and a teacher\nshould say, so has the son of Sakala said this \u2013 that the heart is Brahman. For what can a person have\nwithout the heart ? But did he tell you about its abode (body) and support ?\u2019 \u2018No, he did not\u2019. \u2018This\nBrahman is only one-footed, O Emperor\u2019. \u2018Then you tell us, Yajnavalkya\u2019. \u2018The heart is its abode, and\nthe ether (the Undifferentiated) its support. It should be meditated upon as stability\u2019. \u2018What is stability,\nYajnavalkya ?\u2019 \u2018The heart itself, O Emperor\u2019, said Yajnavalkya; \u2018the heart, O Emperor, is the abode of\nall beings, and the heart, O Emperor, is the support of all beings; on the heart, O Emperor, all beings\nrest; the heart, O Emperor, is the Supreme Brahman. The heart never leaves him who, knowing thus,\nmeditates upon it; all beings eagerly come to him; and being a god, he attains the gods\u2019. \u2018I give you a\nthousand cows with a bull like an elephant\u2019, said Emperor Janaka. Yajnavalkya replied, \u2018My father was\nof opinion that one should not accept (wealth) from a disciple without fully instructing him\u2019.\nIV-ii-1: Janaka, Emperor of Videha, rose from his lounge and approaching Yajnavalkya said,\n\u2018Salutations to you, Yajnavalkya, please instruct me\u2019. Yajnavalkya replied, \u2018As one wishing to go a long\ndistance, O Emperor, should secure a chariot or a boat, so have you fully equipped your mind with so\nmany secret names (of Brahman). You are likewise respected and wealthy, and you have studied the\nVedas and heard the Upanishads; (but) where will you go when you are separated from this body ?\u2019 \u2018I\ndo not know, sir, where I shall go\u2019. \u2018Then I will tell you where you will go\u2019. \u2018Tell me, sir\u2019.\nIV-ii-2: This being who is in the right eye is named Indha. Though he is Indha, he is indirectly called\nIndra, for the gods have a fondness, as it were, for indirect names, and hate to be called directly.\nIV-ii-3: The human form that is in the left eye is his wife, Viraj (matter). The space that is within the\nheart is their place of union. Their food is the lump of blood (the finest essence of what we eat) in the\nheart. Their wrap is the net-like structure in the heart. Their road for moving is the nerve that goes\nupward from the heart; it is like a hair split into a thousand parts. In this body there are nerves called\nHita, which are placed in the heart. Through these the essence of our food passes as it moves on.\nTherefore the subtle body has finer food than the gross body.\nIV-ii-4: Of the sage (who is identified with the vital force), the east is the eastern vital force, the south\n\nthe southern vital force, the west the western vital force, the north the northern vital force, the direction\nabove the upper vital force, the direction below the nether vital force, and all the quarters the different\nvital forces. This self is That which has been described as \u2018Not this, Not this\u2019, \u2018It is imperceptible, for It\nis never perceived; undecaying, for It never decays; unattached, for It is never attached; unfettered \u2013 It\nnever feels pain, and never suffers injury. You have attained That which is free from fear, O Janaka\u2019,\nsaid Yajnavalkya. \u2018Revered Yajnavalkya\u2019, said Emperor Janaka, \u2018may That which is free from fear be\nyours, for you have made That which is free from fear known to us. Salutations to you ! Here is this\n(empire of) Videha, as well as myself at your service !\u2019\nIV-iii-1: Yajnavalkya went to Janaka, Emperor of Videha. He thought he would not say anything. Now\nJanaka and Yajnavalkya had once talked on the Agnihotra, and Yajnavalkya had offered him a boon. He\nhad begged the liberty of asking any questions he liked; and Yajnavalkya had granted him the boon. So\nit was the e who first asked him.\nIV-iii-2: \u2018Yajnavalkya, what serves as the light for a man ?\u2019 \u2018The light of the sun, O Emperor\u2019, said\nYajnavalkya; \u2018it is through the light of the sun that he sits, goes out, works and returns\u2019. \u2018It is just so,\nYajnavalkya\u2019.\nIV-iii-3: \u2018When the sun has set, Yajnavalkya, what exactly serves as the light for a man ?\u2019 \u2018The moon\nserves as his light. It is through the light of the moon that he sits, goes out, works and returns\u2019. \u2018It is just\nso, Yajnavalkya\u2019.\nIV-iii-4: \u2018When the sun and the moon have set, Yajnavalkya, what exactly serves as the light for a\nman ?\u2019 \u2018The fire serves as his light. It is through the fire that he sits, goes out, works and returns\u2019. \u2018It is\njust so, Yajnavalkya\u2019.\nIV-iii-5: When the sun and the moon have both set, and the fire has gone out, Yajnavalkya, what exactly\nserves as the light for a man ?\u2019 \u2018Speech (sound) serves as his light. It is through the light of speech that\nhe sits, goes out, works and returns. Therefore, O Emperor, even when one\u2019s own hand is not clearly\nvisible, if a sound is uttered, one manages to go there.\u2019. \u2018It is just so, Yajnavalkya\u2019.\nIV-iii-6: When the sun and the moon have both set, the fire has gone out, and speech has stopped,\nYajnavalkya, what exactly serves as the light for a man ?\u2019 \u2018The self serves as his light. It is through the\nlight of the self that he sits, goes out, works and returns.\u2019 \u2018It is just so, Yajnavalkya\u2019.\nIV-iii-7: \u2018Which is the self ?\u2019 \u2018This infinite entity (Purusha) that is identified with the intellect and is in\nthe midst of the organs, the (self-effulgent) light within the heart (intellect). Assuming the likeness (of\nthe intellect), it moves between the two worlds; it thinks, as it were, and shakes, as it were. Being\nidentified with dream, it transcends this world \u2013 the forms of death (ignorance etc.).\u2019\nIV-iii-8: That man, when he is born, or attains a body, is connected with evils (the body and organs);\nand when he dies, or leaves the body, he discards those evils.\nIV-iii-9: That man only two abodes, this and the next world. The dream state, which is the third, is at\nthe junction (of the two). Staying at that junction, he surveys the two abodes, this and the next world.\nWhatever outfit he may have for the next world, providing himself with that he sees both evils\n(sufferings) and joys. When he dreams, he takes away a little of (the impressions of) this all-embracing\nworld (the waking state), himself puts the body aside and himself creates (a dream body in its place),\nrevealing his own lustre by his own light \u2013 and dreams. In this state the man himself becomes the light.\nIV-iii-10: There are no chariots, nor animals to be yoked to them, nor roads there, but he creates the\nchariots, the animals and the roads. There are no pleasures, joys, or delights there, but he creates the\npleasures, joys and delights. There are no pools, tanks, or rivers there, but he creates the pools, tanks\nand rivers. For he is the agent.\nIV-iii-11: Regarding this there are the following pithy verses: \u2018The radiant infinite being (Purusha) who\nmoves alone, puts the body aside in the dream state, and remaining awake himself and taking the\nshining functions of the organs with him, watches those that are asleep. Again he comes to the waking\nstate.\n\nIV-iii-12: \u2018The radiant infinite being who is immortal and moves alone, preserves the unclean nest (the\nbody) with the help of the vital force, and roams out of the nest. Himself immortal, he goes wherever\nhe likes.\nIV-iii-13: \u2018In the dream world, the shining one, attaining higher and lower states, puts forth\ninnumerable forms. He seems to be enjoying himself in the company of women, or laughing, or even\nseeing frightful things.\nIV-iii-14: \u2018All see his sport, but none sees him\u2019. They say, \u2018Do not wake him up suddenly\u2019. If he does\nnot find the right organ, the body becomes difficult to doctor. Others, however, say that the dream state\nof a man is nothing but the waking state, because he sees in dream only those things that he sees in the\nwaking state. (This is wrong) In the dream state the man himself becomes the light. \u2018I give you a\nthousand (cows), sir. Please instruct me further about liberation\u2019.\nIV-iii-15: After enjoying himself and roaming, and merely seeing (the result of) good and evil (in\ndream), he (stays) in a state of profound sleep, and comes back in the inverse order to his former\ncondition, the dream state. He is untouched by whatever he sees in that state, for this infinite being is\nunattached. \u2018It is just so, Yajnavalkya. I give you a thousand (cows), sir. Please instruct me further\nabout liberation itself.\u2019\nIV-iii-16: After enjoying himself and roaming in the dream state, and merely seeing (the results of)\ngood and evil, he comes back in the inverse order to his former condition, the waking state. He is\nuntouched by whatever he sees in that state, for this infinite being is unattached. \u2018It is just so,\nYajnavalkya. I give you a thousand (cows), sir. Please instruct me further about liberation itself.\u2019\nIV-iii-17: After enjoying himself and roaming in the waking state, and merely seeing (the result of)\ngood and evil, he comes back in the inverse order to his former condition, the dream state (or that of\nprofound sleep).\nIV-iii-18: As a great fish swims alternately to both the banks (of a river), eastern and western, so does\nthis infinite being move to both these states, the dream and waking states.\nIV-iii-19: As a hawk or a falcon flying in the sky becomes tired, and stretching its wings, is bound for\nits nest, so does this infinite being run for this state, where, falling asleep, he craves no desire and sees\nno dream.\nIV-iii-20: In him are those nerves called Hita, which are as fine as a hair split into a thousand parts, and\nfilled with white, blue, brown, green and red (serums). (They are the seat of the subtle body, in which\nimpressions are stored). Now when (he feels) as if he were being killed or overpowered, or being\npursued by an elephant, or falling into a pit, (in short) conjures up at the time through ignorance\nwhatever terrible things he has experienced in the waking state, (that is the dream state). And when (he\nbecomes) a god, as it were, or a king, as it were, thinks, \u2018This (universe) is myself, who am all\u2019, that is\nhis highest state.\nIV-iii-21: That is his form \u2013 beyond desires, free from evils and fearless. As a man, fully embraced by\nhis beloved wife, does not know anything at all, either external or internal, so does this infinite being\n(self), fully embraced by the Supreme Self, not know anything at all, either external or internal. That is\nhis form \u2013 in which all objects of desire have been attained and are but the self, and which is free from\ndesire and devoid of grief.\nIV-iii-22: In this state a father is no father, a mother no mother, worlds no worlds, the gods no gods, the\nVedas no Vedas. In this state a thief is no thief, the killer of a noble Brahmana no killer, a Chandala no\nChandala, a Pulkasa no Pulkasa, a monk no monk, a hermit no hermit. (This form of his) is untouched\nby good work and untouched by evil work, for he is then beyond all the woes of his heart (intellect).\nIV-iii-23: That it does not see in that state is because, though seeing then, it does not see; for the vision\nof the witness can never be lost, because it is imperishable. But there is not that second thing separate\nfrom it which it can see.\nIV-iii-24: That it does not smell in that state is because, though smelling then, it does not smell; for the\nsmeller\u2019s function of smelling can never be lost, because it is imperishable. But there is not that second\n\nthing separate from it which it can smell.\nIV-iii-25: That it does not taste in that state is because, though tasting then, it does not taste; for the\ntaster\u2019s function of tasting can never be lost, because it is imperishable. But there is not that second\nthing separate from it which it can taste.\nIV-iii-26: That it does not speak in that state is because, though speaking then, it does not speak; for the\nspeaker\u2019s function of speaking can never be lost, because it is imperishable. But there is not that second\nthing separate from it which it can speak.\nIV-iii-27: That it does not hear in that state is because, though hearing then, it does not hear; for the\nlistener\u2019s function of hearing can never be lost, because it is imperishable. But there is not that second\nthing separate from it which it can hear.\nIV-iii-28: That it does not think in that state is because, though thinking then, it does not think; for the\nthinker\u2019s function of thinking can never be lost, because it is imperishable. But there is not that second\nthing separate from it which it can think.\nIV-iii-29: That it does not touch in that state is because, though touching then, it does not touch; for the\ntoucher\u2019s function of touching can never be lost, because it is imperishable. But there is not that second\nthing separate from it which it can touch.\nIV-iii-30: That it does not know in that state is because, though knowing then, it does not know; for the\nknower\u2019s function of knowing can never be lost, because it is imperishable. But there is not that second\nthing separate from it which it can know.\nIV-iii-31: When there is something else, as it were, then one can see something, one can smell\nsomething, one can taste something, one can speak something, one can hear something, one can think\nsomething, one can touch something, or one can know something.\nIV-iii-32: It becomes (transparent) like water, one, the witness, and without a second. This is the\nsphere )(state) of Brahman, O Emperor. Thus did Yajnavalkya instruct Janaka: This is its supreme\nattainment, this is its supreme glory, this is its highest world, this is its supreme bliss. On a particle of\nthis very bliss other beings live.\nIV-iii-33: He who is perfect of physique and prosperous among men, the ruler of others, and most\nlavishly supplied with all human enjoyments, represents greatest joy among men. This human joy\nmultiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy for the manes who have won that world of theirs. The\njoy of these manes who have won that world multiplied a hundred times makes one unit joy in the\nworld of the celestial minstrels. This joy in the world of the celestial minstrels multiplied a hundred\ntimes makes one unit of joy for the gods by action \u2013 those who have attained their godhead by their\nactions. This joy of the gods by action multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy for the gods by\nbirth, as also of one who is versed in the Vedas, sinless and free from desire. This joy of the gods by\nbirth multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy in the world of Prajapati (Viraj), as well as one\nwho is versed in the Vedas, sinless and free from desire. This joy in the world of Prajapati multiplied a\nhundred times makes one unit of joy in the world of Brahman (Hiranyagarbha), as well as of one who\nis versed in the Vedas, sinless and free from desire. This indeed is the supreme bliss. This is the state of\nBrahman, O Emperor, said Yajnavalkya. \u2018I give you a thousand (cows), sir. Please instruct me further\nabout liberation itself\u2019. At this Yajnavalkya was afraid that the intelligent Emperor was constraining\nhim to finish with all his conclusions.\nIV-iii-34: After enjoying himself and roaming in the dream state, and merely seeing the effects of\nmerits and demerits, he comes back, in the inverse order, to his former condition, the waking state.\nIV-iii-35: Just as a cart, heavily loaded, goes on rumbling, so does the self that is in the body, being\npresided over by the Supreme Self, go making noises, when breathing becomes difficult.\nIV-iii-36: When this (body) becomes thin \u2013 is emaciated through old age or disease \u2013 then, as a mango,\nor a fig, or a fruit of the Peepul tree is detached from its stalk, so does this infinite being, completely\ndetaching himself from the parts of the body, again go, in the same way that he came, to particular\nbodies, for the unfoldment of his vital force.\n\nIV-iii-37: Just as when a king is coming, the Ugras set against particular offences, the Sutas and the\nleaders of the village wait for him with varieties of food and drink and mansions ready, saying, \u2018Here\nhe comes, here he comes\u2019, so for the person who knows about the results of his work, all the elements\nwait saying, \u2018Here comes Brahman, here he comes\u2019.\nIV-iii-38: Just as when the king wishes to depart, the Ugras set against particular offences, the Sutas\nand the leaders of the village approach him, so do all the organs approach the departing man at the time\nof death, when breathing becomes difficult.\nIV-iv-1: When this self becomes weak and senseless, as it were, the organs come to it. Completely\nwithdrawing these particles of light, it comes to the heart. When the presiding deity of the eye turns\nback from all sides, the man fails to notice colour.\nIV-iv-2: (The eye) becomes united (with the subtle body); then people say, \u2018He does not see\u2019. (The\nnose) becomes united; then they say, \u2018He does not smell\u2019. (The tongue) becomes united; then they say,\n\u2018He does not taste\u2019. (The vocal Organ) becomes united; then they say, \u2018He does not speak\u2019. (The ear)\nbecomes united; then they say, \u2018He does not hear\u2019. (The Manas) becomes united; then they say, \u2018He\ndoes not think\u2019. (The skin) becomes united; then they say, \u2018He does not touch\u2019. (The intellect) becomes\nunited; then they say, \u2018He does not know\u2019. The top of the heart brightens. Through that brightened top\nthe self departs, either through the eye, or through the head, or through any other part of the body.\nWhen it departs, the vital force follows; when the vital force departs, all the organs follow. Then the\nself has particular consciousness, and goes to the body which is related to that consciousness. It is\nfollowed by knowledge, work and past experience.\nIV-iv-3: Just as a leech supported on a straw goes to the end of it, takes hold of another support and\ncontracts itself, so does the self throw this body aside \u2013 make it senseless \u2013 take hold of another\nsupport, and contract itself.\nIV-iv-4: Just as a goldsmith takes apart a little quantity of gold and fashions another \u2013 a newer and\nbetter \u2013 form, so does the self throw this body away, or make it senseless, and make another \u2013 a newer\nand better \u2013 form suited to the manes or the celestial minstrels, or the gods, or Viraj, or Hiranyagarbha,\nor other beings.\nIV-iv-5: That self is indeed Brahman, as also identified with the intellect, the Manas and the vital force,\nwith the eyes and ears, with earth, water, air and the ether, with fire, and what is other than fire, with\ndesire and the absence of desire, with anger and the absence of anger, with righteousness and\nunrighteousness, with everything -\u2013identified, in fact, with this (what is perceived) and with that (what\nis inferred). As it does and acts, so it becomes; by doing good it becomes good, and by doing evil it\nbecomes evil \u2013 it becomes virtuous through good acts and vicious through evil acts. Others, however,\nsay, \u2018The self is identified with desire alone. What it desires, it resolves; what it resolves, it works out;\nand what it works out, it attains.\u2019\nIV-iv-6: Regarding this there is the following pithy verse: \u2018Being attached he, together with the work,\nattains that result to which his subtle body or mind is attached. Exhausting the results of whatever work\nhe did in this life, he returns from that world to this for (fresh) work\u2019. Thus does the man who desires\n(transmigrate). But the man who does not desire (never transmigrates). Of him who is without desires,\nwho is free from desires, the objects of whose desire have been attained, and to whom all objects of\ndesire are but the Self \u2013 the organs do not depart. Being but Brahman, he is merged in Brahman.\nIV-iv-7: Regarding this there is this pithy verse: \u2018When all the desires that dwell in his heart (mind) are\ngone, then he, having been mortal, becomes immortal, and attains Brahman in this very body\u2019. Just as\nthe lifeless Slough of a snake is cast off and lies in the ant-hill, so does this body lie. Then the self\nbecomes disembodied and immortal, (becomes) the Prana (Supreme Self), Brahman, the Light. \u2018I give\nyou a thousand (cows), sir\u2019, said Janaka, Emperor of Videha.\nIV-iv-8: Regarding this there are the following pithy verses: the subtle, extensive, ancient way has\ntouched (been reached by) me. (Nay) I have realised it myself. Through that sages \u2013 the knowers of\n\nBrahman \u2013 (also) go to the heavenly sphere (liberation) after the fall of this body, being freed (even\nwhile living).\nIV-iv-9: Some speak of it as white, others as blue, grey, green, or red. This path is realised by a\nBrahmana (knower of Brahman). Any other knower of Brahman who has done good deeds and is\nidentified with the Supreme Light, (also) treads this path.\nIV-iv-10: Into blinding darkness (ignorance) enter those who worship ignorance (rites). Into greater\ndarkness, as it were, than that enter those who are devoted to knowledge (the ceremonial portion of the\nVedas).\nIV-iv-11: Miserable are those worlds enveloped by (that) blinding darkness (ignorance). To them, after\ndeath, go those people who are ignorant and unwise.\nIV-iv-12: If a man knows the Self as \u2018I am this\u2019, then desiring what and for whose sake will he suffer in\nthe wake of the body ?\nIV-iv-13: He who has realised and intimately known the Self that has entered this perilous and\ninaccessible place (the body), is the maker of the universe, for he is the maker of all, (all is) his Self,\nand he again is indeed the Self (of all).\nIV-iv-14: Being in this very body we have somehow known that (Brahman). If not, (I should have\nbeen) ignorant, (and) great destruction (would have taken place). Those who know It become immortal,\nwhile others attain misery alone.\nIV-iv-15: When a man after (receiving instructions from a teacher) directly realises this effulgent Self,\nthe Lord of all that has been and will be, he no longer wishes to hide himself from it.\nIV-iv-16: Below which the year with its days rotates, upon that immortal Light of all lights the gods\nmeditate as longevity.\nIV-iv-17: That in which the five groups of five and the (subtle) ether are placed, that very Atman I\nregard as the immortal Brahman. Knowing (Brahman) I am immortal.\nIV-iv-18: Those who have known the Vital Force of the vital force, the Eye of the eye, the Ear of the\near, and the Mind of the mind, have realised the ancient, primordial Brahman.\nIV-iv-19: Through the mind alone (It) is to be realised. There is no difference whatsoever in It. He goes\nfrom death to death, who sees difference, as it were, in It.\nIV-iv-20: It should be realised in one form only, (for) It is unknowable and eternal. The Self is taintless,\nbeyond the (subtle) ether, birthless, infinite and constant.\nIV-iv-21: The intelligent aspirant after Brahman, knowing about this alone, should attain intuitive\nknowledge. (He) should not think of too many words, for it is particularly fatiguing to the organ of\nspeech.\nIV-iv-22: That great, birthless Self which is identified with the intellect and is in the midst of the\norgans, lies in the ether that is within the heart. It is the controller of all, the lord of all, the ruler of all.\nIt does not grow better through good work nor worse through bad work. It is the lord of all, It is the\nruler of all beings, It is the protector of all beings. It is the bank that serves as the boundary to keep the\ndifferent worlds apart. The Brahmanas seek to know It through the study of the Vedas, sacrifices,\ncharity, and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of sense-objects. Knowing It alone, one\nbecomes a sage. Desiring this world (the Self) alone, monks renounce their homes. This is (the reason\nfor it); The ancient sages, it is said, did not desire children (thinking), \u2018What shall we achieve through\nchildren, we who have attained this Self, this world (result).\u2019 They, it is said, renounced their desire for\nsons, for wealth and for the worlds, and lived a mendicant\u2019s life. That which is the desire for sons is the\ndesire for wealth, and that which is the desire for wealth is the desire for worlds, for both these are but\ndesires. This self is That which has been described as \u2018Not this, Not this\u2019. It is imperceptible, for It is\nnever perceived; undecaying, for It never decays; unattached, for It is never attached; unfettered \u2013 It\nnever feels pain, and never suffers injury. (it is but proper) that the sage is never overtaken by these two\nthoughts, \u2018I did an evil act for this\u2019, \u2018I did a good act for this\u2019. He conquers both of them. Things done\nor not done do not trouble him.\n\nIV-iv-23: This has been expressed by the following hymn: This is the eternal glory of a knower of\nBrahman: it neither increases nor decreases through work. (Therefore) one should know the nature of\nthat alone. Knowing it one is not touched by evil action. Therefore he who knows it as such becomes\nself-controlled, calm, withdrawn into himself, enduring and concentrated, and sees the self in his own\nself (body); he sees all as the Self. Evil does not overtake him, but he transcends all evil. Evil does not\ntrouble him, (but) he consumes all evil. He becomes sinless, taintless, free from doubts, and a\nBrahmana (knower of Brahman). This is the world of Brahman, O Emperor, and you have attained it \u2013\nsaid Yajnavalkya. \u2018I give you sir, the empire of Videha, and myself too with it, to wait upon you\u2019.\nIV-iv-24: That great, birthless Self is the eater of food and the giver of wealth (the fruits of one\u2019s work).\nHe who knows It as such receives wealth (those fruits).\nIV-iv-25: That great, birthless Self is undecaying, immortal, undying, fearless and Brahman (infinite).\nBrahman is indeed fearless. He who knows It as such certainly becomes the fearless Brahman.\nIV-v-1: Now Yajnavalkya had two wives, Maitreyi and Katyayani. Of these Maitreyi used to discuss\nBrahman, (while) Katyayani had then only an essentially feminine outlook. One day Yajnavalkya, with\na view to embracing life \u2013\nIV-v-2: \u2018O Maitreyi, my dear\u2019, said Yajnavalkya, \u2018I am going to renounce this life for monasticism.\nAllow me to finish between you and Katyayani\u2019.\nIV-v-3: Thereupon Maitreyi said, \u2018Sir, if indeed this whole earth full of wealth be mine, shall I be\nimmortal through that, or not ?\u2019 \u2018No\u2019, replied Yajnavalkya, \u2018your life will be just like that of people\nwho possess plenty of things, but there is no hope of immortality through wealth.\u2019\nIV-v-4: Then Maitreyi said, \u2018What shall I do with that which will not make me immortal ? Tell me, sir,\nof that alone which you know (to be the only means of immortality).\u2019\nIV-v-5: Yajnavalkya said, \u2018My dear, you have been my beloved (even before), and you have magnified\nwhat is after my heart. If you wish, my dear, I will explain it to you. As I explain it, meditate (upon its\nmeaning).\nIV-v-6: He said: \u2018It is not for the sake of the husband, my dear, that he is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake\nthat he is loved. It is not for the sake of the wife, my dear, that she is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that\nshe is loved. It is not for the sake of the sons, my dear, that they are loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that\nthey are loved. It is not for the sake of wealth, my dear, that it is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that it is\nloved. It is not for the sake of the Brahmana, my dear, that he is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that he is\nloved. It is not for the sake of the Kshatriya, my dear, that he is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that he is\nloved. It is not for the sake of worlds, my dear, that they are loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that they are\nloved. It is not for the sake of the gods, my dear, that they are loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that they\nare loved. It is not for the sake of beings, my dear, that they are loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that they\nare loved. It is not for the sake of all, my dear, that all is loved, but for one\u2019s own sake that it is loved.\nThe Self, my dear Maitreyi, should be realised \u2013 should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon.\nWhen the Self, my dear, is realised by being heard of, reflected on and meditated upon, all this is\nknown.\nIV-v-7: The Brahmana ousts (slights) one who knows him as different from the Self. The Kshatriya\nousts one who knows him as different from the Self. Worlds oust one who knows them as different\nfrom the Self. The gods oust one who knows them as different from the Self. The Vedas oust one who\nknows them as different from the Self. Beings oust one who knows them as different from the Self. All\nousts one who knows it as different from the Self. This Brahmana, this Kshatriya, these worlds, these\ngods, these Vedas, these beings and these all -- are this Self.\nIV-v-8: As, when a drum is beaten, one cannot distinguish its various particular notes, but they are\nincluded in the general note of the drum or in the general sound produced by different kinds of strokes.\nIV-v-9: As, when a conch is blown, one cannot distinguish its various particular notes, but they are\nincluded in the general note of the conch or in the general sound produced by different kinds of\n\nplaying.\nIV-v-10: As, when a Vina is played, one cannot distinguish its various particular notes, but they are\nincluded in the general note of the Vina or in the general sound produced by different kinds of playing.\nIV-v-11: As from a fire kindled with wet faggot diverse kinds of smoke issue, even so, my dear, the\nRig-Veda, Yajur-Veda, Sama-Veda, Atharvangirasa, history, mythology, arts, Upanishads, pithy verses,\naphorisms, elucidations, explanations, sacrifices, oblations in the fire, food, drink, this world, the next\nworld and all beings are (like) the breath of this infinite Reality. They are like the breath of this\n(Supreme Self).\nIV-v-12: As the ocean is the one goal of all sorts of water, as the skin is the one goal of all kinds of\ntouch, as the nostrils are the one goal of all odours, as the tongue is the one goal of all savours, as the\neye is the one goal of all colours , as the ear is the one goal of all sounds, as the Manas is the one goal\nof all deliberations, as the intellect is the one goal of all kinds of knowledge, as the hands are the one\ngoal of all sort of work, as the organ of generation is the one goal of all kinds of enjoyment, as the anus\nis the one goal of all excretions, as the feet are the one goal of all kinds of walking, as the organ of\nspeech is the one goal of all Vedas.\nIV-v-13: As a lump of salt is without interior or exterior, entire, and purely saline in taste, even so is the\nSelf without interior or exterior, entire, and Pure Intelligence alone. (The Self) comes out (as a separate\nentity) from these elements, and (this separateness) is destroyed with them. After attaining (this\noneness) it has no more consciousness. This is what I say, my dear. So said Yajnavalkya.\nIV-v-14: Maitreyi said, \u2018Just here you have led me into the midst of confusion, sir, I do not at all\ncomprehend this\u2019. He said, \u2018Certainly, I am not saying anything confusing. This self is indeed\nimmutable and indestructible, my dear\u2019.\nIV-v-15: Because when there is duality, as it were, then one sees something, one smells something, one\ntastes something, one speaks something, one hears something, one thinks something, one touches\nsomething, one knows something. (But) when to the knower of Brahman everything has become the\nSelf, then what should one see and through what, what should one smell and through what, what should\none taste and through what, what should one speak and through what, what should one hear and\nthrough what, what should one think and through what, what should one touch and through what, what\nshould one know and through what ? Through what should one know that owing to which all this is\nknown ? This self is That which has been described as \u2018Not this, Not this\u2019. It is imperceptible, for It is\nnever perceived; undecaying, for It never decays; unattached, for It is never attached; unfettered \u2013 it\nnever feels pain, and never suffers injury. Through what, O Maitreyi, should one know the Knower ?\nSo you have got the instruction, Maitreyi. This much indeed is (the means of) immortality, my dear.\nSaying this Yajnavalkya left.\nIV-vi-1: Now the line of teachers: Pautimasya (received it) from Gaupavana. Gaupavana from another\nPautimasya. This Pautimasya from another Gaupavana. This Gaupavana from Kausika. Kausika from\nKaundinya. Kaundinya from Sandilya. Sandilya from Kausika and Gautama.

That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite. The infinite proceeds from the\ninfinite. (Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe), it remains as the infinite (Brahman)\nalone. Om is the ether-Brahman \u2013 the eternal ether. \u2018The ether containing air,\u2019 says the son of\nKauravyayani. It is the Veda, (so) the Brahmans (knowers of Brahman) know; (for) through it one\nknows what is to be known.\nV-ii-1: Three classes of Prajapati\u2019s sons lived a life of continence with their father, Prajapati (Viraj) \u2013\nthe gods, men and Asuras. The gods, on the completion of their term, said, \u2018Please instruct us\u2019. He told\nthem the syllable \u2018Da\u2019 (and asked), \u2018have you understood ?\u2019 (They) said, \u2018We have. You tell us: Control\nyourselves\u2019. (He) said, \u2018Yes, you have understood\u2019.\nV-ii-2: Then the men said to him, \u2018Please instruct us\u2019. He told them the same syllable \u2018Da\u2019 (and asked),\n\u2018Have you understood ?\u2019 (They) said, \u2018We have. You tell us: Give\u2019. (He) said, \u2018Yes, you have\nunderstood\u2019.\nV-ii-3: Then the Asuras said to him, \u2018Please instruct us\u2019. He told them the same syllable \u2018Da\u2019 (and\nasked), \u2018Have you understood ?\u2019 (They) said, \u2018We have. You tell us: Have compassion\u2019. (He) said, \u2018Yes,\nyou have understood\u2019. That very thing is repeated by the heavenly voice, the cloud, as \u2018Da\u2019, \u2018Da\u2019, \u2018Da\u2019:\n\u2018Control yourselves\u2019, \u2018Give\u2019, and \u2018have compassion\u2019. Therefore one should learn these three \u2013 selfcontrol, charity and compassion.\nV-iii-1: This is Prajapati - this heart (intellect). It is Brahman, it is everything. \u2018Hridaya\u2019 (heart) has\nthree syllables. \u2018Hr\u2019 is one syllable. To him who knows as above, his own people and others bring\n(presents). \u2018Da\u2019 is another syllable. To him who knows as above, his own people and others give (their\npowers). \u2018Ya\u2019 is another syllable. He who knows as above goes to heaven.\nV-iv-1: That (intellect-Brahman) was but this \u2013 Satya (gross and subtle) alone. He who knows this\ngreat, adorable, first-born (being) as the Satya-Brahman, conquers these worlds, and his (enemy) is thus\nconquered and becomes non-existent \u2013 he who knows this great, adorable, first-born (being) thus, as\nthe Satya-Brahman, for Satya is indeed Brahman.\nV-v-1: This (universe) was but water (liquid oblations connected with sacrifices) in the beginning. That\nwater produced Satya. Satya is Brahman. Brahman (produced) Prajapati, and Prajapati the gods. Those\ngods meditate upon Satya alone. This (name) \u2018Satya\u2019 consists of three syllables: \u2018Sacrifice\u2019 is one\nsyllable, \u2018Ti\u2019 is another syllable, and \"Ya\u2019 is the third syllable. The first and last syllables are truth. In\nthe middle is untruth. This untruth is enclosed on either side by truth. (Hence) there is a preponderance\nof truth. One who knows as above is never hurt by untruth.\nV-v-2: That which is Satya is that sun \u2013 the being who is in that orb and the being who is in the right\neye. These two rest on each other. The former rests on the latter through the rays, and the latter rests on\nthe former through the function of the eyes. When a man is about to leave the body, he sees the solar\norb as clear. The rays no more come to him.\nV-v-3: Of this being who is in the solar orb, the syllable \u2018Bhur\u2019 is the head, for there is one head, and\nthere is this one syllable; the word \u2018Bhuvar\u2019 is the arms, for there are two arms, and there are these two\nsyllables; the word \u2018Svar\u2019 is the feet, for there are two feet, and there are these two syllables. His secret\nname is \u2018Ahar\u2019. He who knows as above destroys and shuns evil.\nV-v-4: Of this being who is in the right eye, the syllable \u2018Bhur\u2019 is the head, for there is one head, and\nthere is this one syllable; the word \u2018Bhuvar\u2019 is the arms, for there are two arms, and there are these two\n\nsyllables; the word \u2018Svar\u2019 is the feet, for there are two feet, and there are these two syllables. His secret\nname is \u2018Aham\u2019. He who knows as above destroys and shuns evil.\nV-vi-1: This being identified with the mind and resplendent (is realised by the Yogins) within the heart\nlike a grain of rice or barley. He is the lord of all, the ruler of all, and governs whatever there is.\nV-vii-1: They say lightning is Brahman. It is called lightning (Vidyut) because it scatters (darkness). He\nwho knows it as such \u2013 that lightning is Brahman \u2013 scatters evils (that are ranged against) him, for\nlightning is indeed Brahman.\nV-viii-1: One should meditate upon speech (the Vedas) as a cow (as it were). She has four teats \u2013 the\nsounds \"Svaha\u2019, \u2018Vasat\u2019, \u2018Hanta\u2019 and \u2018Svadha\u2019. The gods live on two of her teats \u2013 the sounds \u2018Svaha\u2019\nand \u2018Vasat\u2019, men on the sound \u2018Hanta\u2019, and the manes on the sound \u2018Svadha\u2019. Her bull is the vital\nforce, and her calf the mind.\nV-ix-1: This fire that is within a man and digests the food that is eaten, is Vaisvanara. It emits this\nsound that one hears by stopping the ears thus. When a man is about to leave the body, he no more\nhears this sound.\nV-x-1: When a man departs from this world, he reaches the air, which makes an opening there for him\nlike the hole of a chariot-wheel. He goes upwards through that and reaches the sun, who makes an\nopening there for him like the hole of a tabor. He goes upwards through that and reaches the moon,\nwho makes an opening there for him like the hole of a drum. He goes upwards through that and reaches\na world free from grief and from cold. He lives there for eternal years.\nV-xi-1: This indeed is excellent austerity that a man suffers when he is ill. He who knows as above\nwins an excellent world. This indeed is excellent austerity that a man after death is carried to the forest.\nHe who knows as above wins an excellent world. This indeed is excellent austerity that a man after\ndeath is placed in the fire. He who knows as above wins an excellent world.\nV-xii-1: Some say that food is Brahman. It is not so, for food rots without the vital force. Others say\nthat the vital force is Brahman. It is not so, for the vital force dries up without food. But these two\ndeities being united attain their highest. So Pratrda said to his father, \u2018What good indeed can I do to one\nwho knows like this, and what evil indeed can I do to him either?\u2019 The father, with a gesture of the\nhand, said, \u2018Of, no, Pratrda, for who would attain his highest by being identified with them ?\u2019 Then he\nsaid to him this: \u2018It is \"Vi\". Food is \"vi\", for all these creatures rest on food. It is \"Ram\". The vital force\nis \"Ram\", for all these creatures delight if there is the vital force\u2019. On him who knows as above all\ncreatures rest, and in him all creatures delight.\nV-xiii-1: (One should meditate upon the vital force as) the Uktha (a hymn of praise). The vital force is\nthe Uktha, for it raises this universe. From him who knows as above rises a son who is a knower of the\nvital force, and he achieves union with and abode in the same world as the Uktha.\nV-xiii-2: (One should meditate upon the vital force as) the Yajus. The vital force is the Yajus, for all\nthese beings are joined with one another if there is the vital force. All beings are joined for the\neminence of him who knows as above, and he achieves union with and abode in the same world as the\nYajus (vital force).\nV-xiii-3: (One should meditate upon the vital force as) the Saman. The vital force is the Saman, for all\nthese beings are united if there is the vital force. For him who knows as above all beings are united, and\nthey succeed in bringing about his eminence, and he achieves union with abode in the same world as\nthe Saman.\nV-xiii-4: (One should meditate upon the vital force as) the Ksatra. The vital force is the Ksatra, for it is\n\nindeed the Ksatra. The vital force protects the body from wounds. He who knows as above attains this\nKsatra (vital force) that has no other protector, and achieves union with and abode in the same world as\nthe Ksatra.\nV-xiv-1: \u2018Bhumi\u2019 (the earth), \u2018Antariksa\u2019 (sky) and \u2018Dyaus\u2019 (heaven) make eight syllables, and the first\nfoot of the Gayatri has eight syllables. So the above three worlds constitute the first foot of the Gayatri.\nHe who knows the first foot of the Gayatri to be such wins as much as there is in those three worlds.\nV-xiv-2: \u2018Reah\u2019, \u2018Yajumsi\u2019 and \u2018Samani\u2019 make eight syllables, and the second foot of the Gayatri has\neight syllables. So the above three Vedas constitute the second foot of the Gayatri. He who knows the\nsecond foot of the Gayatri to be such wins as much as that treasury of knowledge, the three Vedas, has\nto confer.\nV-xiv-3: \u2018Prana\u2019, \u2018Apana\u2019 and \u2018Vyana\u2019 make eight syllables, and the third foot of the Gayatri has eight\nsyllables. So the above three forms of vital force constitute the third foot of the Gayatri. He who knows\nthe third foot of the Gayatri to be such wins all the living beings that are in the universe. Now its\nTuriya, apparently visible, supramundane foot is indeed this \u2013 the sun that shines. \u2018Turiya\u2019 means the\nfourth. \u2018Apparently visible foot\u2019, because he is seen, as it were. \u2018Supramundane\u2019, because he shines on\nthe whole universe as its overlord. He who knows the fourth foot of the Gayatri to be such shines in the\nsame way with splendour and fame.\nV-xiv-4: That Gayatri rests on this fourth, apparently visible, supramundane foot. That again rests on\ntruth. The eye is truth, for the eye is indeed truth. Therefore if even today two persons come disputing,\none saying, \u2018I saw it\u2019, and another, \u2018I heard of it\u2019, we believe him only who says, \u2018I saw it\u2019. That truth\nrests on strength. The vital force is strength. (Hence) truth rests on the vital force. Therefore they say\nstrength is more powerful than truth. Thus the Gayatri rests on the vital force within the body. That\nGayatri saved the Gayas. The organs are the Gayas; so it saved the organs. Now, because it saved the\norgans, therefore it is called the Gayatri. The Savitri that the teacher communicates to the pupil is no\nother than this. It saves the organs of him to whom it is communicated.\nV-xiv-5: Some communicate (to the pupil) the Savitri that is Anustubh (saying), \u2018speech is Anustubh;\nwe shall impart that to him\u2019. One should not do like that. One should communicate that Savitri which is\nthe Gayatri. Even if a man who knows as above accepts too much as gift, as it were, it is not (enough)\nfor even one foot of the Gayatri.\nV-xiv-6: He who accepts these three worlds replete (with wealth), will be receiving (the results of\nknowing) only the first foot of the Gayatri. He who accepts as much as this treasury of knowledge, the\nVedas (has to confer), will receive (the results of knowing) only its second foot. And he who accepts as\nmuch as (is covered by) all living beings, will receive (the results of knowing) only its third foot. With\nits fourth, apparently visible, supramundane foot \u2013 the sun that shines \u2013 is not to be counter balanced by\nany gift received. Indeed how could any one accept so much as gift ?\nV-xiv-7: Its salutation: \u2018O Gayatri, thou art one-footed, two-footed, there-footed and four-footed, and\nthou art without any feet, for thou art unattainable. Salutation to thee, the fourth, apparently visible,\nsupramundane foot ! May the enemy never attain his object !\u2019 (Should the knower of the Gayatri) bear\nhatred towards anybody, (he should) either (use this Mantra): \u2018Such and such \u2013 way his desired object\nnever flourish!\u2019 \u2013 in which case that object of the person against whom he thus salutes the Gayatri,\nnever flourishes \u2013 or (he may say), \u2018May I attain that (cherished object) of his!\u2019\nV-xiv-8: On this Janaka, Emperor of Videha, is said to have told Budila, the son of Asvatarasva, \u2018Well,\nyou gave yourself out as a knower of the Gayatri; then why, alas, are you carrying (me) as an\nelephant ?\u2019 He replied, \u2018Because I did not know its mouth, O Emperor\u2019. \u2018Fire is its mouth. Even if they\nput a large quantity of fuel into the fire, it is all burnt up. Similarly, even if one who knows as above\ncommits a great many sins, he consumes them all and becomes pure, cleansed, undecaying and\nimmortal\u2019.\n\nV-xv-1: The face (nature) of Satya (Brahman) is hidden (as it were) with a golden vessel. O Pusan\n(nourisher of the world \u2013 the sun), remove it, so that I, whose reality is Satya, may see (the face). O\nPusan, O solitary Rishi (seer or traveller), O Yama (controller), O Surya (sun), O son of Prajapati (God\nor Hiranyagarbha), take away thy rays, curb thy brightness. I wish to behold that most benignant form\nof thine. I myself am that person; and I am immortal. (When my body falls) may my vital force return\nto the air (cosmic force), and this body too, reduced to ashes, (go to the earth)! O fire, who art the\nsyllable \u2018Om\u2019, O Deity of deliberations, recollect, recollect all that I have done, O Deity of\ndeliberations, recollect, recollect all that I have done. O Fire, lead us along the good way towards our\nriches (deserts). O Lord, thou knowest everybody\u2019s mental states; remove the wily evil from us. We\nutter repeated salutations to thee.\nVI-i-1: Om. He who knows that which is the oldest and greatest, becomes the oldest and greatest\namong his relatives. The vital force is indeed the oldest and greatest. He who knows it to be such\nbecomes the oldest and greatest among his relatives as well as among those of whom he wants to be\nsuch.\nVI-i-2: He who knows the Vasistha (that which best helps to dwell or cover) becomes the Vasistha\namong his relatives. The organ of speech is indeed the Vasistha. He who knows it as such becomes the\nVasistha among his relatives as well as among those of whom he wants to be such.\nVI-i-3: He who knows Pratistha (that which has steadiness) lives steadily in difficult as well as smooth\nplaces and times. The eye indeed is Pratistha, for through the eye one lives steadily in difficult as well\nas smooth places and times. He who knows it as such lives steadily in difficult as well as smooth places\nand times.\nVI-i-4: He who knows Sampad (prosperity) attains whatever object he desires. The ear indeed is\nSampad, for all these Vedas are acquired when one has the ear (intact). He who knows it to be such\nattains whatever object he desires.\nVI-i-5: He who knows the abode becomes the abode of his relatives as well as of (other) people. The\nManas indeed is the abode. He who knows it to be such becomes the abode of his relatives as well as of\n(other) people.\nVI-i-6: He who knows Prajati (that which has the attribute of generation) is enriched with children and\nanimals. The seed (organ) has this attribute. He who knows it to be such is enriched with children and\nanimals.\nVI-i-7: These organs, disputing over their respective greatness, went to Brahman and said to him,\n\u2018Which of us is the Vasistha ?\u2019 He said, \u2018That one of you will be the Vasistha, who departing from\namong yourselves, people consider this body far more wretched\u2019.\nVI-i-8: The organ of speech went out. After staying a whole year out it came back and said, \u2018How did\nyou manage to live without me ?\u2019 They said, \u2018We lived just as dumb people do, without speaking\nthrough the organ of speech, but living through the vital force, seeing through the eye, hearing through\nthe ear, knowing through the mind and having children through the organ of generation.\u2019 So the organ\nof speech entered.\nVI-i-9: The eye went out. After staying a whole year out it came back and said, \u2018How did you manage\nto live without me ?\u2019 They said, \u2018We lived just as blind people do, without seeing through the eye, but\nliving through the vital force, speaking through the organ of speech, hearing through the ear, knowing\nthrough the mind and having children through the organ of generation.\u2019 So the eye entered.\nVI-i-10: The ear went out. After staying a whole year out it came back and said, \u2018How did you manage\nto live without me ?\u2019 They said, \u2018We lived just as deaf people do, without hearing through the ear, but\nliving through the vital force, speaking through the organ of speech, seeing through the eye, knowing\nthrough the mind and having children through the organ of generation.\u2019 So the ear entered.\nVI-i-11: The mind went out. After staying a whole year out it came back and said, \u2018How did you\nmanage to live without me ?\u2019 They said, \u2018We lived just as idiots do, without knowing through the mind,\n\nbut living through the vital force, speaking through the organ of speech, seeing through the eye, hearing\nthrough the ear and having children through the organ of generation.\u2019 So the mind entered.\nVI-i-12: The organ of generation went out. After staying a whole year out it came back and said, \u2018How\ndid you manage to live without me ?\u2019 They said, \u2018We lived just as eunuchs do, without having children\nthrough the organ of generation, but living through the vital force, speaking through the organ of\nspeech, seeing through the eye, hearing through the ear and knowing through the mind.\u2019 So the organ of\ngeneration entered.\nVI-i-13: Then as the vital force was about to go out, it uprooted those organs just as a great, fine horse\nfrom Sind pulls out the pegs to which his feet are tied. They said, \u2018Please do not go out, sir, we cannot\nlive without you\u2019. \u2018Then give me tribute.\u2019 \u2018All right\u2019.\nVI-i-14: The organ of speech said, \u2018That attribute of the Vasistha which I have is yours\u2019. The eye: \u2018That\nattribute of steadiness which I have is yours\u2019. The ear: \u2018That attribute of prosperity which I have is\nyours\u2019. The mind: \u2018That attribute of abode which I have is yours\u2019. The organ of generation: \u2018That\nattribute of generation which I have is yours\u2019. (The vital force said:) \u2018Then what will be my food and\nmy dress ?\u2019 (The organs said:) \u2018Whatever is (known as) food, including dogs, worms, insects and\nmoths, is your food, and water your dress\u2019. He who knows the food of the vital force to be such, never\nhappens to eat anything that is not food, or to accept anything that is not food. Therefore wise men who\nare versed in the Vedas sip a little water just before and after eating. They regard it as removing the\nnakedness of the vital force.\nVI-ii-1: Svetaketu, the grandson of Aruna, came to the assembly of the Panchalas. He approached\nPravahana, the son of Jivala, who was being waited on (by his servants). Seeing him the King\naddressed him, \u2018Boy !\u2019 He replied, \u2018Yes, sir\u2019. \u2018Have you been taught by your father ?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes\u2019.\nVI-ii-2: \u2018Do you know how these people diverge after death ?\u2019 \u2018No\u2019, said he. \u2018Do you know how they\nreturn to this world ?\u2019 \u2018No\u2019, said he. \u2018Do you know how the other world is never filled by so many\npeople dying thus again and again ?\u2019 \u2018No\u2019, said he. \u2018Do you know after how many oblations are offered\nwater (the liquid offerings) rises up possessed of a human voice (or under the name of man) and speaks\n?\u2019 \u2018No\u2019, said he. \u2018Do you know the means of access to the way of the gods, or that to the way of the\nmanes \u2013 doing which people attain either the way of the gods or the way of the manes ? We have heard\nthe words of the Mantra: \u2018I have heard of two routes for men, leading to the manes and the gods. Going\nalong them all this is united. They lie between the father and the mother (earth and heaven).\"\u2019 He said,\n\u2018I know not one of them\u2019.\nVI-ii-3: Then the King invited him to stay. The boy, disregarding the invitation to stay, hurried away.\nHe came to his father and said to him, \u2018Well, did you not tell me before that you had (fully) instructed\nme ?\u2019 \u2018How (did you get hurt), my sagacious child ?\u2019 \u2018That wretch of a Kshatriya asked me five\nquestions, and I knew not one of them.\u2019 \u2018Which are they ?\u2019 \u2018These\u2019, and he quoted their first words.\nVI-ii-4: The father said, \u2018My child, believe me, whatever I knew I told you every bit of it. But come, let\nus go there and live as students\u2019. \u2018You go alone, please\u2019. At this Gautama came to where King\nPravahana, the son of Jivala, was giving audience. The King gave him a seat, had water brought for\nhim, and made him the reverential offering. Then he said, \u2018We will give revered Gautama, a boon\u2019.\nVI-ii-5: Aruni said, \u2018You have promised me this boon. Please tell me what you spoke to my boy about\u2019.\nVI-ii-6: The King said, \u2018This comes under heavenly boons, Gautama. Please ask some human boon\u2019.\nVI-ii-7: Aruni said, \u2018You know that I already have gold, cattle and horses, maid-servants, retinue, and\ndress. Be not ungenerous towards me alone regarding this plentiful, infinite and inexhaustible (wealth).\u2019\n\u2018Then you must seek it according to form, Gautama\u2019. \u2018I approach you (as a student)\u2019. The ancients used\nto approach a teacher simply through declaration. Aruni lived as a student by merely announcing that\nhe was at his service.\nVI-ii-8: The King said: Please do not take offence with us, Gautama, as your paternal grandfathers did\nnot (with ours). Before this, this learning never rested with a Brahmana. But I shall teach it to you; for\n\nwho can refuse you when you speak like this ?\nVI-ii-9: That word (heaven), O Gautama, is fire, the sun is its fuel, the rays its smoke, the day its flame,\nthe four quarters its cinder, and the intermediate quarters its sparks. In this fire the gods offer faith\n(liquid oblations in subtle form). Out of that offering King Moon is born (a body is made in the moon\nfor the sacrificer).\nVI-ii-10: Parjanya (the god of the rain), O Gautama, is fire, the year is its fuel, the clouds its smoke,\nlightning its flame, thunder its cinder, and the rumblings its sparks. In this fire the gods offer King\nMoon. Out of that offering rain is produced.\nVI-ii-11: This world, O Gautama, is fire, the earth is its fuel, fire its smoke, the night its flame, the\nmoon its cinder, and stars its sparks. In this fire the gods offer rain. Out of that offering food is\nproduced.\nVI-ii-12: Man, O Gautama, is fire, the open mouth is its fuel, the vital force its smoke, speech its flame,\nthe eye its cinder, and the ear its sparks. In this fire the gods offer food. Out of that offering the seed is\nproduced.\nVI-ii-13: Woman, O Gautama, is fire. In this fire the gods offer the seed. Out of that offering a man is\nborn. He lives as long as he is destined to live. Then, when he dies -VI-ii-14: They carry him to be offered in the fire. The fire becomes his fire, the fuel his fuel, the smoke\nhis smoke, the flame his flame, the cinder his cinder, and the sparks his sparks. In this fire the gods\noffer the man. Out of that offering the man emerges radiant.\nVI-ii-15: Those who know this as such, and those others who meditate with faith upon the SatyaBrahman in the forest, reach the deity identified with the flame, from him the deity of the day, from\nhim the deity of the fortnight in which the moon waxes, from him the deities of the six months in which\nthe sun travels northward, from them the deity identified with the world of the gods, from him the sun,\nand from the sun the deity of lightning. (Then) a being created from the mind (of Hiranyagarbha)\ncomes and conducts them to the worlds of Hiranyagarbha. They attain perfection and live in those\nworlds of Hiranyagarbha for a great many superfine years. They no more return to this world.\nVI-ii-16: While those who conquer the worlds through sacrifices, charity and austerity, reach the deity\nof smoke, from him the deity of the night, from him the deity of the fortnight in which the moon wanes,\nfrom him the deities of the six months in which the sun travels southward, from them the deity of the\nworld of the manes, and from him the moon. Reaching the moon they become food. There the gods\nenjoy them as the priests drink the shining Soma juice (gradually, saying, as it were), \u2018Flourish,\ndwindle\u2019. And when their past work is exhausted, they reach (become like) this ether, from the ether air,\nfrom air rain, and from rain the earth. Reaching the earth they become food. Then they are again\noffered in the fire of man, thence in the fire of woman, whence they are born (and perform rites) with a\nview to going to other worlds. Thus do they rotate. While those others who do not know these two\nways become insects and moths, and these frequently biting things (gnats and mosquitoes).\nVI-iii-1: He who wishes to attain greatness (should perform) on an auspicious day in a fortnight in\nwhich the moon waxes, and under a male constellation, during the northward march of the sun, (a\nsacrifice in the following manner): He should undertake for twelve days a vow connected with the\nUpasads (i.e. live on milk), collect in a cup of bowl made of fig wood all herbs and their grains, sweep\nand plaster (the ground), purify the offerings in the prescribed manner, interpose the Mantha (paste\nmade of those things), and offer oblations with the following Mantras: \u2018O Fire, to all those gods under\nyou, who spitefully frustrate men\u2019s desires, I offer their share. May they, being satisfied, satisfy me\nwith all objects of desire ! Svaha. To that all-procuring deity who turns out spiteful under your\nprotection, thinking she is the support of all, I offer this stream of clarified butter. Svaha\u2019.\nVI-iii-2: Offering oblations in the fire saying, \u2018Svaha to the oldest, Svaha to the greatest\u2019, he dips the\nremnant adhering to the ladle into the paste.

You combine everything in yourself. You are the sound\n\u2018Him\u2019, and are uttered as \u2018Him\u2019 (in the sacrifice by the Prastotr). You are the Udgitha and are chanted\n(by the Udgatr). You are recited (by the Adhvaryu) and recited back (by the Agnidhra). You are fully\nablaze in a humid (cloud). You are omnipresent, and master. You are food (as the moon), and light (as\nfire). You are death, and you are that in which all things merge\u2019.\nVI-iii-5: Then he takes it up saying, \u2018You know all (as the vital force); we too are aware of your\ngreatness. The vital force is the king, the lord, the ruler. May it make me king, lord and ruler !\u2019\nVI-iii-6: Then he drinks it saying, \u2018The radiant sun is adorable --; The winds are blowing sweetly, the\nrivers are shedding honey, may the herbs be sweet unto us ! Svaha to the earth. Glory we meditate\nupon; May the nights and days be charming, and the dust of the earth be sweet, may heaven, our father,\nbe gracious ! Svaha to the sky. May he direct our intellect; May the Soma creeper be sweet unto us,\nmay the sun be kind, may the quarters be helpful to us ! Svaha to heaven\u2019. Then he repeats the whole\nGayatri and the whole Madhumati, and says at the end, \u2018May I be all this ! Svaha to the earth, sky and\nheaven.\u2019 Then he drinks the whole remnant, washes his hands, and lies behind the fire with his head to\nthe east. In the morning he salutes the sun saying, \u2018Thou art the one lotus of the quarters; may I be the\none lotus of men !\u2019 Then he returns the way he went, sits behind the fire, and repeats the line of\nteachers.\nVI-iii-7: Uddalaka, the son of Aruni, taught this to his pupil Yajnavalkya, the Vajasaneya, and said,\n\u2018Should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves sprout\u2019.\nVI-iii-8: The Yajnavalkya, the Vajasaneya, taught this to his pupil Madhuka, the son of Paingi and said,\n\u2018Should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves sprout\u2019.\nVI-iii-9: Madhuka, the son of Paingi, again taught this to his pupil Cula, the son of Bhagavitta, and\nsaid, \u2018Should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves sprout\u2019.\nVI-iii-10: Then Cula, the son of Bhagavitta, taught this to his pupil Janaki, the son of Ayasthuna, and\nsaid, \u2018Should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves sprout\u2019.\nVI-iii-11: Janaki, the son of Ayasthuna, again taught this to Satyakama, the son of Jabala, and said,\n\u2018Should one sprinkle it even on a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves sprout\u2019.\nVI-iii-12: And Satyakama, the son of Jabala, in his turn, taught this to his pupils and said, \u2018Should one\nsprinkle it even on a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves sprout\u2019. One must not teach this to\nanyone but a son or a pupil.\nVI-iii-13: Four things are made of fig wood: the ladle, the bowl, the fuel and the two mixing rods. The\ncultivated grains are ten in number: Rice, barley, sesame, beans, Anu, Priyangu, wheat, lentils, pulse\nand vetches. They should be crushed and soaked in curds, honey and clarified butter, and offered as an\noblation.\n\nVI-iv-1: The earth is the essence of all these beings, water the essence of the earth, herbs of water,\nflowers of herbs, fruits of flowers, man of fruits, and the seed of man.\nVI-iv-2: Prajapati thought, \u2018Well, let me make an abode for it\u2019, and he created woman.\nVI-iv-3: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nVI-iv-4: Knowing verily this, Uddalaka, the son of Aruna, Naka, the son of Mudgala, and Kumaraharita\nsaid, \u2018Many men -Brahmanas only in name \u2013 who have union without knowing as above, depart from\nthis world impotent and bereft of merits\u2019.\nVI-iv-5: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nVI-iv-6: If man sees his reflection in water, he should recite the following Mantra: \u2018(May the gods\ngrant) me lustre, manhood, reputation, wealth and merits\u2019. She (his wife) is indeed the goddess of\nbeauty among women. Therefore he should approach this handsome woman and speak to her.\nVI-iv-7: If she is not willing, he should buy her over; and if she is still unyielding, he should strike her\nwith a stick or with the hand and proceed, uttering the following Mantra, 'I take away your reputation\u2019,\netc. She is then actually discarded.\nVI-iv-8: If she is willing, he should proceed, uttering the following Mantra: \u2018I transmit reputation into\nyou\u2019, and they both become reputed.\nVI-iv-9: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nVI-iv-10: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nVI-iv-11: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nVI-iv-12: If a man\u2019s wife has a lover whom he wishes to injure, he should put the fire in an unbaked\nearthen vessel, spread stalks of reed and Kusa grass in an inverse way, and offer the reed tips, soaked in\nclarified butter, in the fire in an inverse way, saying, \u2018Thou hast sacrificed in my kindled fire, I take\naway thy Prana and Apana \u2013 such and such. Thou hast sacrificed in my kindled fire, I take away thy\nsons and animals \u2013 such and such. Thou hast sacrificed in my kindled fire, I take away thy Vedic rites\nand those done according to the Smriti \u2013 such and such. Thou hast sacrificed in my kindled fire, I take\naway thy hopes and expectations \u2013 such and such\u2019. The man whom a Brahmana with knowledge of this\nceremony curses, departs from this world emasculated and shorn of his merits. Therefore one should\nnot wish even to cut jokes with the wife of a Vedic scholar who knows this ceremony, for he who has\nsuch knowledge becomes an enemy.\nVI-iv-13: If anybody\u2019s wife has the monthly sickness, she should drink of three days out of a cup\n(Kamsa). No Sudra man or woman should touch her. After three nights she should bathe, put on a new\ncloth, and be put to thresh rice.\nVI-iv-14: He who wishes that his son should be born fair, study one Veda and attain a full term of life,\nshould have rice cooked in milk, and he and his wife should eat it with clarified butter. Then they\nwould be able to produce such a son.\nVI-iv-15: He who wishes that his son should be born tawny or brown, study two Vedas and attain a full\nterm of life, should have rice cooked in curd, and he and his wife should eat it with clarified butter.\nThen they would be able to produce such a son.\nVI-iv-16: He who wishes that his son should be born dark with red eyes, study three Vedas and attain a\nfull term of life, should have rice cooked in water and he and his wife should eat with clarified butter.\nThen they would be able to produce such a son.\nVI-iv-17: He who wishes that a daughter should be born to him who would be a scholar and attain a\nfull term of life, should have rice cooked with sesame, and he and his wife should eat it with clarified\nbutter. Then they would be able to produce such a daughter.\nVI-iv-18: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nVI-iv-19: In the very morning he purifies the clarified butter according to the mode of Sthalipaka, and\noffers Sthalipaka oblations again and again, saying, \u2018Svaha to fire, Svaha to Anumati, Svaha to the\nradiant sun who produces infallible results\u2019. After offering, he takes up (the remnant of the cooked\nfood), eats part of it and gives the rest to his wife. Then he washes his hands, fills the water-vessel and\n\nsprinkles her thrice with that water, saying. \u2018Get up from here, Visvavasu, and find out another young\nwoman (who is) with her husband.\u2019\nVI-iv-20: He embraces her saying, \u2018I am the vital force, and you are speech; you are speech, and I am\nthe vital force; I am Saman, and you are Rik; I am heaven, and you are the earth; come, let us strive\ntogether so that we may have a male child.\u2019\nVI-iv-21: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nVI-iv-22: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nVI-iv-23: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nVI-iv-24: When (the son) is born, he should bring in the fire, take him in his lap, put a mixture of curd\nand clarified butter in a cup, and offer oblations again and again with that, saying, \u2018Growing in this\nhome of mine (as the son), may I maintain a thousand people ! May (the goddess of fortune) never\ndepart with children and animals from his line ! Svaha. The vital force that is in me, I mentally transfer\nto you. Svaha. If I have done anything too much or to little in this ceremony, may the all-knowing\nbeneficent fire make it just right for me \u2013 neither too much nor too little ! Svaha.\u2019\nVI-iv-25: Then putting (his mouth) to the child\u2019s right ear, he should thrice repeat, \u2018Speech, speech\u2019.\nNext mixing curd, honey and clarified butter, he feeds him with (a strip of) gold not obstructed (by\nanything), saying, \u2018I put the earth into you, I put the sky into you, I put heaven into you, I put the whole\nof the earth, sky and heaven into you\u2019.\nVI-iv-26: The he gives him a name, \u2018You are Veda (knowledge)\u2019. That is his secret name.\nVI-iv-27: Then he hands him to his mother to be suckled, saying, \u2018Offering Sarasvati, that breast of\nthine which is stored with results, is the sustainer of all, full of milk, the obtainer of wealth (one\u2019s\ndeserts) and generous, and through which thou nourishest all who are worthy of it (the gods etc.) \u2013\ntransfer that here (to my wife, for my babe) to suck\u2019.\nVI-iv-28: Then he addressed the mother: \u2018You are the adorable Arundhati, the wife of Vasistha; you\nhave brought forth a male child with the help of me, who am a man. Be the mother of many sons, for\nyou have given us a son\u2019. Of him who is born as the child of a Brahmana with this particular\nknowledge, they say, \u2018You have exceeded your father, and you have exceeded your grandfather. You\nhave reached the extreme limit of attainment through your splendour, fame and Brahmanical power.\u2019\nVI-v-1: Now the line of teachers: The son of Pautimsa (received it) from the son of Katyayani.

Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Brihadaranyopanishad, as contained in the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.\n\nBrihadaranyaka Upanishad Commentary\nCommentary on the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\u2013by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n\nCorrecting Our Ideas About Brahman\nNow we come to the oldest upanishadic dialogue between teacher and student. Gargya, the student, will\nspeak the truth, but without exact perception. That is, his statements will be either partial, skewed, or\nnot of dead-center accuracy. So I will not stay much about what he says, but concentrate on what the\nteacher Ajatasatru will say in correcting his statements\u2013which are not false, but imperfect and lacking.\n(All through this discourse Ajatasatru\u2019s disagreements with Gargya are only that Gargya aims much to\nlow in his views of reality, whereas Ajatasatru keeps insisting on viewing Reality\u2013Brahman\u2013not Its\nmanifestations or appearances.)\nIt must also be kept in mind that when Ajatasatru speaks of \u201cchildren\u201d or \u201cprogeny\u201d he is speaking of\nthe progeny of the illumined mind. Just as the scriptures speak of \u201cthe mind-born sons of Brahma\u201d so\neach of has mind-born offspring, symbolically speaking. Thoughts, words, and deeds, are all our\n\u201cchildren.\u201d\nThe pride of ignorance\n\u201cGargya, son of Valaka, was a good talker, but exceedingly vain. Coming one day into the\npresence of Ajatasatru, king of Varanasi, he accosted him with boastful speech. Gargya said: \u2018I\nwill teach you of Brahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru said: \u2018Indeed? Well, just for that kind proposal you\nshould be rewarded with a thousand cows. People nowadays flock to King Janaka to speak and\n\nhear of Brahman; I am pleased that you have come to me instead.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\n2:1:1)\nThe Sanskrit text actually says: \u201cThere was a man of the Garga family called Proud Balaki, who was\neloquent.\u201d Shankara comments that he was \u201c\u2018Proud\u2019 because of his very ignorance about the real\nBrahman.\u201d We see this a lot in every area of life, not just religion. As someone once said: \u201cThe problem\nwith ignorance is that it picks up confidence as it goes along.\u201d It has been my observation that the more\nconfidence some people possess, the more ignorant they are. When they speak with bullying assurance\nthey should never be believed. This has saved me from a lot of potentially disastrous situations.\nAs has been the practice in nearly all ancient cultures, at that time cows were prized so highly as to\neven be a medium of exchange, often preferred to money. (It is interesting that the oldest money found\nin England are huge blocks of metal embossed with the figure of a cow to indicate that each one\npossesses the value of one cow.)\nJanaka was, as A Brief Sanskrit Glossary says: \u201cThe royal sage (raja rishi) who was the king of Mithila\nand a liberated yogi, a highly sought-after teacher of philosophy in ancient India.\u201d So it was very\npleasing to Ajatasatru that someone would approach him for philosophical discourse. However, Gargya\ncame to teach and instead was taught\u2013fortunate man! The fact that he was amenable to being taught\nindicates that his pride was really harmless, like the pride of a child. This is a trait of a sattwic mind.\nTranscendent and transcending knowledge\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018He who is the being in the sun and at the same time the being in the eye; he who,\nhaving entered the body through the eye, resides in the heart and is the doer and the\nexperiencer\u2013him I meditate upon as Brahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru said: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of\nBrahman. That being I worship as transcendental, luminous, supreme. He who meditates upon\nBrahman as such goes beyond all created beings and becomes the glorious ruler of all.\u2019\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:2)\nIt is certainly true that Brahman is all-pervading and therefore immanent in all creation, but It is much\nmore, and those further attributes are the ones so necessary for the aspiring yogi to learn. That which\nGargya said can be held by any devoted religious person in ignorance. But Ajatasatru\u2019s assertions are\n\u201cthe last word\u201d in the matter, both as to the true nature of Brahman and that which he will himself\nbecome who comes to know this of Brahman by the direct experience possible only to adept yogis.\nBrahman is not confined to this present world-experience, and neither are we in our true nature. This\nmust be realized if we would be free (mukta).\nBeyond the mind\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018The being who is in the moon and at the same time in the mind\u2013him I meditate\nupon as Brahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru said: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of Brahman. That being I\nworship as infinite, clad in purity, blissful, resplendent. He who meditates upon Brahman as\nsuch lacks nothing and is forever happy.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:3)\nBrahman is certainly in the mind [manas], but cannot be grasped by the mind, for it is an instrument of\nillusory perception. The intellect [buddhi] can be so purified that it becomes a mirror-reflection of\nSpirit-Being\u2013which is why the Gita emphasizes Buddhi Yoga. The buddhi can perceive Brahman \u201cas\ninfinite, clad in purity, blissful, resplendent.\u201d Such is the gateway to the fulfillment of all right desires\nand unbroken bliss.\n\nOmnipotence\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018The being who is in the lightning and at the same time in the heart\u2013him I\nmeditate upon as Brahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru said: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of Brahman. That\nbeing I worship as power. He who meditates upon Brahman as such becomes powerful, and his\nchildren after him.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:4)\nWe see astounding phenomena in creation, but they are only appearances, however wondrous. Brahman\nis their source, but It is the Power that produces those phenomena, It is their foundation without which\nthey could not occur. Brahman is unlimited Potential. And so are those who come to know Brahman.\nOmnipresence\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018The being who is in the sky and at the same time in the heart\u2013him I meditate\nupon as Brahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru said: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of Brahman. That being I\nworship as all-pervading, changeless. He who meditates upon Brahman as such is blessed with\nchildren and with cattle. The thread of his progeny shall never be cut.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka\nUpanishad 2:1:5)\nBrahman is not just in a lot of places, Brahman is everywhere and within all things, for It IS all things.\nAnd this all-pervasiveness is eternal\u2013has been so forever.\nInvincible\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018The being who is in the wind and who at the same time is the breath within\u2013him\nI meditate upon as Brahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru said: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of Brahman. That\nbeing I worship as the Lord, invincible and unconquerable. He who meditates upon Brahman as\nsuch becomes himself invincible and unconquerable.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:6)\nWind and breath wax, wane, and cease\u2013Brahman never does. It cannot be even affected by anything,\nmuch less controlled.\nForbearing\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018The being who is in the fire and at the same time in the heart\u2013him I meditate\nupon as Brahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru said: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of Brahman. That being I\nworship as forgiving [forbearing]. He who meditates upon Brahman as such becomes himself\nforgiving, and his children after him.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:7)\nThe idea here is that, being within all things, Brahman experiences all that happens to them. That is\nwhy Bishop James I. Wedgwood, an adherent of Advaita Vedanta, wrote the prayer he called An Act of\nUnion: \u201cUnto Thee, O Perfect One, the Lord and Lover of men, do we commend our life and hope. For\nThou art the Heavenly Bread, the Life of the whole world; Thou art in all places and endurest all\nthings, the Treasury of endless good and the Well of infinite compassion.\u201d Brahman is not just in many\nthings, It is the Consciousness inside of all things as the Infinite Witness.\nHarmony\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018The being who is in the water and at the same time in the heart\u2013him I meditate\nupon as Brahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru said: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of Brahman. That being I\nworship as harmony. He who meditates upon Brahman as such knows only what is harmonious.\nOf him are born tranquil children.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:8)\n\nWater takes the form of any vessel into which it is poured. It is the softest of substances, and has no\ninnate resistance. (Water pressure comes from restraining forms, not from water itself.) Thus it is a\nperfect symbol of harmony\u2013or \u201cagreeableness\u201d as Madhavananda translates it. Ajatasatru points out\nthat we should not exalt finite objects that exemplify worthy characteristics, but Brahman Which IS\nthose traits, the substances and objects only being tiny reflections of Brahman. We must not mistake the\nmirror image for the actual object.\nSelf-effulgent\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018The being who is in the mirror\u2013him I meditate upon as Brahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru\nsaid: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of Brahman. That being I worship as effulgent. He who\nmeditates upon Brahman as such becomes himself effulgent, and his children after. He shines\nbrighter than all who approach him.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:9)\nThe ancient Indians were far more sophisticated than is known in the West. Although I once read such\nan idea denounced as \u201cHindu Fundamentalism\u201d and \u201cMilitant Hinduism,\u201d it is my serious belief that\nIndia has in the past attained levels of technology, medicine, and all aspects of culture that have been\nundreamed of elsewhere on earth. India truly has forgotten more than the modern world can possibly\nknow. This verse is an instance of this.\nWe see our reflection in a mirror because light waves strike the surface of our bodies and clothing, and\nas they are deflected into the mirror we see an image there. But Brahman is swayamprakash, Its own\nillumination. That is why Christian mysticism speaks of Divinity as the \u201cLight of light.\u201d Brahman is the\nsource, the cause, not the effect. \u201cHe shining, everything shines.\u201d (Katha Upanishad 2:2:15)\nLife itself\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018The sound that follows a man as he walks\u2013that I meditate upon as Brahman.\u2019\nAjatasatru said: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of Brahman. That being I worship as the vital\nforce. He who meditates upon Brahman as such reaches his full age in this world: breath does\nnot leave him before his time.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:10)\nBrahman is Life Itself, Existence Itself. All phenomena are simply echoes of Brahman. As just quoted:\n\u201cHe shining, everything shines.\u201d (Katha Upanishad 2:2:15)\n\u201cMy own Self\u201d\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018The being who pervades space\u2013him I meditate upon as Brahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru\nsaid: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of Brahman. That being I worship as a second self, who can\nnever be separated from me. He who meditates upon Brahman as such is never lonely, and his\nfollowers never forsake him.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:11)\nBrahman is not outside us as any \u201cthing.\u201d Rather, Brahman is our own Self. What is most important\nabout this verse is that it indicates the important truth that Brahman is our second Self\u2013not our Atman\nin the simplistic sense. For that would mean that we do not even exist\u2013that as false Advaita says, when\nwe attain realization we will cease to exist and only Brahman will remain. This is not the teaching of\nthe upanishads or the Gita. Brahman is the Self of our Self. First we must come to know our own\nindividual Self, and then proceed to know the Supreme Self, Brahman. Brahman is at the core of our\nSelf, inseparable from It. How this can be is beyond human intelligence, but not beyond our\nexperience, our direct knowing. Buddhi Yoga is the key.\nDivine will\n\n\u201cGargya said: \u2018The being who dwells in the heart as intelligence\u2013him I meditate upon as\nBrahman.\u2019 Ajatasatru said: \u2018Nay, nay! Do not speak thus of Brahman. That being I worship as\nthe lord of will. He who meditates upon Brahman as such achieves self-control, and his children\nafter him.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:13)\nIntelligence or buddhi is centered in the subtle body known as the jnanamaya kosha, which corresponds\nto the air (vayu) element. But the subtlest body is the anandamaya kosha, which corresponds to the\nether (akasha) element. That is the seat of will, the highest power of the individual. The only thing\nhigher is the Self, and since it borders on the Self, the Self (whose Self is Brahman) is \u201cthe lord of\nwill.\u201d We can see this in our daily life. We choose what we will or will not think about. Sometimes we\neven shove thoughts out of our mind, refusing to think on certain subjects or postponing thought till a\nlater time. So the Self is the direct controller of the will. The will determines everything, and even\nunsophisticated philosophy considers free will the prime trait of a human being.\nInsufficient\n\u201cGargya ceased speaking. Ajatasatru, continuing, questioned him. Ajatasatru said: \u2018Is that all\nthat you know of Brahman?\u2019 Gargya said: \u2018That is all that I know.\u2019 Ajatasatru said: \u2018By knowing\nonly so much, one cannot profess to know Brahman.\u2019 Gargya said: \u2018Please, sir, accept me as a\ndisciple, and teach me of Brahman.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:14)\nA practical demonstration\n\u201cAjatasatru said: \u2018I will teach you.\u2019 So saying, Ajatasatru took Gargya by the hand and rose.\nThen, as the two walked side by side, they came to a sleeping man. Ajatasatru said to the\nsleeper: \u2018O thou great one, clad in white raiment, O Soma, O king!\u2019 At first the man did not stir.\nThen, as Ajatasatru touched him, he awoke.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:15)\nOccasionally in the upanishads we find humor used to make a point, and this is one of them. Coming\nacross a sleeping man, Ajatasatru addressed him as the divine Self: \u201cO thou great one, clad in white\nraiment, O Soma, O king!\u201d But it did no good, for the man was unconscious. It was pointless to address\nhim at all. In the same way, all the positive affirming and philosophizing are worthless if the speaker\nand the hearers are spiritually asleep! Sleepers do not need high-sounding words about the Self: they\nneed to awaken. So Ajatasatru shook him until he woke up. We need to be shaken up, to awaken and\nsee with our real eyes and hear with our real ears. Otherwise nothing will really go on. The truth being\nspoken to us means nothing if we are not awake to hear it. Yoga is the great awakener. Other factors\ncan disturb our sleep, get us to open our eyes a bit and then go back to sleep, and just mumble and turn\nover and sleep on. Yoga alone awakens. All the religion and piety mean absolutely nothing if we are not\nawake and clear in the mind. Ajatasatru now analyzes sleep, dream, and dreamless sleep.\nThe sleeper\n\u201cAjatasatru said to Gargya: \u2018This man, who is a conscious, intelligent being\u2013where was he\nwhen he was thus asleep, and how did he thus wake up?\u2019 Gargya was silent.\n\u201cWhen this man, who is a conscious, intelligent being, is thus in deep sleep, he enters into the\nether within the lotus of the heart, having withdrawn into himself both his senses and his mind.\nWhen his senses and his mind are thus withdrawn, he is said to be absorbed in the [lower] self.\n\u201cIn this state he knows nothing; he enters into the seventy-two thousand nerves [nadis] which\ngo out from the lotus of the heart. Even as a young man, or an emperor, or the best of Brahmins,\n\nwhen he has experienced the ecstasy of love, straightway takes sweet repose, so does a man\ndeep in sleep find rest.\n\u201cBut when he sleeps, but also dreams, he lives in a world of his own. He may dream that he is a\nking, or that he is the best of Brahmins; he may dream that he is an angel, or that he is a beast.\nAs an emperor, having obtained the objects of enjoyment, moves about at will in his dominions,\nso the sleeper, gathering up the impressions of sense, compounds them into dreams according to\nhis desires.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:16-19)\nIn sleep we withdraw from the physical senses. In dream we are using the astral senses to create\nwhatever our mind decides. In dreamless sleep we are centered in the causal body. We can even think in\nsuch a state without waking, though it is not common to do so. Yet, as Ajatasatru points out, we are\nalways conscious, witnessing the dream and dreamless states just as we witness the waking state. Even\nmore, when we awaken we often remember the dreams and even say: \u201cI did not dream,\u201d showing that\nwe remember dreamlessness as vividly as we do dreaming and waking. That witnessing conscious is\nour Self, pure being itself.\nThe source\nThe \u201cbottom line\u201d is that the Self is the source of our waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep. It is the\nsource of our entire life, determining every aspect. So Ajatasatru concludes with these words:\n\u201cAs threads come out of the spider, as little sparks come out of the fire, so all the senses, all the\nworlds, all the gods, yea, all beings, issue forth from the Self. His secret name is Truth of the\nTruth.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:1:20)\nThe Self, and ultimately Brahman, is/are the origin and existence of all things. When we know that Self\nwe know, possess, and control all. That and that alone is what it means to be a Master.\n\nThe Dearness of the Self\nNow we come to the best-known dialogue of this upanishad: the conversation between the great sage\nYajnavalkya and Maitreyi his wife. Maitreyi and Gargi (whom we will meet later in this upanishad) are\nevidence that in the time of the ancient sages women were among their number and were teachers of\nBrahman in their own right. True Hindu traditionalists such as the Arya Samajis make no distinction\nbetween male and female in the spiritual rituals (samskaras) received, all wearing the sacred thread\n(yajnopavita) and performing the Vedic rites. The most perfect and powerful fire sacrifice I have ever\nattended was that of the high school girls in the Arya Samaj girls\u2019 school in Baroda. I have never seen\nbetter \u201cbrahmins\u201d than those intelligent and skilled young women. I hope they have retained the\nglorious wisdom they learned at that true gurukula under the direction of the venerable sage Pandit\nAnandapriya of the Arya Samaj.\nThe vital question\n\u201cYajnavalkya said to his wife: \u2018Maitreyi, I am resolved to give up the world and begin the life\nof renunciation. I wish therefore to divide my property between you and my other wife,\nKatyayani.\u2019\n\u201cMaitreyi said: \u2018My lord, if this whole earth belonged to me, with all its wealth, should I\nthrough its possession attain immortality?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018No. Your life would be like that\nof the rich. None can possibly hope to attain immortality through wealth.\u2019\n\n\u201cMaitreyi said: \u2018Then what need have I of wealth? Please, my lord, tell me what you know\nabout the way to immortality.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018Dear to me have you always been, Maitreyi, and now you ask to learn of\nthat truth which is nearest my heart. Come, sit by me. I will explain it to you. Meditate on what\nI say.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:4:1-4)\nWhat a beautiful picture! I cannot count the number of enslaved \u201cspiritual\u201d men who have rhapsodized\nto me about how \u201cspecial\u201d their wives were, that turned out to really be materialistic, anti-spiritual,\nmanipulative harpies. Women have better sense; they rarely extol the duds they are married to\u2013though\nboth sexes are quite willing to use their spouse as justification for neglecting or abandoning spiritual\nlife. After all, they have taken \u201cvows\u201d and taken \u201cobligations\u201d on themselves! God, for another life, has\nto go to the end of the line and wait.\nBut that is not what we see here. We see a real spiritual marriage in action. Both seek Reality. In those\ndays the life of a sannyasi was one of perpetual wandering, so there is no thought of Maitreyi\naccompanying Yajnavalkya in his new stage of life. But we can be assured that her sadhana was no less\nintense than his, for she has been honored for centuries as one of the great illuminati of India, no less\nthan her husband.\nYajnavalkya calls Maitreyi priya, which mean dear, beloved, and pleasing. And he does not mean it in\nthe small-minded egocentric way we are so inured to. And lest she think so, he now begins one of the\nmost quoted passages of the upanishads.\nFor the sake of the Self\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the husband, my beloved, that the husband is dear, but for the sake of\nthe Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the wife, my beloved, that the wife is dear, but for the sake of the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the children, my beloved, that the children are dear, but for the sake of\nthe Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of wealth, my beloved, that wealth is dear, but for the sake of the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the Brahmins, my beloved, that the Brahmins are held in reverence, but\nfor the sake of the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the Kshatriyas, my beloved, that the Kshatriyas are held in honor, but\nfor the sake of the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the higher worlds, my beloved, that the higher worlds are desired, but\nfor the sake of the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the gods, my beloved, that the gods are worshipped, but for the sake of\nthe Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of the creatures, my beloved, that the creatures are prized, but for the sake\nof the Self.\n\u201cIt is not for the sake of itself, my beloved, that anything whatever is esteemed, but for the sake\nof the Self.\n\n\u201cThe Self, Maitreyi, is to be known. Hear about it, reflect upon it, meditate upon it. By knowing\nthe Self, my beloved, through hearing, reflection, and meditation, one comes to know all\nthings.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:4:5)\nThe Self (Atman) is of the nature of bliss (ananda). When the things enumerated above are encountered\na person feels a touch of the joy that is the Self. Actually, our response to them opens the barrier\nbetween us and the Self for a while, and like the light coming through the shutter of a camera we get a\nflash, a glimpse of the bliss of the Self. What we are really valuing is that touch of the Self, but in our\nignorance we think those objects are the source. Therefore it really is because of\u2013\u201cfor the sake of\u201d\u2013the\nSelf that they are thought by us as dear.\nThe wise seek to know the Self through study, deep thought, and meditation upon the Self. And we are\nassured that \u201cby knowing the Self through hearing, reflection, and meditation, one comes to know all\nthings.\u201d\nAll are the Self\nTo know the Self is to know everything. To not know the Self is to know nothing. So the sage\ncontinues:\n\u201cLet the Brahmin ignore him who thinks that the Brahmin is different from the Self.\n\u201cLet the Kshatriya ignore him who thinks that the Kshatriya is different from the Self.\n\u201cLet the higher worlds ignore him who thinks that the higher worlds are different from the Self.\n\u201cLet the gods ignore him who thinks that the gods are different from the Self.\n\u201cLet all creatures ignore him who thinks that the creatures are different from the Self.\n\u201cLet all ignore him who thinks that anything whatever is different from the Self.\n\u201cThe priest, the warrior, the higher worlds, the gods, the creatures, whatsoever things there be\u2013\nthese are the Self.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:4:6)\nThat is certainly clear. And so is this:\n\u201cAs, when the drum is beaten, its various particular notes are not heard apart from the whole,\nbut in the total sound all its notes are heard; as, when the conch shell is blown, its various\nparticular notes are not heard apart from the whole, but in the total sound all its notes are heard;\nas, when the vina is played, its various particular notes are not heard apart from the whole, but\nin the total sound all its notes are heard\u2013so, through the knowledge of the Self, Pure\nIntelligence, all things and beings are known. There is no existence apart from the Self.\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:4:7-9)\nThe incredible spectacle of the endless creations of infinite elaboration springs only from Brahman and\nhas no existence apart from Brahman. The same is true of our own continuing saga of lifetimes: it all\nemanates from the Self. The cosmic and individual dreams arise only from Consciousness. The dreams\nare illusion, yet wisdom (jnana) is inherent in them. So Yajnavalkya further says:\n\u201cAs smoke and sparks arise from a lighted fire kindled with damp fuel, even so, Maitreyi, have\nbeen breathed forth from the Eternal all knowledge and all wisdom\u2013what we know as the Rig\nVeda, the Yajur Veda, and the rest. They are the breath of the Eternal.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka\n\nUpanishad 2:4:10)\nThe all-pervading center\n\u201cAs for water the one center is the ocean, as for touch the one center is the skin, as for smell the\none center is the nose, as for taste the one center is the tongue, as for form the one center is the\neyes, as for sound the one center is the ears, as for thought the one center is the mind, as for\ndivine wisdom the one center is the heart\u2013so for all beings the one center is the Self.\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:4:11)\nIn the twenty-second chapter of Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramhansa Yogananda describes seeing\nwith the \u201ceye\u201d of the Self: \u201cSpiritual sight, x-raylike, penetrates into all matter; the divine eye is center\neverywhere, circumference nowhere. I realized anew, standing there in the sunny courtyard, that when\nman ceases to be a prodigal child of God, engrossed in a physical world indeed dream, baseless as a\nbubble, he reinherits his eternal realms. If \u2018escapism\u2019 be a need of man, cramped in his narrow\npersonality, can any escape compare with the majesty of omnipresence?\u201d\n\u201cAs a lump of salt when thrown into water melts away and the lump cannot be taken out, but\nwherever we taste the water it is salty, even so, O Maitreyi, the individual self, dissolved, is the\nEternal\u2013pure consciousness, infinite and transcendent. Individuality arises by identification of\nthe Self, through ignorance, with the elements; and with the disappearance of consciousness of\nthe many, in divine illumination, it disappears. Where there is consciousness of the Self,\n[seeming] individual separation is no more. This it is, O my beloved, that I wanted to tell you.\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:4:12)\nA doubt\n\u201cMaitreyi said: \u2018\u201cWhere there is consciousness of the Self, individual separation is no more.\u201d\nThis that you say, my lord, confuses me.\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018My beloved, let nothing I have said\nconfuse you. But meditate well the truth that I have spoken.\n\u201c\u2018As long as there is duality, one sees the other, one hears the other, one smells the other, one\nspeaks to the other, one thinks of the other, one knows the other; but when for the illumined\nsoul the all is dissolved in the Self, who is there to be seen by whom, who is there to be smelt\nby whom, who is there to be heard by whom, who is there to be spoken to by whom, who is\nthere to be thought of by whom, who is there to be known by whom? Ah, Maitreyi, my beloved,\nthe Intelligence which reveals all\u2013by what shall it be revealed? By whom shall the Knower be\nknown? The Self is described as Not This, Not That. It is incomprehensible, for it cannot be\ncomprehended; undecaying, for it never decays; unattached, for it never attaches itself;\nunbound, for it is never bound. By whom, O my beloved, shall the Knower be known?\n\u201c\u2018This it is that I teach you, O Maitreyi. This is the truth of immortality.\u2019\n\u201cSo saying, Yajnavalkya entered upon the path of renunciation.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\n2:4:13,14)\nYajnavalkya is not saying that the enlightened go into a kind of non-dual coma in which nothing is\nperceived. Rather, he says that those who have known Brahman, even though they still hear and see\nnames and forms, they know that they are not seeing something \u201cother,\u201d but are seeing only the\nSupreme Self. They do not just believe that, they SEE that to be so. Only the One remains, however\nmany \u201cthings\u201d might be seen in the cosmic dream.\n\nNothing \u201cother\u201d can reveal this Consciousness to us, for that is the Revealer, never the Revealed. For\nthe vision of God takes place within, not without\u2013though afterward we do see Divinity both within and\nwithout. The machine does not run the operator, the operator runs the machine.\nBecause of Its transcendent nature, Brahman is described as Neti Neti\u2013Not This, Not That. We can only\nsay what Brahman is not, and when we come to the end, having negated everything, what remains,\nthough unspeakable and inconceivable, is Brahman.\n\u201cBy whom, O my beloved, shall the Knower be known?\u201d Only to Itself\u2013to our Self.\n\nDivine Sweetness\nWe have had a discourse on how it is the Self that makes all things dear or beloved to us. We often use\nthe expression \u201csweet\u201d to express our pleasure or delight in something, and so the upanishad speaks of\nhow all things are \u201choney\u2019 (madhu) because \u201cBrahman is the soul in each; he indeed is the Self in all.\nHe is all.\u201d The nature of Brahman is bliss (ananda), and Brahman is the soul, the Self of all.\nConsequently all things are joy for the awakened and realized person.\nTo avoid tedium from the type of repetition that is found in many Sanskrit texts (and in many Pali\nsutras of Buddhism), I will just give the first \u201choney\u201d verse and the simply list all of the subjects\ncovered, since except for the keyword each verse is absolutely identical.\n\u201cThis earth is honey for all beings, and all beings are honey for this earth. The intelligent,\nimmortal being, the soul of this earth, and the intelligent, immortal being, the soul in the\nindividual being\u2013each is honey to the other. Brahman is the soul in each; he indeed is the Self in\nall. He is all.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:5:1)\nVerses two to fourteen affirm the joyful nature of water, fire, air, the sun, space, the moon, lightning,\nthunder, ether, dharma, truth (satyam), humanity (manusham), and all things (sarvesham).\nThe upanishad them sums it all up with the following verses:\n\u201cThis Self is the lord of all beings, the king of all beings. As the spokes are held together in the\nhub and in the felly of a wheel, just so all beings, all creatures, all gods, all worlds, all lives, are\nheld together in the Self.\n\u201cHe made bodies with two feet, he made bodies with four feet. He entered into all bodies, and\nbecause he dwells within the lotus of the heart, he is known as Purusha. There is nothing that is\nnot surrounded by him, nothing that is not filled with him.\n\u201cHe assumed all forms. He assumed all forms to reveal himself in all forms. He, the Lord, is\nrevealed in an forms through his Maya. He is tens, he is thousands\u2013he is numberless.\n\u201cThis Brahman is without cause, without effect, without inside or outside. This Brahman is the\nSelf.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2:5:15,18,19)\n\nThe Wisdom of the Wise\nThe next section of the upanishad is a marvel of wisdom that opens with some humor.\nI want those cows!\n\u201cJanaka, King of Videha, on a certain occasion performed a sacrifice and in connection\n\ntherewith distributed costly gifts. Among those who attended the ceremony were the wise men\nof Kuru and of Panchala. King Janaka observed them and wanted to find out which was the\nwisest.\n\u201cNow it happened that the king kept a thousand cows enclosed in a pen, and between the horns\nof every one of them were fastened ten gold coins.\n\u201c\u2018Venerable Brahmins,\u2019 said King Janaka, \u2018let him who is the wisest among you take away\nthese cows.\u2019\n\u201cThe Brahmins dared not stir, save Yajnavalkya alone.\n\u201c\u2018My learned son,\u2019 said Yajnavalkya to his disciple, \u2018drive home my cows.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Hurrah!\u201d cried the lad, and made for them.\n\u201cThe rest of the Brahmins were enraged. \u2018How dare he call himself the wisest!\u2019 they shouted. At\nlast, Aswala, priest to King Janaka, accosted Yajnavalkya, saying:\n\u201c\u2018Yajnavalkya, are you quite sure you are the wisest among us?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018I bow down,\u2019 replied Yajnavalkya, \u2018to the wisest. But I want those cows!\u2019\n\u201cThen Aswala began to question him.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:1:2)\nAs already mentioned, Janaka is considered the prime example of a \u201cworldly\u201d person who attained\nperfect knowledge. He is also considered the prime example of one who possessed great wealth. \u201cRich\nas Janaka\u201d is the Indian equivalent of the West\u2019s \u201crich as Midas.\u201d\nIt was the custom for those who attended spiritual events to be given rich gifts, and it was obvious to all\nthose at the sacrifice that the thousand cows and ten thousand gold coins strung between their horns\nwere meant to be given to the one who could best expound philosophy and answer all challenging\nquestions. (It may be that the ten thousand padas of gold mentioned in the text were not coins of one\npada each, but covers with large gold knobs that were affixed to the cows\u2019 horns.)\nThose who attended the sacrifice were truly wise men, for they were also modest. When told that the\ncows and gold were for the wisest among them \u201cthey dared not stir.\u201d\nYajnavalkya, on the other hand, was tactful. He told a student to take the cows to his home rather than\nclaim he was the wisest, though he was\u2013and knew he was. When challenged by Aswala he said: \u201cI bow\ndown to the wisest, but I want those cows!\u201d In this way he masked his wisdom with humor that\nappeared to be simple greed. Saints often do this, pretending to be ignorant or unaware, hiding their\ntrue status from the truly ignorant and unaware (who, blinded by their ego, are always fooled by the\nruse). Swami Sivananda often did this, as I witnessed myself. Only the wise dare to be thought a fool.\nNow there follows the questioning of Yajnavalkya.\nHow to overcome death\n\u201cAswala said: \u2018Yajnavalkya, since everything connected with sacrificial rites is pervaded by\ndeath, and is subject to death, by what means can the worshiper overcome death?\u2019 Yajnavalkya\nsaid: \u2018By knowledge of the identity between the worshiper, the fire, and the ritual word. For the\nritual word is indeed the worshiper, and the ritual word is the fire, and the fire, which is one\n\nwith Brahman, is the worshiper. This knowledge leads to liberation; this knowledge leads one\nbeyond death.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:1:3)\nAll relative things begin and end, are born and die in a manner of speaking. Everything that is\nconnected with the fire sacrifice is perishable, including the fire itself\u2013all are pervaded by death and\nsubject to death. Obviously, then the sacrifice cannot lead to immortality. So how can we overcome\n(\u201cgo beyond\u201d is the literal wording) death? The answer is simple: by knowing the non-dual Brahman\nWhich alone is immortal and immortality itself.\nWhat \u201ceats\u201d death?\n\u201cAswala held his peace. But Artabhaga asked: \u2018Yajnavalkya, everything is the food of death. Is\nthere any power for which death is food?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018Indeed, yes. Fire devours\neverything, and fire, again, is the food of water. Similarly, there is a death to death. The knower\nof the truth of Brahman overcomes death.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:2:10)\nThose who know Brahman have \u201cdevoured\u201d death just as the eater of food transmutes it into his own\nbody and lives on it. So death itself is the gateway of immortality to the yogi.\nThe liberated at death\n\u201cArtabhaga said: \u2018Yajnavalkya, when such an one gives up his body, do his perceptive faculties,\nalong with his mind, go out of him, or do they not?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018They do not. They\nmerge in the final cause, the Self. The body lies lifeless, inflated, and swollen.\u2019\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:2:11)\nIn relative existence we possess five levels. Artabhaga is asking if all but the physical (material) levels\nor bodies go along with the liberated individual at the departure from the body. Yajnavalkya replies that\nthe pranic (pranamaya) and sensory-mind (manomaya) bodies do not go along with the liberated\nperson, but are resolved back into the universal energy from which they arose when he entered into\nrelativity. We only take with us the buddhi (jnanamaya) and creative will (anandamaya) bodies which\nare causal in nature, the seats of intellect and intuition respectively. For the liberated are free forever of\nthe physical and astral bodies, though they can take new ones on again if they elect to return to\nincarnation in the astral or physical worlds as avatar-saviors in those worlds.\nThe Atman-Self\n\u201cArtabhaga held his peace. Then Ushasta asked: \u2018Yajnavalkya, what is the ultimate, the\nimmediate Brahman, Brahman himself alone, directly realized as such, the Self which dwells\nwithin all?\u2019 Yajnavalkya (pointing to his heart) said: \u2018This, thy Self, which is within all.\u2019\nUshasta said: \u2018Which self, O Yajnavalkya, is within all?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018That which\nbreathes in is thy Self, which is within all. That which breathes down is thy Self, which is\nwithin all. That which diffuses breath is thy Self, which is within all. That which breathes out is\nthy Self, which is within all. Again I reply: This, thy Self, which is within all.\u2019\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:4:1)\nBrahman is the Self within, the Self that enlivens and activates all through the functions of the five\npranas. If we can trace back the pranas, especially through the breath, we will find the Self.\n\u201cUshasta said: \u2018As one might say, in distinguishing a cow from a horse, that the cow is the\nanimal that walks, and the horse is the animal that runs, exactly so simple, so clear, O wise one,\nhas been your teaching about Brahman! But tell me, I ask again, who is the ultimate, the\n\nimmediate Brahman, Brahman himself alone, directly realized as such, the Self which dwells\nwithin all?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018This, thy Self, which is within all.\u2019 Ushasta said: \u2018Which self, O\nYajnavalkya, is within all?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018Thou canst not see the seer of the sight, thou\ncanst not hear the hearer of the sound, thou canst not think the thinker of the thought, thou canst\nnot know the knower of the known. Again I reply: This, thy Self, which is within all. Anything\nthat is not the Self perishes.\u2019 Ushasta held his peace.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:4:2)\nThere is only one Self: the Self that cannot be seen, heard, thought, or known by the limited mind. It,\nbeing inside everything, is not an object of perception. If we take away all \u201cthings\u201d only the Self\nremains, knowing Itself by Itself. Naturally this is not easy to grasp intellectually, because the Self is\nfar beyond the intellect. Nevertheless, these truths can be known by the yogi.\n\u201cKahola asked: \u2018Yajnavalkya, what is the ultimate, the immediate Brahman, Brahman himself\nalone, directly realized as such, the Self which dwells within all?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018This, thy\nSelf, which is within all.\u2019 Kohala said: \u2018Which self, O Yajnavalkya, is within all?\u2019 Yajnavalkya\nsaid: \u2018That which is beyond hunger, thirst, grief, delusion, decay, and death.\n\u201c\u2018Having realized this Self, the sages renounce the craving for progeny, wealth, and existence in\nthe other worlds, and live the life of mendicants.\n\u201c\u2018The craving for progeny leads to the craving for wealth, and the craving for wealth to the\ncraving for existence in the other worlds. Thus there are two cravings\u2013craving for a life of\nenjoyment here, and craving for a life of greater enjoyment hereafter.\n\u201c\u2018Therefore should a sage, when he has fully attained the knowledge of the Self, desire to live\nwith that knowledge as his only refuge. When he has fully attained that knowledge, and realized\nit as his only refuge, he should devote himself exclusively to contemplation of the Self.\n\u201c\u2018He alone is the true knower of Brahman who directs his mind towards the Self and shuns all\nother thoughts as distractions.\n\u201c\u2018How does such a knower of Brahman act and conduct himself? Whatever he may do or\nhowsoever he may conduct himself, he is free from craving, and is forever established in the\nknowledge of Brahman. Anything that is not the Self perishes.\u2019\n\u201cKahola held his peace.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:5:1)\nThose who know the Self turn from the nonsense and ties of the world and lead the life of a bhikshu, a\nmonk. (Although in modern times either \u201csannyasi\u201d or \u201csadhu\u201d is used to designate a monk, in earlier\ncenturies \u201cbhikshu\u201d\u2013one who lives on alms\u2013was also quite common usage.) Those without ties, but\nwith good sense, knowing this, lead that life from the beginning of their quest. Those that learn of the\nSelf after have tied themselves to the world and yet are wise, begin right away moving toward the life\nof renunciation and loosening those ties, anticipating the day when they will walk away into freedom. It\nis not unknown for a realized person to continue living \u201cat home\u201d but in total separation from any\nobligations that it might entail for others, and certainly utterly out of the \u201cgame\u201d of home life. Such a\none was Yogiraj Sri Shyama Charan Lahiri, as a study of his life, especially in Autobiography of a\nYogi, will reveal. However, those who do not live exactly as he did are deluding themselves if they\nthink they are like him.\nThose who are Knowers consider that knowledge their only refuge, the only stable thing in their life,\nand live ever in meditation on the Self.\n\nA lot of ignoramuses and skallawags claim to be enlightened and able to teach others the way of\nenlightenment, but Yajnvaklya tells us: \u201cHe alone is the true knower of Brahman who directs his mind\ntowards the Self and shuns all other thoughts as distractions.\u201d And: \u201cWhatever he may do or howsoever\nhe may conduct himself, he is free from craving, and is forever established in the knowledge of\nBrahman.\u201d It is a pity that unlike Kahola they do not hold their peace.\n\nThe Sutratman, the \u201cThread\u201d Self\nIn the Bhagavad Gita we read: \u201cNothing higher than Me exists. On Me all this universe is strung like\npearls on a thread.\u201d (7:7) This concept is upanishadic:\n\u201cUddalaka spoke: \u2018Yajnavalkya, we lived as students in Madra, in the house of Kapya, whose\nwife was once possessed by a Gandharva, a celestial singer. We asked the Gandharva who he\nwas. He replied that he was Kabandha, and proceeded to question Kapya thus: \u201cDost thou know\nthat thread whereon this life, the next life, and all beings are strung together?\u201d Kapya did not\nknow. The Gandharva continued: \u201cDost thou know that Inner Ruler who controls, from within,\nthis life, the next life, and all beings?\u201d Kapya did not know. The Gandharva then said: \u201cHe who\nknows that thread and that Inner Ruler knows Brahman, knows the worlds, knows the gods,\nknows the Vedas, knows the creatures, knows the Self\u2013knows all things.\u201d I myself know these\nthings that the Gandharva taught. Yajnavalkya, if thou, without knowing that thread and that\nInner Ruler, take the cows that belong only to the wisest, accursed shalt thou be.\u2019 Yajnavalkya\nsaid: \u2018I know that thread and that Inner Ruler.\u2019 Uddalaka said: \u2018Anybody can say, \u201cI know, I\nknow.\u201d Tell us what you know.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:7:1)\nThis questioning contains a lot of facts regarding the Self:\nIt is the connecting foundation of all beings.\nIt is the cohesive force that impels all beings through a succession of lives for their evolution.\nIt is the absolute Ruler and Controller of all lives and beings as their inmost essential nature.\nTo know the Self is to know all things, both the Manifester and the manifested.\nNow Yajnavalkya responds.\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The subtle principle of life is that thread whereon this life and the next life\nand all beings are strung. Hence, when a man dies, they say his limbs are loosed, for while he\nlives they are held together by that principle of life.\u2019 Uddalaka said: \u2018That is true, Yajnavalkya.\nNow speak of the Inner Ruler.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:7:2)\nThe Self is the principle of Life itself.\nPresent but separate\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018He who dwells on earth, but is separate from the earth, whom the earth\ndoes not know, whose body the earth is, and who controls the earth from within\u2013he, the Self, is\nthe Inner Ruler, the Immortal.\n\u201c\u2018He who dwells in water but is separate from water, whom water does not know, whose body\nwater is, and who controls water from within\u2013he, the Self, is the Inner Ruler, the Immortal.\n\u201c\u2018He who dwells in fire but is separate from fire, whom fire does not know, whose body fire is,\n\nand who controls fire from within\u2013he, the Self, is the Inner Ruler, the Immortal.\n\u201c\u201cHe who dwells in the sky, in the air, in heaven, in the four quarters, in the sun, in the moon, in\nthe stars, in ether, in darkness, in light, but is separate from them, whom none of them knows,\nwhose body they are, and who controls them from within\u2013he, the Self, is the Inner Ruler, the\nImmortal.\n\u201c\u2018He who dwells in all beings but is separate from all beings, whom no being knows, whose\nbody all beings are, and who controls all beings from within\u2013he, the Self, is the inner Ruler, the\nImmortal.\n\u201c\u2018He who dwells in odor, speech, sight, hearing, and touch, but is separate from them, whom\nodor, speech, sight, hearing, and touch do not know, whose body is odor, speech, sight, hearing,\nand touch are, and who controls them all from within\u2013he, the Self, is the Inner Ruler, the\nImmortal.\n\u201c\u2018He who dwells in the mind, but is separate from the mind, whom the mind does not know,\nwhose body the mind is, and who controls the mind from within\u2013he, the Self, is the Inner Ruler,\nthe Immortal.\n\u201c\u2018He who dwells in the intellect, but is separate from the intellect, whom the intellect does not\nknow, whose body the intellect is, and who controls the intellect from within\u2013he, the Self, is the\nInner Ruler, the Immortal.\n\u201c\u2018Unseen, but the seer; unheard but the hearer, unthinkable, but the thinker; unknown, but the\nknower\u2013there is no seer but he, there is no hearer but he, there is no other but he, there is no\nknower but he. He, the Self, is the Inner Ruler, the Immortal.\n\u201c\u2018Anything that is not the Self perishes.\u2019\n\u201cUddalaka held his peace.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:7:3-23)\nIf we have not figured this out already, nothing can be said that will give us the idea. But we do have\nthe idea, and this is an affirmation intended to confirm us in our understanding.\nGargi and the Imperishable\nNow we hear from the female sage, Gargi.\n\u201cThen arose Gargi, the daughter of Vachaknu, and addressed the sages: \u2018Revered Brahmins, I\nshall ask Yajnavalkya two questions. If he is able to answer them, no one among you can ever\ndefeat him. He will be the great expounder of the truth of Brahman.\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018Ask, O\nGargi.\u2019\n\u201cGargi said: \u2018Yajnavalkya, as the son of a warrior from Kashi or Videha might string his\nloosened bow and with two deadly arrows in his hand rise to give battle, even so have I risen to\nfight thee with two questions.\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018Ask, O Gargi.\u2019\n\u201cGargi said: \u2018Yajnavalkya, that of which they say that it is above heaven and below the earth,\nwhich is between heaven and earth as well, and which was, is, and shall be\u2013tell me, in what is it\nwoven, warp and woof?\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018That of which they say, O Gargi, that it is above heaven and below the\n\nearth, which is between heaven and earth as well, and which was, is, and shall be\u2013that is woven,\nwarp and woof, in the ether.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:8:1-4)\nEther (Akasha) is the subtlest element, so subtle that it is often indistinguishable from\nConsciousness. Without it nothing can exist. Yet there is more, so Gargi persists.\n\u201cGargi said: \u2018Thou hast answered my first question. I bow to thee, O Yajnavalkya. Be ready\nnow to answer my second question.\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018Ask, O Gargi.\u2019\n\u201cGargi said: \u2018In whom is that ether woven, warp and woof?\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The seers, O Gargi, call him Akshara\u2013the changeless Reality. He is neither\ngross nor fine, neither short nor long, neither hot nor cold, neither light nor dark, neither of the\nnature of air, nor of the nature of ether. He is without relations. He is without taste or smell,\nwithout eyes, ears, speech, mind, vigor, breath, mouth; he is without measure; he is without\ninside or outside. He enjoys nothing; nothing enjoys him.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:8:58)\n\u201cAkshara\u201d means imperishable, indestructible, and immutable. It is sometimes a synonym for\nthe Chidakasha, the Ether of Consciousness in which the element of ether rests. As Yajnavalkya\nmakes clear, the Imperishable Brahman and the imperishable Self are No Thing, having not\nattributes or form whatsoever; yet It is infinite and omnipresent. \u201cHe enjoys nothing\u201d because\nthere is no second, no separate object for Brahman to be involved with or relate to. And\n\u201cnothing enjoys him\u201d because no thing can perceive Brahman. \u201cThings\u201d do not really exist.\nBrahman, on the other hand, is the sole Existence.\n\u201c\u2018At the command of that Akshara, O Gargi, sun and moon hold their courses. At the command\nof that Akshara, O Gargi, heaven and earth keep their positions. At the command of that\nAkshara, O Gargi, moments, hours, days and nights, fortnights and months, seasons and years\u2013\nall follow their paths. At the command of that Akshara, O Gargi, rivers, issuing from the snowy\nmountains, flow on, some eastward, some westward, others in other directions.\n\u201c\u2018He, O Gargi, who in this world, without knowing this Akshara, offers oblations, performs\nsacrifices, practices austerities, even though for many thousands of years, gains little: his\nofferings and practices are perishable. He, O Gargi, who departs this life without knowing the\nImperishable, is pitiable. But he, O Gargi, who departs this life knowing the Akshara, is wise.\n\u201c\u2018This Akshara, O Gargi, is unseen but is the seer, is unheard but is the hearer, is unthinkable\nbut is the thinker, is unknown but is the knower. There is no seer but he, there is no hearer but\nhe, there is no thinker but he, there is no knower but he. In Akshara, verily, O Gargi, the ether is\nwoven, warp and woof.\u2019\n\u201cGargi said: \u2018Revered Brahmins, well may you feel blest if you get off with bowing before him!\nNo one will defeat Yajnavalkya, expounder of the truth of Brahman.\u2019 Gargi held her peace.\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:8:9-12)\nIs it any wonder that men and women throughout the ages have devoted their entire lives to the pursuit\nof the knowledge of Brahman? What else is there?\n\u201cYajnavalkya addressed the sages: \u2018Revered Brahmins, ask me questions if you will\u2013any one of\nyou in the assembly, or all of you. Or if any one of you so desires, I will question him. Or I will\nquestion all of you.\u2019 But the Brahmins held their peace.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3:9:27)\n\nLet us hope they returned home and doubled and tripled their efforts to realize Brahman. And so may\nwe, for that is the purpose of this section.\n\nJanaka and Yajnavalkya\u20131\nWe come now to the lengthiest dialogue in any of the upanishads. Swami Prabhavananda ended his\ntranslation of the upanishad at its conclusion, evidently feeling that anything following it would be of\nvastly inferior value.\nWealth or knowledge?\n\u201cOn a certain occasion, Janaka, king of Videha, having seated himself to give audience, saw the\nsage Yajnavalkya among his visitors and accosted him. Janaka said: \u2018Yajnavalkya, what brings\nyou here? Do you come for cattle, or for philosophy?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018For both, Your\nMajesty.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:1:1)\nThe great sages, whether past or present, always have a sense of humor. And they are not interested in\nhow they \u201clook\u201d to others. I have seen both of these principles more than once in Swami Sivananda and\nother great yogis in India.\nHumorous though it be, this verse has a real message: the intelligent yogi is interested in the total\npicture, both material and spiritual. It is ignorance that postulates an incompatibility between material\nand spiritual life. It is ignorance that creates the problem, not matter or spirit. After all, matter is a\nmanifestation of spirit. Both Janaka and Yajnavalkya were rich in material possessions and in wisdom.\nIn America we have had two men that were equally successful in finance and spirituality: J. C. Penney,\nfounder of \u201cPenney\u2019s\u201d department store chain and James J. Lynn, whose many-branched multimillion\ndollar empire could not keep him from becoming one of this country\u2019s greatest yogis and the successor\nof Paramhansa Yogananda as president of Self-Realization Fellowship. In India I met men of fabulous\nwealth whose whole mind and heart were centered in spirit-consciousness while working tirelessly for\nthe welfare of the people.\nAs Sri Ramakrishna said: \u201cIf you can weigh salt, you can weigh sugar.\u201d\nWord-Brahman\n\u201c[Yajnavalkya said:] \u2018I wish to hear what your teachers may have taught you.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Jitwa taught me that the word [vak] is Brahman.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018As one who in childhood was instructed adequately, first by his mother and\nthen by his father, and after that was initiated into the sacred mysteries by a sage\u2013as such an one\nshould teach, so has Jitwa taught you the truth when he said that the word is Brahman. For what\ncould a person achieve without the word? But did he tell you about the abode and support of\nthis Word-Brahman?\u2018\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018No, he did not.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018Then you have been only partly taught.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Do you, then, teach me, O Yajnavalkya.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The organ of speech is its abode, and ether, the primal cause of the\n\nuniverse, is its eternal support. Meditate upon the word as identical with knowledge.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018What is knowledge, Yajnavalkya?\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The word is knowledge, Your Majesty. For through the word a friend is\nknown, and likewise all knowledge, spiritual or otherwise. Through the word is gained\nknowledge of this world and of the next. Through the word is obtained knowledge of all\ncreatures. The word, Your Majesty, is the Supreme Brahman.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018I give you a thousand cows with a bull as big as an elephant for teaching me.\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018My father was of the opinion that one should not accept any reward from a\ndisciple without fully instructing him.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:1:2)\nThe power of Word, both conceptualization and verbal expression of concepts, is the distinctive feature\nof the human being, although many other species on earth use sound for communication. There is great\npower is speech for many reasons, some intellectual and some esoteric. Yajnavalkya points out that it is\nnot enough to appreciate the power of word, but we must know that which gives word it power, what is\nits \u201cabode and support.\u201d He then tells us that it is the faculty of speech, the innate capacity of the\nhuman being for speech, that is the abode of word, for without the faculty of speech there could be no\nword expressed. Yet that is not the ultimate basis of the word. \u201cEther, the primal cause of the universe,\nis its eternal support.\u201d Here, again, the Chidakasha is meant. Sound arises out of the element of ether,\nand the consciousness behind intelligent sound is the Chidakasha, the Self of the nature of\nConsciousness. So it is this Consciousness that is the origin of the Word-Brahman, the Shabda\nBrahman, whose primary form is Om. That Word is to be meditated upon as Prajna (\u201cknowledge\u201d), the\ninmost consciousness.\n\u201cMy father was of the opinion that one should not accept any reward from a disciple without fully\ninstructing him.\u201d This tells us two things: Yajnavalkya possessed a spiritual lineage, a tradition with\nroots. Also he considered that partial knowledge was of little value.\nBreath-Brahman\n\u201c[Yajnavalkya said:] \u2018I wish to know what anyone else may have taught you.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Udanka taught me that breath [prana] is Brahman. He did not tell me about its\nabode and support.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018Prana is its abode and ether [akasha] its support. It should be meditated\nupon as dear. For life is indeed dear. The primal energy is Brahman.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka\nUpanishad 4:1:3)\nWhen we breathe we live, and when we stop breathing, we die. That is why breath holds such a\nprincipal place in the practice of yoga. However, the breath is just the objectified physical\nmanifestation of the inner movement of prana, the primal life energy within the human being. Prana is\nthe force of life itself, but it, like the faculty of speech, has the Chidakasa as its origin and support. The\nprana is indeed dear, for it is the coin of life.\nSight-Brahman\nNow we have another of the same-word passages:\n\u201c[Yajnavalkya said:] \u2018Tell me what more you have been taught.\u2019\n\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Barku taught me that the eye [chakshu] is Brahman. But he did not teach me its\nabode and support.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018Sight [chakshu] is its abode and ether its support. It should be meditated\nupon as truth. For it is by sight that objects are known. Sight is Brahman. What more have you\nlearned?\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:1:4)\nThe word chakshu means both the physical eye and the faculty of sight. The eye is meaningless if one\nlacks the faculty of sight. And that, too, is rooted in the Chidakasha. Thus we see that all our faculties\nare but rays of the sun that is the Chidakasha.\nThe next few verses are going to follow this pattern: the teachers of Janaka will have named the\nmaterial sense organ, and Yajnavalkya will explain that it is the faculty\u2013and ultimately the Chidakasha\u2013\nthat is the attribute/power of Brahman.\nHearing-Brahman\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Gardabhivipati taught me that the ear [shrotra] is Brahman.\u2019 Yajnavalkya said:\n\u2018Hearing [shrotra] is its abode and ether its support. It should be meditated upon as limitless.\nFor sound is carried by space, and space is limitless. Hearing is Brahman.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka\nUpanishad 4:1:5)\nThere is a yogic aspect to this, since sound in the form of subtle inner hearing is the quintessential\nelement of meditation practice. This faculty is rooted in the ether element which is all-pervading and\nlimitless. Thus through working with sound in meditation we can access the all-pervading and limitless\nConsciousness that is Brahman.\nMind-Brahman\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Satyakama taught me that the mind [manas] is Brahman.\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018The\nmind [manas] is its abode and ether its support. It should be meditated upon as happiness. For\nby the mind alone is happiness experienced. Mind is Brahman.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\n4:1:6)\nHere the lower, sensory mind is being spoken of whose basis is the higher mind, the intellect (buddhi).\nThe important principle is the fact that happiness is only in the intelligent mind.\nHeart-Brahman\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Vidagdha taught me that the heart [hridaya] is Brahman.\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018The\nheart [hridaya] is its abode and ether its support. It should be meditated upon as the restingplace. For all beings find rest in the heart. The heart is Brahman.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\n4:1:7)\nThe \u201cheart\u201d is the faculty of consciousness in the human being, and that rests within the greater\nConsciousness of Brahman.\nFurther teaching\n\u201cJanaka (descending from his throne and humbly addressing the sage) said: \u2018I bow down to you.\nYajnavalkya, please teach me.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018Your Majesty, as a person wishing to make a long journey furnishes himself\n\nwith a chariot or a boat, so have you equipped your mind with sacred wisdom. You are\nhonorable and wealthy, and you have studied the Vedas and learned the Upanishads. Whither\nthen shall you go when you leave this body?\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018I do not know, revered sir.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018I will tell you where you will go.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Tell me, please.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018Indha is the Self identified with the physical self. Viraj, the physical world\nis his wife, the object of his enjoyment. The space within the heart is their place of union in\ndream, when the Self is identified with the subtle body, or mind. The Self in dreamless sleep is\nidentified with the vital force. Beyond this is the Supreme Self\u2013he that has been described as\nNot This, Not That. He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be comprehended; he is undecaying,\nfor he never decays; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself; he is unfettered, for\nnothing can fetter him. He is never hurt. You have attained him who is free from fear, O Janaka,\nand free from birth and death.\u2019\nJanaka said: \u2018May that fearlessness come to you who teach us fearlessness. I bow down to you.\nBehold, this empire of Videha, and I myself, are at your service.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\n4:2:1-4)\nIn reality, the liberated person does not \u201cgo\u201d anywhere, but abides as the Self. Wherefore let us strive to\nknow the Self and transcend all \u201ccoming\u201d and \u201cgoing.\u201d\n\nJanaka and Yajnavalkya\u20132\nIn this next conversation of Yajnavalkya and Janaka, the first seven verses are a complete unit, so to\nspeak.\nThe light of human beings\n\u201cOnce when Yajnavalkya came to the court of King Janaka, the King welcomed him with a\nquestion.\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Yajnavalkya, what serves as the light for man?\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The light of the sun, Your Majesty; for by the light of the sun man sits, goes\nout, does his work, and returns home.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018True indeed, Yajnavalkya.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018But when the sun has set, what serves then as his light?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018The moon is then\nhis light.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018When the sun has set, O Yajnavalkya, and the moon has set, what serves then as\nhis light?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018The fire is then his light.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018When the sun has set, O Yajnavalkya, and the moon has set, and the fire has gone\nout, what serves then as his light?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018Sound is then his light; for with sound\nalone as his light, man sits, goes out, does his work, and returns home. Even though he cannot\nsee his own hand, yet when he hears a sound he moves towards it.\u2019 Janaka said: \u2018True indeed, O\n\nYajnavalkya.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018When the sun has set, and the moon has set, and the fire has gone out, and no sound is heard,\nwhat serves then as his light?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018The Self indeed is his light; for by the light of\nthe Self man sits, moves about, does his work, and when his work is done, rests.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Who is that Self?\u2019 Yajnavalkya said: \u2018The self-luminous being who dwells within\nthe lotus of the heart, surrounded by the senses and sense organs, and who is the light of the\nintellect, is that Self. Becoming identified with the intellect, he moves to and fro, through birth\nand death, between this world and the next. Becoming identified with the intellect, the Self\nappears to be thinking, appears to be moving. While the mind is dreaming, the Self also appears\nto be dreaming, and to be beyond the next world as well as this.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\n4:3:1-7)\nThis is all quite clear, but it is good note that it is identity with the intellect, the intelligence principle in\nour makeup that both enables and causes us to move between this world and another, for we think that\nwe are engaging in the functions of the intellect, not realizing that it is but an instrument formed of the\nthree gunas and is not us at all. So we say: \u201cI slept; I woke up; I was dreaming,\u201d and so forth. Another\nimportant point is implied here. Notice that Yajnavalkya does not speak of identifying with the body,\nsenses, emotions, etc. This is because the upanishad is intended for the instruction of those who have\nevolved beyond that type of identity, whose center of awareness in in the intellect, in the highest level\nof their being. Is this \u201celitist\u201d? Absolutely! As Jesus said, \u201cGive not that which is holy unto the dogs,\nneither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and\nrend you.\u201d (Matthew 7:6)\nA third point is that the Self is not \u201cbeyond the next world as well as this.\u201d That is, It is not subject to\ncoming and going, is neither within nor without any world. It transcends those kinds of designation.\nThe real \u201croot of all evil\u201d\n\u201c\u2018When man, the individual soul, is born, and assumes relationship with the body and sense\norgans, he becomes associated with the evils of the world. When at death he gives up the body,\nhe leaves all evils behind.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:3:8)\nYajnavalkya does not say that false identity is the problem, rather that mere birth in a body creates\nunavoidable association with all the troubles and risks that every embodied being endures. We see this\nin the life of great avatars and masters: their lives were filled with troubles, and many of them died\nquite painfully. Why anyone would pray to them to remove troubles and disease is beyond\ncomprehension. Why do the good suffer? Because they are in a body. This is a basic fact of life. That is\nwhy spiritually intelligent people understand that the real sacrifice made by masters of all ages was\ntheir incarnation\u2013and everything went on from there. To endure the limitations and dangers of finite\nexistence is a great, even a terrible, sacrifice they undergo at every moment. Being masters inwardly as\nwell as outwardly, the sacrifice never overwhelms them, and they realized the implications of birth\nbefore they were even conceived. Since they are always in charge, they do not experience the mental\nanguish we do, but they go through the entire range of earthly miseries just like anyone else. With them\neverything is voluntary, for they have no karma to drag them into birth and through all that happens\nafterward. They walk through life, while we are pushed and pulled along. But for both them and us, to\nescape the body is to escape it all. And Atmajnana is the only true escape.\nThe human status\n\n\u201c\u2018There are two states for man\u2013the state in this world, and the state in the next; there is also a\nthird state, the state intermediate between these two, which can be likened to dream. While in\nthe intermediate state, a man experiences both the other states, that in this world and that in the\nnext; and the manner thereof is as follows: When he dies, he lives only in the subtle body, on\nwhich are left the impressions of his past deeds, and of these impressions he is aware, illumined\nas they are by the pure light of the Self. Thus it is that in the intermediate state he experiences\nthe first state, or that of life in the world. Again, while in the intermediate state, he foresees both\nthe evils and the blessings that will yet come to him, as these are determined by his conduct,\ngood and bad, upon the earth, and by the character in which this conduct has resulted. Thus it is\nthat in the intermediate state he experiences the second state, or that of life in the world to\ncome.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:3:9)\nWe are either embodied in this world, or disembodied and living in the astral realm. But between the\ntwo is the dream state in which we experience both material and astral conditions. For example, we fall\noff a cliff and experience falling just as we would in the waking state. But when we hit the ground we\ndo not die\u2013it does not even hurt. That is how it is in the astral world. And that is why little children are\nso fearless and will go right into a life-threatening situation without hesitation\u2013in the astral world it is\nnot threatening at all. It may even be fun. One of Yogananda\u2019s monastic disciples once explained to a\ngroup of people that they should not be impatient with the intense reactions of children to pain and\nfrustration. For in the astral world they get anything they want just by wanting, and they can go\nanywhere and do anything without pain. So when the situation is different in this world they are\nterrified and angry. They are also miserable in realizing that they are now in a world in which\nuncertainty is the only certainty. A friend of mine was once found by her father sitting in the midst of\nthe floor crying bitterly. (She was two years old at the time.) When he asked her what was wrong, she\ncomplained that she could not fly. Luckily, he was a metaphysician, so he explained to her that\nalthough she could fly in the world she had come from, in this world people could not fly. \u201cThen it\u2019s a\ndumb world!\u201d she said. \u201cI agree. So do your best not to come back,\u201d was his counsel.\nWhen we leave our bodies we gain a great deal of understanding. We comprehend the life that has just\nended and realize its deeper meanings. We analyze it, actually, and learn from it. Sometimes we have\nhelpers in doing this. So even though we underwent things on earth with complete non-comprehension,\nnow then see clearly their roots and their purpose. Those who do not know this often ask what good it\nis for infants and children to reap negative karmas and die young, for they cannot understand. Indeed,\nin this world they cannot understand, but the moment they are freed from the body they can and do\nunderstand. Also, it was their karma to suffer uncomprehendingly. It all works out to perfection,\nhowever it seems at the present moment. A religion that does not teach these facts to its adherents is\nunworthy of anyone\u2019s attention. And a religion that tells people that God wills it all\u2013is doing it to them\nbecause He has \u201ca plan\u201d\u2013is a barefaced liar that deserves only contempt. But of course, many people\ndeserve a contemptible religion. That, too, is karma.\nDream\n\u201c\u2018In the intermediate state, there are no real chariots, nor horses, nor roads; but by the light of\nthe Self he creates chariots and horses and roads. There are no real blessings, nor joys, nor\npleasures; but he creates blessings and joys and pleasures. There are no real ponds, nor lakes,\nnor rivers; but he creates ponds and lakes and rivers. He is the creator of all these out of the\nimpressions left by his past deeds.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:3:10)\nJust see what an incredible power of creative intelligence we all have! Also, even dreams are a matter\nof karma. Paramhansa Yogananda said that we can work out karma in the dream state.\n\n\u201c\u2018Regarding the different states of consciousness, it is written: While one is in the state of\ndream, the golden, self-luminous being, the Self within, makes the body to sleep, though he\nhimself remains forever awake and watches by his own light the impressions of deeds that have\nbeen left upon the mind. Thereafter, associating himself again with the consciousness of the\norgans of sense, the Self causes the body to awake.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:3:11)\nIn all states we are the self-luminous, untouched Witness. And all states are under our control.\n\u201c\u2018While one is in the state of dream, the golden, self-luminous being, the Self within, the\nImmortal One, keeps alive the house of flesh with the help of the vital force, but at the same\ntime walks out of this house. The Eternal goes wherever he desires.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka\nUpanishad 4:3:12)\nHere is clear teaching that in dream we sometimes leave the body and travel in either this world or the\nnext. In that state:\n\u201c\u2018The self-luminous being assumes manifold forms, high and low, in the world of dreams. He\nseems to be enjoying the pleasure of love, or to be laughing with friends, or to be looking at\nterrifying spectacles.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:3:13)\nThis experience is common to all, from the least intelligent to the genius. Yet: \u201c\u2018Everyone is aware of\nthe experiences; no one sees the Experiencer.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:3:14) That is the riddle\nwe must all solve.\n\u201c\u2018Some say that dreaming is but another form of waking, for what a man experiences while\nawake he experiences again in his dreams. Be that as it may, the Self, in dreams, shines by his\nown light.\u2019 Janaka said: \u2018Revered sir, I offer you a thousand cattle. Instruct me further for the\nsake of my liberation.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:3:15)\nFree while bound\nEven a tethered animal can move about as much as it likes within the bounds of the tether. It is the\nsame with us. So we are never absolutely bound, but always experience a great deal of freedom, even if\nit is mostly psychological. A lot of what follows is obvious and even common knowledge, so no\ncomment is needed.\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The Self, having in dreams tasted enjoyment, gone hither and thither,\nexperienced both good and evil, attains to the state of dreamless sleep; then again he comes\nback to dreams. \u2018Whatever he may experience in dreams does not affect him, for the true nature\nof the Self remains forever unaffected.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018So it is indeed, Yajnavalkya. I offer you another thousand cattle, revered sir.\nSpeak on for the sake of my liberation.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The Self, having in dreams tasted enjoyment, gone hither and thither,\nexperienced good and evil hastens back to the state of waking from which he started. Whatever\nhe may experience in dreams does not affect him, for the true nature of the Self remains forever\nunaffected.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018So it is indeed, Yajnavalkya. Another thousand cattle shall be yours, revered sir.\nSpeak on for the sake of my liberation.\u2019\n\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The Self, having in wakefulness enjoyed the pleasures of sense, gone hither\nand thither, experienced good and evil, hastens back again to his dreams.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018As a large fish moves from one bank of a river to the other, so does the Self move between\ndreaming and waking.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018As a hawk or a falcon flying in the sky becomes tired, and stretching its wings comes back to\nits nest, so does the Self hasten to that state where, deep in sleep, he desires no more desires,\nand dreams no more dreams.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:3:16-19)\nThe transcendent Self\nThere now follows one of the most thrilling and exalted passage of the upanishads.\n\u201c\u2018Indeed, the Self, in his true nature, is free from craving, free from evil, free from fear. As a\nman in the embrace of his loving wife knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within, so\nman in union with the Self knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within, for in that state\nall desires are satisfied. The Self is his only desire; he is free from craving, he goes beyond\nsorrow.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Then father is no father, mother is no mother; worlds disappear, gods disappear, scriptures\ndisappear; the thief is no more, the murderer is no more, castes are no more; no more is there\nmonk or hermit. The Self is then untouched either by good or by evil, and the sorrows of the\nheart are turned into joy.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018He does not see, nor smell, nor taste, nor speak, nor hear, nor think, nor touch, nor know; for\nthere is nothing separate from him, there is no second. Yet he can see, for sight and he are one;\nyet he can smell, for smelling and he are one; yet he can taste, for taste and he are one; yet he\ncan speak, for speech and he are one; yet he can hear, for hearing and he are one; yet he can\nthink, for thinking and he are one; yet he can touch, for touching and he are one; yet he can\nknow, for knowing and he are one. Eternal is the light of consciousness; immortal is the Self.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018When there is another, then one sees another, smells another, tastes another, speaks to another,\nhears another, thinks of another, touches and knows another.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Pure like crystal water is that Self, the only seer, the One without a second. He is the kingdom\nof Brahman\u2013man\u2019s highest goal, supreme treasure, greatest bliss. Creatures who live within the\nbonds of ignorance experience but a small portion of his infinite being.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka\nUpanishad 4:3:21-32)\nFor some reason Swami Prabhavananda omitted the next verse, perhaps because it had already\nappeared in the Taittiriya Upanishad in his translation. Here is Swami Madhavananda\u2019s translation:\n\u201c\u2018He who is perfect of physique and prosperous among men, the ruler of others, and most\nlavishly supplied with all human enjoyments, represents greatest joy among men. This human\njoy multiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy for the manes who have won that world of\ntheirs. The joy of these manes who have won that world multiplied a hundred times makes one\nunit joy in the world of the celestial minstrels. This joy in the world of the celestial minstrels\nmultiplied a hundred times makes one unit of joy for the gods by action\u2013those who have\nattained their godhead by their actions. This joy of the gods by action multiplied a hundred\ntimes makes one unit of joy for the gods by birth, as also of one who is versed in the Vedas,\nsinless and free from desire. This joy of the gods by birth multiplied a hundred times makes one\n\nunit of joy in the world of Prajapati (Viraj), as well as one who is versed in the Vedas, sinless\nand free from desire. This joy in the world of Prajapati multiplied a hundred times makes one\nunit of joy in the world of Brahman (Hiranyagarbha), as well as of one who is versed in the\nVedas, sinless and free from desire. This indeed is the supreme bliss. This is the state of\nBrahman, O Emperor,\u2019 said Yajnavalkya.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:3:33)\nKNOW THE SELF!\n\nThe Process of Reincarnation\nThe following verses alone in all the upanishads describe to some degree the process of reincarnation.\nDreaming and waking\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018You shall have still another thousand cattle. Speak on, revered sir, for the sake of\nmy liberation.\u2019\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The Self, having in dreams enjoyed the pleasures of sense, gone hither and\nthither, experienced good and evil, hastens back to the state of waking from which he started.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018As a man passes from dream to wakefulness, so does he pass at death from this life to the\nnext. When a man is about to die, the subtle body, mounted by the intelligent Self, groans\u2013as a\nheavily laden cart groans under its burden.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018When his body becomes thin through old age or disease, the dying man separates himself\nfrom his limbs, even as a mango or a fig or a banyan fruit separates itself from its stalk, and by\nthe same way that he came he hastens to his new abode, and there assumes another body, in\nwhich to begin a new life.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:3:33-36)\nPassing from life to life is only a shifting in a dream. When the stored-up life force (a form of karma)\nfor a life is running out, just as the charge in a battery is expended and fails, so do the physical and\ngrosser pranic bodies. And, just as the ripe fruit falls from the tree, so the subtle body separates itself\nfrom the material body and begins its process toward another earthly birth in a new body. In between\nbirths, the individual spends time in the astral regions, sometimes just wandering and frittering his time\naway, and sometimes in learning and evolving so his next life will be markedly better\u2013and wiser\u2013than\nthe previous one. This time spent in this intermediate state can be anything from a matter of hours to\ncenturies and even thousands of years. This is precisely determined by karma.\n(By the way, it is nonsense to say that unevolved people reincarnate quickly and evolved people only\ncome back in thousands of years. Both ends of the spectrum are similar: very unevolved beings\nreincarnate very fast, and so do those that are highly evolved, for they are getting ready to graduate and\nare \u201ccramming\u201d for the final test.)\nLeaving the body\n\u201c\u2018When his body grows weak and he becomes apparently unconscious, the dying man gathers\nhis senses about him and completely withdrawing their powers descends into his heart. No more\ndoes he see form or color without.\n\u201c\u2018He neither sees, nor smells, nor tastes. He does not speak, he does not hear. He does not think,\nhe does not know. For all the organs, detaching themselves from his physical body, unite with\nhis subtle body. Then the point of his heart, where the nerves join, is lighted by the light of the\n\nSelf, and by that light he departs either through the eye, or through the gate of the skull, or\nthrough some other aperture of the body. When he thus departs, life departs; and when life\ndeparts, all the functions of the vital principle depart. The Self remains conscious, and,\nconscious, the dying man goes to his abode. The deeds of this life, and the impressions they\nleave behind, follow him.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:1,2)\nHe becomes apparently unconscious. This is important. The person may cease to perceive anything, but\nthat is not being unconscious. We are never unconscious at any time, but we mistakenly call total\nabsence of sensory perception unconsciousness. There is a vital point I want to mention here. The very\nlast sense to fail is the sense of hearing. Sometimes it never fails. A lot of people give up and die\nbecause they hear the doctor say there is no hope or that they will soon be dead. So if you are around a\ndying, \u201cunconscious\u201d person please remember this. You can speak to them and help them either revive\nor go to higher worlds. That is why both Hindus and Buddhists read scriptures to the dying or recite\nmantras or sing mantras. In Pure Land Buddhism people sit by the dying and sing the mantra of Amida\nBuddha, continuing to do so for several hours after the person appears to be dead, knowing that\nsometimes they may have trouble getting out of the body or may be disoriented when they do.\nYogananda spoke of this to his students, one of whom was the famous opera singer Amelita GalliCurci. So when her brother was dying she talked to him and called him back to life. When he became\n\u201cconscious\u201d he told her that he had heard doctor saying he would soon be dead, so he accepted it and\nbegan drifting away. Then he heard her voice calling to him from far off, and telling him to return. So\nhe did! At one point he even saw Yogananda, about whom he knew virtually nothing but he recognized\nYogananda when his sister showed a picture to him.\nIt is sometimes possible to revive a person by intoning Om in their right ear. Yogananda also\nrecommended this.\nThen the point of his heart, where the nerves join, is lighted by the light of the Self, and by that light he\ndeparts either through the eye, or through the gate of the skull, or through some other aperture of the\nbody. This is the Light that so many people tell about seeing who have returned from near-death. There\nare many gates by which a person may leave the body, and they are all determined by the level of\nconsciousness (bhava) in which he has habitually lived during his lifetime. (This is one of the major\nteachings of the Bhagavad Gita.) To leave through a center in the head is the best, and will determine\nwhat highly evolved world he will enter. Those who leave through the center at the top of the head, the\nBrahmarandhra, will not return to rebirth. Those who leave at lower centers in the body or spine will go\nto lesser worlds, and some of the lowest centers are literally gates to negative worlds we call \u201chells.\u201d\nSome even lead to rebirth in animal forms, though this is rare.\nThe Self remains conscious, and, conscious, the dying man goes to his abode. The deeds of this life,\nand the impressions they leave behind, follow him. Some of low evolution simply go to sleep and only\nwake a little before reincarnating, and some do not even awaken until they are born. But the people to\nwhich this upanishad is addressed will certainly depart in full consciousness and will review their life\nand be aware of the psychic changes their previous actions have produced. And they will be aware of\nexactly why and how they eventually find themselves in an astral or causal realm that corresponds to\nthose karmas and samskaras. It is all a matter of learning.\nAstral birth\n\u201c\u2018As a leech, having reached the end of a blade of grass, takes hold of another blade and draws\nitself to it, so the Self, having left this body behind it unconscious, takes hold of another body\nand draws himself to it.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:3)\n\nBirth in the astral world is a conscious act. Only on earth or in the negative astral worlds do we\nmistakenly think that we are helpless and that we are not in charge. That is why the simile of a leech is\nused, and why the Sanskrit text literally says that we make another body for ourselves. And that\nhappens in earthly rebirth, too. We choose where to whom we will be born, and we enter the womb of\nour chosen mother and, taking the material provided by both parents, make our next body-habitation in\naccordance with our karma and samskara\u2013this is how powerful and intelligent we all are! Yogananda\nsaid in his Gita commentary that the individual consciously guides the growth of his body in the womb.\n(That was the first sentence of Yogananda\u2019s teaching that I read, sitting in a public library in the fall of\n1960.)\n\u201c\u2018As a goldsmith, taking an old gold ornament, molds it into another, newer and more beautiful,\nso the Self, having given up the body and left it unconscious, takes on a newer and better form,\neither that of the fathers, or that of the celestial singers, or that of the gods, or that of other\nbeings, heavenly or earthly.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:4)\nIn the higher worlds, the individual creates a body that is appropriate to the world in which he shall be\nliving until he takes rebirth\u2013also voluntarily. This experience will train him for even more efficiently\nmaking his body when he returns to earth.\nSometimes in the subtle worlds an individual takes on a body that is higher than his present\nevolutionary status and practices living on that level. This prepares him for a higher level on earth, as\nwell. This is mentioned as taking place even for animals in the forty-third chapter of Yogananda\u2019s\nautobiography, \u201cThe Resurrection of Sri Yutkeswar.\u201d\nMisidentification\n\u201c\u2018The Self is verily Brahman. Through ignorance it identifies itself with what is alien to it, and\nappears to consist of intellect, understanding, life, sight, hearing, earth, water, air, ether, fire,\ndesire and the absence of desire, anger and the absence of anger, righteousness and the absence\nof righteousness. It appears to be all things\u2013now one, now another.\n\u201c\u2018As a man acts, so does he become. A man of good deeds becomes good, a man of evil deeds\nbecomes evil. A man becomes pure through pure deeds, impure through impure deeds.\n\u201c\u2018As a man\u2019s desire is, so is his destiny. For as his desire is, so is his will; as his will is, so is his\ndeed; and as his deed is, so is his reward, whether good or bad.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\n4:4:5)\nLest in all this we forget that it is really the dream-life of the individual spirit, Yajnavalkya reminds\nJanaka of this. For in all these changes, the Self is unchanging, in all these births and deaths the Self\nremains birthless and deathless. The fact that we so easily forget this truth is evidence of how good we\nare at fooling ourselves! We are always masters of the situation.\nDesire\n\u201c\u2018A man acts according to the desires to which he clings. After death he goes to the next world\nbearing in his mind the subtle impressions of his deeds; and after reaping there the harvest of\nhis deeds, he returns again to this world of action. Thus he who has desires continues subject to\nrebirth.\n\u201c\u2018But he in whom desire is stilled suffers no rebirth. After death, having attained to the highest,\ndesiring only the Self, he goes to no other world. Realizing Brahman, he becomes Brahman.\u2019\u201d\n\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:6)\nIt is ignorance that causes our mistaken identification, but the power behind rebirth is desire. Once we\ncut off desire, rebirth is finished. Desireless, we transcend all worlds and know ourselves as Eternal\nBrahman.\n\u201c\u2018When all the desires which once entered into his heart have been driven out by divine\nknowledge, the mortal, attaining to Brahman, becomes immortal.\n\u201c\u201cAs the slough of a snake lies cast off on an anthill, so lies the body of a man at death; while\nhe, freed from the body, becomes one with the immortal spirit, Brahman, the Light Eternal.\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Sir, again I give You a thousand cows. Speak on, that I may be liberated.\u2019\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:7)\nAll glory to those that have freed themselves by knowing their Self!\n\nThe Path of Liberation\nThe path\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The path of liberation is subtle, and hard, and long. I myself am walking in\nit; nay, I have reached the end. By this path alone the wise, the knowers of Brahman, attain him\nwhile living, and achieve final liberation at death.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:8)\nYajnavalkya was obviously no pop-yogi with a yoga studio filled with yoga babes in tank tops and\nleotards confident that yoga would firm up their buttocks, eliminate cellulite, and give them the kind of\nbody they want (or that others will want). Nor was he a traveling sideshow yogi perpetually on tour\nconvincing people that yoga (his kind, at least) was cheap, easy, fun, and sure to make life a breeze. I\nknow this because of the following statements he has made:\nThe path of liberation is subtle. Without refinement of mind and the interior faculties of perception,\nyoga is not going on. Yoga is itself the purification of the mind and heart in order to allow the highest\npowers of the individual to come into play and transform his life and consciousness. Because this is so,\nPatanjali puts ten necessary elements for yoga at the top of his list of the eight limbs of yoga:\n1. Ahimsa: non-violence, non-injury, harmlessness;\n2. Satya: truthfulness, honesty;\n3. Asteya: non-stealing, honesty, non-misappropriativeness;\n4. Brahmacharya: sexual continence in thought, word and deed as well as control of all the senses;\n5. Aparigraha: non-possessiveness, non-greed, non-selfishness, non-acquisitiveness;\n6. Shaucha: purity, cleanliness;\n7. Santosha: contentment, peacefulness;\n8. Tapas: austerity, practical (i.e., result-producing) spiritual discipline;\n\n9. Swadhyaya: introspective self-study, spiritual study;\n10. Ishwarapranidhana: offering of one\u2019s life to God.\nThis is a total overhaul of external and internal life\u2013AND IT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF YOGA.\nThe path of liberation is hard. Yes, indeed. When confronted with Patanjali\u2019s list there will be a lot of\nindignation, whining and general complaint. Why? Because the path of liberation is hard! Such\nreaction is proof of that. Only the hardy even really begin the journey, and only the toughest and\nstrongest will end it successfully. This is not a path for the weak and whimsical, and it is definitely not\na mere body-splash, a hobby, or a free-time diversion. It is the attainment of Brahman, for God\u2019s sake\n(literally).\nThe path of liberation is long. It takes lifetimes\u2013many if we dawdle, and not so many if we knuckle\ndown and go for it. And believe me, those pathetic souls that boast of how they are \u201ctaking the jet-plane\nroute to God\u201d while looking and living more like a jet crash, do not have a clue. Yes, it is possible to\nrealize God in one birth\u2013the last birth. Everybody does. So we need to get busy. There can be no\nperiods of coasting along, deluding ourselves that our liberation is assured and just around the next\ncorner. (Real spiritual life goes in a straight line\u2013there no bends or curves.) Buddha meditated and\nengaged in intense discipline right up to the moment of his leaving the body, even though he had\nattained enlightenment decades before. And so did Swami Sivananda. All real yogis do the same.\nBy this path alone\u2026is Brahman attained. And that attainment is not some swell surprise after death. It\ntakes place right here in this world which is no longer an obstacle to enlightenment. By changing\nhimself the yogi changes the effect the world has on him. What hindered him before now helps him.\nThe once-closed door is now open to him. Death is the final going through that door. For him there will\nbe no return.\nNo more worlds\n\u201c\u2018Other worlds there are, joyless, enveloped in darkness. To these worlds, after death, go those\nwho are unwise, who know not the Self.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:10, 11)\nAny relative \u201cworld\u201d is fundamentally joyless and enveloped in darkness\u2013so the truly wise understand.\nNo world is fit to live in, for they are all realms of death and constant change. There is no peace\npossible for those who live therein. But those who know the Self have ended that compulsion, for:\n\u201c\u2018When a man has realized the Self, the pure, the immortal, the blissful, what craving can be\nleft in him that he should take to himself another body, full of suffering, to satisfy it?\u2019\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:12)\nDesire being the root of rebirth, when it is eliminated rebirth vanishes along with it.\nIn the body\n\u201c\u2018He that has once known the glory of the Self within the ephemeral body\u2013that stumbling-block\nto enlightenment\u2013knows that the Self is one with Brahman, lord and creator of all.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Brahman may be realized while yet one dwells in the ephemeral body. To fail to realize him is\nto live in ignorance, and therefore to be subject to birth and death. The knowers of Brahman are\nimmortal; others, knowing him not, continue in the bonds of grief.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka\nUpanishad 4:4:13,14)\n\nThe suffering may be very subtle, but it will be there, nonetheless.\nFearless in knowing\n\u201c\u2018He who with spiritual eye directly perceives the self-effulgent Being, the lord of all that was,\nis, and shall be\u2013he indeed is without fear, and causes fear in none.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka\nUpanishad 4:4:15)\nEven more, he removes fear from others. This is why we experience such great peace and ease in the\npresence of enlightened beings. Not only have I experienced this many times, I have seen people walk\ninto the presence of a great master and immediately begin shedding tears of relief. In a moment their\nanxieties and fears were removed.\n\u201c\u2018He who knows Brahman to be the life of life, the eye of the eye, the ear of the ear, the mind of\nthe mind\u2013he indeed comprehends fully the cause of all causes. By the purified mind alone is\nBrahman perceived.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:18)\nThere are no mysteries or puzzles for the knower of Brahman. All is known to him who knows The All.\n\u201c\u2018In Brahman there is no diversity. He who sees diversity goes from death to death.\u2019\u201d\n(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:19)\nAll our lives are but deaths. When we really enter into the Life that is Brahman then birth and death are\nfinished for us.\n\u201c\u2018Brahman can be apprehended only as knowledge itself\u2013knowledge that is one with reality,\ninseparable from it. For he is beyond all proof, beyond all instruments of thought. The eternal\nBrahman is pure, unborn, subtler than the subtlest, greater than the greatest.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka\nUpanishad 4:4:20)\nTherefore:\n\u201c\u2018Let therefore the wise aspirant, knowing Brahman to be the supreme goal, so shape his life\nand his conduct that he may attain to him. Let him not seek to know him by arguments, for\narguments are idle and vain.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:21)\nWe need only to reshape our life and go directly to God, not bothering with critics or nay-sayers. Just\nsmile, wave, and go on to the Goal.\nKnow you the journey that I take?\nKnow you the voyage that I make?\nThe joy of it one\u2019s heart could break.\nNo jot of time have I to spare,\nNor will to loiter anywhere,\nSo eager am I to be there.\nFor that the way is hard and long,\nFor that gray fears upon it throng,\nI set my journey to a song,\nAnd it grows wondrous happy so.\nSinging I hurry on for oh!\n\nIt is to God, to God, I go.\nSister M. Madeleva, C.S.C.\n\nSome Final Words\nSince there are three short parts remaining to be considered, I am putting them in this one closing essay.\nThe Great Unborn\n\u201c\u2018Verily is Brahman the great unborn that dwells within the lotus of the heart, surrounded by the\nsenses. He is the intellect of the intellect, protector of all, king of all, lord of all. Good works do\nnot make him more, nor do evil works make him less. Lord, king, protector of all, he transcends\nthe three worlds.\n\u201c\u2018Devotees seek to know him by study, by sacrifice, by continence, by austerity, by detachment.\nTo know him is to become a seer. Desiring to know him, and him alone, monks renounce the\nworld. Realizing the glory of the Self, the sages of old craved not sons nor daughters. \u201cWhat\nhave we to do with sons and daughters,\u201d they asked, \u201cwe who have known the Self, we who\nhave achieved the supreme goal of existence?\u201d No longer desiring progeny, nor wealth, nor life\nin other worlds, they entered upon the path of complete renunciation.\n\u201c\u2018Craving for progeny leads to craving for wealth, and craving for wealth leads to craving for\nlife in other worlds. Two cravings there are: the craving for a life of pleasure in this world, and\nthe craving for a life of greater pleasure in other worlds.\n\u201c\u2018The Self is to be described as Not This, Not That. It is incomprehensible, for it cannot be\ncomprehended; undecaying, for it never decays; unattached, for it never attaches itself;\nunfettered, for it is never bound. He who knows the Self is unaffected, whether by good or by\nevil. Never do such thoughts come to him as \u201cI have done an evil thing\u201d or \u201cI have done a good\nthing.\u201d Both good and evil he has transcended, and he is therefore troubled no more by what he\nmay or may not have done.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:22)\nVerily is Brahman the great unborn that dwells within the lotus of the heart, surrounded by the senses.\nThe ultimate Self of all is Brahman that dwells in each sentient being. It can be said of each of them\nwhat Saint Paul said about Jesus: \u201cIn him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.\u201d (Colossians\n2:9) The difference between Jesus (and any Master) and other sentient beings is that he knew the\nIndweller and they do not. The Self is surrounded by the senses like someone in a theater that has a\n360-degree screen, or like someone seated surrounded by video monitors. All of us really are \u201cin the\npicture,\u201d and that is most of our problem.\nHe is the intellect of the intellect. Every faculty, every quality we possess, is derived from the Self and\nhas its primal archetype in Brahman. This is because everything exists within Brahman as an eternal\npotential.\nProtector of all, king of all, lord of all. This extremely important. The upanishads continually remind us\nthat Brahman is transcendent and beyond all qualities or conception. Yet here we see that Brahman has\nan intimate relation with all creation, is in contact with all things, and controls all things. Brahman is\nalso Ishwara, the Lord. So it is an error to try to push Brahman completely out of the picture and exile\nIt to a void that is antithetical to all we presently know or are. Brahman is indeed both This and That. In\na short while we will be examining a verse that sums this up quite well.\n\nGood works do not make him more, nor do evil works make him less. Brahman never acts, as both the\nupanishads and the Gita insist. So what does this mean? It means that the actions of sentient beings in\nno way change the Self, nor do they increase or decrease the presence of the Self. However, good\nactions do help us to perceive the Self as present, and evil actions dim our mental vision and cause us\nto lose awareness of the Self. Because of that we may think that the Self is affected and drawn closer or\npushed away, but we will be wrong. Reality is untouched and unaffected by our delusions and illusions.\nThe rest of the verse is quite clear, only needing a careful and reflective reading.\nThe Brahman-knower\n\u201c\u2018The eternal glory of the knower of Brahman, beginningless and endless, revealed by divine\nknowledge, is neither increased nor decreased by deeds. Let a man therefore seek to obtain it,\nsince having obtained it he can never be touched by evil. Self-controlled is he who knows the\nSelf, tranquil, poised, free from desire. Absorbed in meditating upon it, he sees it within his own\nsoul, and he sees all beings in it. Evil touches him not, troubles him not, for in the fire of his\ndivine knowledge all evil is burnt away. Freed from evil, freed from desire, freed from doubt, he\nbecomes a knower of Brahman. This, O King, is the truth of Brahman. Do thou attain to it!\u2019\n\u201cJanaka said: \u2018Most revered sir, I offer you the empire of Videha\u2013and myself with it\u2013to be your\nservant.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:23)\nOur gratitude for this wisdom should be as boundless and all-encompassing as was Janaka\u2019s. Who can\ncalculate the lives we have passed, struggling to comprehend the truth of things, before at last these\ngreat truths have come into the sphere of our life and become known to us? May we now hasten to the\nrealization of Yajnavalkya\u2019s final summation:\n\u201cYajnavalkya said: \u2018The Self, the great unborn, the undecaying, the undying, the immortal, the\nfearless, is, in very truth, Brahman. He who knows Brahman is without fear. He who knows\nBrahman becomes Brahman!\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4:25)\nThat and This\nThe simultaneous immanent and transcendent nature of Brahman (and the Self) is not easy to grasp.\nBut the first half of the following verse is very helpful.\n\u201cThat is the Full, this is the Full. The Full has come out of the Full. If we take the Full from the\nFull Only the Full remains.\n\u201cOm is the ether-Brahman\u2013the eternal ether. It is the Veda known by the knowers of Brahman.\nFor through it one knows what is to be known.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 5:1:1)\nThe word translated \u201cfull\u201d is purna, which means both \u201cfull\u201d and \u201ccomplete.\u201d In this verse it means the\ntotality of being: Brahman. So it tells us that the Transcendent (Nirguna Brahman) is the total Reality;\nbut so is the Immanent (Saguna Brahman). The Unmanifest is all that is\u2013and so is the Manifest. The\nImmanent is a emanation from the Transcendent. If we confine our awareness to the Immanent we will\nfind it to be the Totality of Being. If we turn to the Transcendent and intellectually negate the\nImmanent, we will perceive that the Transcendent is All. How is this? Because they are one and the\nsame. Further, Brahman cannot be labeled or described, so even the words immanent and transcendent\ncannot be applied to It.\nThe second verse is extremely significant, telling us that Om is Brahman vibrating eternally in the\n\nEther. That for those who know Brahman, Om is the real Veda, for it reveals all that is to be known:\nBrahman Itself.\nDa! Da! Da!\n\u201cGods, men, and asuras\u2013all three descendants of Prajapati\u2013lived with him for a time as students.\n\u201cThen the gods said: \u2018Teach us, sir!\u2019 In reply Prajapati uttered one syllable: \u2018Da.\u2019 Then he said:\n\u2018Have you understood?\u2019 They answered, \u2018Yes, we have understood. You said to us,\n\u2018\u201cDamayata\u2013Be self-controlled.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 agreed Prajapati, \u2018you have understood.\u2019\n\u201cThen the men said: \u2018Teach us, sir.\u2019 Prajapati uttered the same syllable: \u2018Da.\u2019 Then he said:\n\u2018Have you understood?\u2019 They answered, \u2018Yes, we have understood. You said to us, \u2018\u201cDatta\u2013Be\ncharitable.\u2019\u201d \u2018Yes,\u2019 agreed Prajapati, \u2018you have understood.\u2019\n\u201cThen the asuras said: \u2018Teach us, sir.\u2019 Prajapati uttered the same syllable: \u2018Da.\u2019 Then he said:\n\u2018Have you understood?\u2019 They said, \u2018Yes, we have understood. You told us \u2018\u201cDayadhwam\u2013Be\ncompassionate.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 agreed Prajapati, \u2018you have understood.\u2019\n\u201cThe storm cloud thunders: \u2018Da! Da! Da!\u2013\u2018Be self-controlled! Be charitable! Be\ncompassionate!\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 5:2:1-3)\nGods, men, and asuras make up our present human nature. The gods are the parts of us that are superior\nto the normal human condition. They have arisen as we have begun to evolve to the point where we can\ntake the next step up on the evolutionary ladder. Men are our human traits, and the asuras are the\nanimal traits that we have brought along with us in our evolutionary journey. Consequently the advice\nto be self-controlled, charitable, and compassionate applies to us. And its following will ensure our\ncontinued evolution.\nEnd of Brihadaranyaka Commentary",
    "Brahma": "\n\nBrahma Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Madhavananda\nPublished by Advaita Ashram, Kolkatta\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. Om ! Shaunaka, householder of fame, once asked Bhagavan Pippalada of Angira\u2019s family: In this\nbody, the divine city of Brahman, installed, how do they create ? Whose glory does this constitute ?\nWho is he who became all this glory ?\n2. Unto him (Shaunaka) he (Pippalada) imparted the supreme Wisdom of Brahman: That is Prana, the\nAtman. He constitutes the glory of the Atman, the life of the Devas. He represents both the life and the\ndeath of the Devas. That Brahman who shines within the divine Brahmapura (or body) as the faultless\nOne, devoid of manifested effects, self-effulgent, all-pervading, He (it is who) controls (the Jiva), like a\nspider controlling the king of bees. Just as spiders by means of one thread project and withdraw the\nweb, so also the Prana, (who) retires drawing back his creation. Prana belongs to the Nadis or subtle\nnerve-chords as their Devata or indwelling deity. One in dreamless sleep goes through that state to\none\u2019s own Abode, like a falcon and the sky \u2013 just as a falcon goes (to its nest) borne on the sky. He\nstates: -- Just as this Devadatta (in dreamless sleep) runs not away even when struck with a stick, even\nso he does not also attach himself to good or evil consequences of the life\u2019s ordained activities; just as a\nchild enjoys itself (spontaneously) without motive or desiring fruit, even so this Devadatta (the subject\nof dreamless sleep) enjoys happiness in that state. He knows being the Light Supreme. Desiring Light\nhe enjoys the Light. So also he returns by the same way to the dream-state, like a leech: just as a leech\ncarries itself on to the other points in front \u2013 (first) fixing upon the next point. And that state which he\ndoes not give up for a next one is called the waking state. (He carries all these states within himself)\njust as a (Vedic) deity bears the eight sacrificial cups simultaneously. It is from Him that the source of\n\nthe Vedas and the Devas hang like breasts. In this waking state particularly good and evil obtain for the\nshining being (i.e. man\u2019s Self) as ordained. This being or Self is fully self-extended (into world-forms),\nhe is the indwelling controller of things and beings, he is the Bird, the Crab, the Lotus, he is the\nPurusha, the Prana, the destroyer, the cause and the effect, the Brahman and the Atman, he is the\nDevata making everything known. Whoever knows all this attains to the transcendent Brahman, the\nunderlying support, the subjective principle.\n3. Now this Purusha has four seats, the navel, the heart, the throat, and the head. In these shines forth\nthe Brahman with four aspects: the state of wakefulness, of dream, of dreamless sleep, and the fourth or\ntranscendental state. In the wakeful state, He is Brahma; in the dreaming state, He is Vishnu; in\ndreamless sleep He is Rudra; and the fourth state is the Supreme Indestructible One; and He again is\nthe Sun, the Vishnu, the Ishwara, He is the Purusha, He the Prana, He the Jive or the animate being, He\nthe Fire, The Ishwara, and the Resplendent; (yea) that Brahman which is transcendent shines within all\nthese ! In Itself, It is devoid of mind, of ears, of hands and feet, of light. There neither are the worlds\nexisting nor non-existing, neither are the Vedas or the Devas or the sacrifices existing nor non-existing,\nneither is the mother or father or daughter-in-law existing nor non-existing, neither is Chandala\u2019s son or\nPulkasa\u2019s son existing nor non-existing, neither is the mendicant existing nor non-existing, so neither\nall the creatures or the ascetics; and thus only the One Highest Brahman shines there. Within the recess\nof the heart is that Akasa of consciousness \u2013 that with many openings, the aim of knowledge, within the\nspace of the heart \u2013 in which all this (universe outside) evolves and moves about, in which all this is\nwarped and woofed (as it were). (Who knows this), knows fully all creation. There the Devas, the\nRishis, the Pitris have no control, for being fully awakened, one becomes the knower of all truth.\n4. In the heart the Devas live, in the heart the Pranas are installed, in the heart exist the supreme Prana\nand Light as also the immanent Cause with threefold constituents and the Mahat principle.\n5. It exists within this heart, that is, in the consciousness. \u201cPut on the sacrificial thread which is\nsupremely sacred, which became manifest of yore with Prajapati (the first created Being) Himself,\nwhich embodies longevity, eminence and purity, and may it be strength and puissance to you !\u201d\n6. The enlightened one should discard the external thread putting it off with the sacred tuft of hair on\nthe head; the Supreme Brahman as the all-pervading one is the thread, and he should put this on.\n7. The Sutra (or thread) is so called because of its having pierced through and started (the process of\nbecoming). This Sutra verily constitutes the Supreme State. By whom this Sutra is known, he is the\nVipra (sage), he has reached beyond the Vedas.\n8. By It all this (universe) is transfixed, as a collection of gems is stringed together on a thread. The\nYogi who is the knower of all Yogas and the seer of truth should put on this thread.\n9. Established in the state of highest Yoga, the wise one should put off the external thread. One who is\nreally self-conscious must put on the thread constituted by awareness of Brahman.\n10. On account of wearing this Sutra or thread, they can neither become contaminated nor unclean,\nthose (namely) who have this thread existing within them \u2013 those, with this sacrificial thread of\nknowledge.\n11. They, among men, (really) know the Sutra, they (really) wear the sacrificial thread (on themselves),\nwho are devoted to Jnana (the highest knowledge), who have this Jnana for their sacred hair-tuft, this\nJnana for their sacred thread.\n12. For them Jnana is the greatest purifier \u2013 Jnana, that is the best as such. Those who have this Jnana\nfor their tufted hair are as non-different from it as is fire from its flame. This wise one is (really) said to\nbe a Shikhi (or wearer of the tufted hair), while others are mere growers of hair (on the head).\n13. But those belonging to the three castes (Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas) who have the right of\nperforming Vedic works have to put on this (i.e. the common) sacred thread, as surely this thread is\nordained to be part of such works.\n14. One who has the Jnana for his tufted hair, and the same for his sacred thread, has everything about\nhim characterised by Brahmanahood \u2013 so know the knowers of the Vedas !\n\n15. This sacred thread (of Yajna, i.e. of the all-pervading Reality) is, again, the purification (itself) and\nthat which is the end-all (of Vedic works); and the wearer of this thread is the wise one \u2013 is Yajna\nhimself as well as the knower of Yajna.\n16. The One Lord (self-effulgent) in all beings remaining hidden, all-pervading and the Self of all\nbeings, controlling and watching over all works (good or bad), living in all creatures and the Witness\n(i.e. neither the doer of any acts nor the enjoyer), the Supreme Intelligence, the One without a second,\nhaving no attributes.\n17. The one Intelligent (active) Being among the many inactive, He who makes the many from what is\none \u2013 the wise men who find out this Self, theirs is the eternal peace, not of others.\n18. Having made oneself the Arani, and the Pranava the upper Arani and rubbing them together through\nthe practice of meditation, see the Lord in His hidden reality.\n19. As in the oil in the sesamum seed, the butter in the curd, water in the flowing waves, and fire in the\nShami wood, so is the Atman in one\u2019s self to be discovered by one who searches for It through truth\nand austere practice.\n20. As the spider weaves out the web and again withdraws it, so the Jiva comes out to and goes back\nagain to the wakeful and dreaming states respectively.\n21. The heart (i.e. the inner chamber of heart) resembles the calyx of a lotus, full of cavities and also\nwith its face turned downwards. Know that to be the great habitat of the whole universe.\n22. Know the wakeful state to have for its centre the eyes; the dreaming state should be assigned to the\nthroat; the state of dreamless sleep is in the heart; and the transcendental state is in the crown of the\nhead.\n23. From the fact of an individual holding his self by means of Prajna or spiritual understanding in the\nSupreme Self, we have what is called Sandhya and Dhyana, as also the worshipping associated with\nSandhya.\n24. The Sandhya by meditation is devoid of any offering of liquids and so also of any exertion of body\nand speech; it is the unifying principle for all creatures, and this is really the Sandhya for Ekadandis.\n26. From which without reaching It, the speech falls back with the mind, that is the transcendental Bliss\nof this embodied being, knowing which the wise one is released (from all bondage).\n26. (And this Bliss is verily) the Self which pervades the whole universe, as the butter diffused within\nthe milk.\nThis is the Brahmopanishad, or the supreme wisdom of Brahman, in the form of a unity of the Atman\nof all, founded on the spiritual discipline (Tapas) which is (nothing but) the Vidya or science of the\nAtman.\nOm !

    "Kaivalya": "\nKaivalya Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Madhavananda\nPublished by Advaita Ashram, Kolkatta\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. Then Ashvalayana approached the Lord Paramesthi (Brahma) and said: Teach, O Lord, the\nknowledge of Brahman, the highest, always cultivated by the good, hidden and by which a wise man\ndrives away instantly all the sins and reaches the Purusha higher than the high.\n2. And to him, the Grandsire (Brahma) said, \"Know (this) by means of faith, devotion and meditation.\nNot by work, nor by progeny, nor by wealth, but by renunciation, some attained immortality.\n3. Higher than heaven, seated in the cave (Buddhi), that shines, (which) the self-controlled attain \u2013 the\nself-controlled, who being of pure minds have well ascertained the Reality, by the knowledge of\nVedanta, and through Sannyasa or renunciation. In the sphere of Brahma, at the time of cosmic\ndissolution, they all get liberated from the highest (apparent) immortality of the manifested universe.\n4-5. In a secluded place, sitting in an easy posture, pure, with a neck, head, and body erect, living in the\nlast of the orders of religious life, having controlled all the sense, saluting his own preceptor with\nreverence, meditating within the lotus of the heart (on Brahman), untainted, pure, clear and griefless.\n6. (Who is) unthinkable, unmanifest, of endless forms, the good, the peaceful, Immortal, the origin of\nthe worlds, without beginning, middle, and end, the only one, all-pervading, Consciousness, and Bliss,\nthe formless and the wonderful.\n7. Meditating on the highest Lord, allied to Uma, powerful, three-eyed, blue-necked, and tranquil, the\nholy man reaches Him who is the source of all, the witness of all and is beyond darkness (i.e. Avidya).\n8. He is Brahma, He is Shiva, He is Indra, He is the Immutable, the Supreme, the Self-luminous, He\nalone is Vishnu, He is Prana, He is Time and Fire, He is the Moon.\n\n9. He alone is all that was, and all that will be, the Eternal; knowing Him, one transcends death; there is\nno other way to freedom.\n10. Seeing the Atman in all beings, and all beings in the Atman, one attains the highest Brahman \u2013 not\nby any other means.\n11. Making the Atman the (lower) Arani, and OM the upper Arani, by the repeated friction of\nknowledge, a wise man burns up the bond.\n12. With his self thus deluded by Maya or ignorance, it is he who identifies himself with the body and\ndoes all sorts of things. In the waking state it is he (the Jiva) who attains satisfaction through the varied\nobjects of enjoyment, such as women, food, drink, etc.\n13. In the dream-state that Jiva feels pleasure and pain in a sphere of existence created by his own\nMaya or ignorance. During the state of profound sleep, when everything is dissolved (into their causal\nstate), he is overpowered by Tams or non-manifestation and comes to exist in his form of Bliss.\n14. Again, through his connection with deeds done in previous births, that very Jiva returns to the\ndream-state, or the waking state. The being who sports in the three cities (viz., the states of\nwakefulness, dream and profound sleep) \u2013 from Him has sprung up all diversity. He is the substratum,\nthe bliss, the indivisible Consciousness, in whom the three cities dissolve themselves.\n15. From This spring up Prana (Vitality), mind, all the organs, sky, air, fire, water and the earth that\nsupports all.\n16. That which is the Supreme Brahman, the soul of all, the great support of the universe, subtler than\nthe subtle, and eternal \u2013 that is thyself, and thou art That.\n17. \"That which manifests the phenomena, such as the states of wakefulness, dream and profound\nsleep, I am that Brahman\" \u2013 realising thus one is liberated from all bonds.\n18. What constitute the enjoyable, the enjoyer, and the enjoyment, in the three abodes \u2013 different from\nthem all am I, the Witness, the Pure Consciousness, the Eternal Good.\n19. In me alone is everything born, in me does everything rest, and in me is everything dissolved. I am\nthat Brahman, the secondless.\n20. I am minuter than the minute, I am likewise the greatest of all, I am the manifold universe. I am the\nAncient One, the Purusha and the Ruler, I am the Effulgent One, and the All-good.\n21. Without arms and legs am I, of unthinkable power; I see without eyes, and I hear without ears. I\nknow all, and am different from all. None can know me. I am always the Intelligence.\n22. I alone am taught in the various Vedas, I am the revealer of the Vedanta or Upanishads, and I am\nalso the Knower of the Vedas. For me there is neither merit nor demerit, I suffer no destruction, I have\nno birth, nor any self-identity with the body and the organs.\n23-24. For me there is neither earth, nor water, nor fire, nor air, nor ether. Thus realising the\nParamatman, who lies in the cavity of the heart, who is without parts, and without a second, the\nWitness of all, beyond both existence and non-existence \u2013 one attains the Pure Paramatman Itself.\n25. He who studies the Shatarudriya, is purified as by the Fires, is purified from the sin of drinking,\npurified from the sin of killing a Brahmana, from deeds done knowingly or unawares. Through this he\nhas his refuge in Shiva, the Supreme Self. One who belongs to the highest order of life should repeat\nthis always or once (a day).\n26. By means of this, one attains the Knowledge that destroys the ocean of Samsara or repeated\ntransmigration. Therefore, knowing thus one attains the fruit of Kaivalya or liberation, verily one\nattains liberation.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm !

    "Jabala": "\nJabala Upanishad\nTranslated by Prof. A. A. Ramanathan\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nI-1. Brihaspati (the preceptor of the gods) asked (the sage) Yajnavalkya: (Which is) the Kurukshetra,\n(the famous holy place that destroys sins and protects the good, (the place) where the gods perform\nsacrifices and which is the abode of Brahman in all beings ? (Yajnavalkya replied): Avimukta is the\nKurukshetra, (the place) where the gods perform sacrifices to deities and which is the abode of\nBrahman in all beings (i.e. the middle of the eye-brows). Hence wherever one goes one shall think thus:\nThis is the Kurukshetra, the place where the gods perform sacrifices to the deities and which is the\nabode of Brahman in all beings. This is the spot where, when the vital airs depart from the living\nperson, Rudra imparts the mantra (Taraka Brahman) to him by which, becoming immortal, he attains\nliberation (final beatitude). Hence one shall resort to the Avimukta; shall not desert the Avimukta.\n(Brihaspati approved of the statement saying): \u2018So it is, Yajnavalkya\u2019, verily it is so, O, revered one ! \u2018It\nis so Yajnavalkya\u2019.\nII-1. Thereafter the sage Atri (son of the creator Brahma) asked of Yajnavalkya: \u2018How am I to realize\nthe Self which is infinite and unmanifest ?\u2019 (To this) Yajnavalkya replied: That Avimukta (Lord Siva as\nthe redeemer) is to be worshipped; the Self which is infinite and unmanifest, is established in (i.e., is\nnon-different from) the Avimukta (in Ishvara, possessed of attributes)\u2019.\nII-2. \u2018Which is that (place) where Avimukta is established ?\u2019 \u2018He is established in between varana and\nnasi\u2019. \u2018What is (meant by) varana and what (by) nasi ?\u2019 \u2018The varana is so called as it wards off all the\nfaults committed by the (ten) organs (of perception and action). The nasi is so named as it destroys all\n\nsins committed by the (ten) organs. (The place between the varana and the nasi is the meeting place of\nthe upper part of the nose and the centre of the eye brows). \u2018Which is the seat of that (Avimukta) ?\u2019\n\u2018That, which is the (well known) juncture of the eye brows and the nose, is the juncture of heaven (in\nthe form of the crown of the head) and this world (in the form at the end of the chin). The knowers of\nthe Veda worship indeed this juncture (Samadhi) as Sandhya (in their daily worship). That Avimukta is\nto be worshipped. He who knows this thus (the true nature of the Avimukta), imparts the wisdom of the\nAvimukta (that the individual Self is no other than the attributeless Brahman, to his disciples).\nIII-1. Then the discipline students (Brahmacharins of Yajnavalkya) asked him: \u2018Pray, tell us, what is\nthat mantra by reciting which one attains immortality ?\u2019 He replied: \u2018By (reciting) Satarudriya\u2019. These\nmantras are indeed the names of (Rudra to achieve) immortality. By (reciting) these (mantras) one\nbecomes immortal.\nIV-1. Then Janaka, the king of the Videhas (respectfully) approached Yajnavalkya and requested him:\n\u2018Revered Sir, expound (to me) the (tenets of) renunciation (Sannyasa)\u2019. He (Yajnavalkya) then replied:\n\u2018After completing the period of disciplined studentship (brahmacharya) one may become a\nhouseholder. After being a householder he may become a forest-dweller (i.e., become a Vanaprastha).\nHaving become a Vanaprastha he may renounce the world (and thus become a mendicant monk). Or,\nalternately, he may embrace renunciation from brahmacharya itself, or from the (stage of a)\nhouseholder, or from the forest(-life of a Vanaprastha). (It can also be that) a person may renounce\nworldly life that very day on which distaste for it dawns on him, whether he is one not observing the\nvows (before the stage of renunciation) or observe them, whether he has undergone the prescribed\nablution on completing the disciplined studentship or not, whether he is one who has discontinued\nmaintaining the sacred fire at the death of his wife (utsannagni) or is one who does not maintain (for\nother causes) the sacred fire (anagnika).\nIv-2. Some (law givers) prescribe the sacrifice called prajapatya (of which the god Brahma is the\npresiding deity, to a twice-born before he embraces renunciation). But (though thus laid down) he may\nnot do so. He shall only perform the sacrifice in which Agni is the deity. For Agni is the vital breath\n(Prana). Thereby he does (strengthen) the vital breath. He shall then perform the traidhataviya sacrifice.\nFor the three forms of Agni in him, namely, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are (strengthened) by this\nsacrifice. (Having performed the sacrifice) he shall smell (the smoke of) the holy fire, reciting the\nfollowing mantra:\nIV-3. \u2018O Fire, this (vital breath) is your source; as you are born from Sutratman (at the proper time) you\nshine forth. Knowing him (the Atman, your ultimate source) may you merge (in him). May you\nincrease our wealth\u2019 (here the transcendent knowledge). Verily, this is the source of fire, namely the\nvital air. So what is said by this mantra is: \u2018May you go unto your source\u2019. Svaha.\nIV-4. Having procured the holy fire from (the house of a well-versed Vedic scholar in) the village he\nshall smell the holy dire as described previously. If he is unable to procure the holy fire he shall offer\nthe oblations in water. For water is, verily, all the gods. Reciting \u2018I offer the oblation to all the gods,\nSvaha\u2019 he shall tender the oblation and picking up (a small portion of) the offered oblation which is\nmixed with ghee, he shall eat it, as this is beneficial. The mantra of liberation (namely \u2018Om\u2019) is (the\nessence of) the three Vedas; this he shall realize. It is Brahman and It is to be worshipped. Indeed, so it\nis, O revered Yajnavalkya (said Janaka).\nV-1. Then the (sage) Atri asked Yajnavalkya: \u2018May I ask you Yajnavalkya, how is one without the\nsacred thread a Brahmana ?\u2019 Yajnavalkya replied: (\u2018The conviction I am the) Self alone is his sacred\nthread. He shall then sip water (ceremoniously thrice). This is the method enjoined on those who\nrenounce worldly life\u2019.\nV-2. (In the case of Kshatriyas and others not entitled to renunciation, they may seek liberation) in the\n\npath of the brave (who court death in the battle field) or fast (unto death as a discipline), or enter into\nwater (to rise no more) or enter fire (to be burnt to ashes) or undertake the great journey (in which they\ncollapse by exhaustion).\nV-3. Then (in the case of those entitled to renunciation) the mendicant monk wearing (ochre) coloured\ngarment, with shaven head, accepting nothing (excepting food for bare sustenance), being pure,\ninjuring none (in thought, word and deed), (austerity) living on alms, becomes fit for realizing\nBrahman. If sorely afflicted (by disease, etc.,) he may renounce the world by mental resolve, or by\nspoken words uttering mantras. This way (of renunciation) has been prescribed by Brahma (the creator,\nin the Vedanta); the ascetic (the Sannyasin who has renounced the world) following this path realizes\nBrahman. \u2018Thus indeed it is, O, revered Yajnavalkya\u2019 (appreciated Janaka).\nVI-1. There are sages called Paramahamsas (as in the days of yore, the sages) Samvartaka, Aruni,\nSvetaketu, Durvasas, Ribhu, Nidagha, Jadabharata, Dattatreya, Raivataka and others, wearing no\ndistinguishing marks, with conduct beyond the ken (of worldly people) and who behaved as though\nbereft of their senses though (perfectly) sane.\nVI-2. Discarding all these, namely the threefold staff (of bamboo), the water pot, the sling (to carry\npersonal effects), the (alms-)bowl, the cloth for purifying water (tied to the staff), tuft of hair and sacred\nthread in water (i.e. a reservoir) by reciting \u2018Bhuh Svaha\u2019, the Paramahamsa shall seek the Atman.\nVI-3. Possessing a form as one just born (i.e. unclad), unaffected by the pairs (of opposites, such as\nheat and cold, pleasure and pain), accepting nothing (except bare sustenance), well established in the\npath of the truth of Brahman, of pure mind, receiving alms into the mouth (literally into the vessel of\nthe belly) at the prescribed hour in order to sustain life, becoming equanimous at gain or loss (of alms),\nsheltering himself, without an abode (of his own), in an unoccupied house, a temple, a clump of (tall)\ngrass (or a heap of straw), an anthill, the shade of a tree, a potter\u2019s hut, a cottage where sacred fire is\nkept, sandy bank of a river, a mountain thicket or cavity, a hollow in a tree, the vicinity of a water fall\nor a piece of clean ground; making no efforts (in any kind of gainful activity), free from \u2018mineness\u2019 (i.e.\na sense of possessiveness), ever meditating on Brahman, devoted to the Self, ever intent on eradication\nof the good and bad karman, (the sage) finally gives up his body in the state of renunciation \u2013 (such a\nsage) is indeed a Paramahamsa. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Jabalopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Svetasva": "\nSvetasvatara Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Tyagisananda\nPublished by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai\nOm! May Brahman protect us both together.\nMay He nourish us both together.\nMay we both work together, with great energy.\nMay our study be vigorous and effective.\nMay we not hate each other.\nOm! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nI-1: Students of Brahman (i.e. the Vedas) discuss (among themselves): What is the cause ? (Is it)\nBrahman ? Whence are we born ? Why do we live ? Where is our final rest ? Under whose orders are\nwe, who know the Brahman, subjected to the law of happiness and misery ?\nI-2: Time, nature, law, chance, matter, energy, intelligence \u2013 neither these, nor combination of these,\ncan bear examination because of their own birth, identity and the existence of the self. The self also is\nnot a free agent, being under the sway of happiness and misery.\nI-3: Practising the method of meditation, they realized that Being who is the God of religion, the Self of\nphilosophy and the Energy of science; who exists as the self-luminous power in everyone; who is the\nsource of the intellect, emotions and will; who is one without a second; who presides over all the\ncauses enumerated above, beginning with time and ending with the individual soul; and who had been\nincomprehensible because of the limitations of their own intellect.\nI-4: We think of Him as the universe resembling a wheel which has one felly with a triple tyre, sixteen\nextremities, fifty spokes, twenty counter-spokes and six sets of eight; which is driven along three\ndifferent roads by means of a belt that is single yet manifold; and which each revolution gives rise to\ntwo.\nI-5: We think of Him (in His manifestation as the universe) who is like a river that contains the waters\nof five streams; that has five big turnings due to five causes; that has the five Pranas for the waves, the\nmind \u2013 the basis of five-fold perception \u2013 for the source, and the five-fold misery for its rapids; and that\nhas five whirlpools, five branches and innumerable aspects.\nI-6: In this infinite wheel of Brahman, in which everything lives and rests, the pilgrim soul is whirled\n\nabout. Knowing the individual soul, hitherto regarded as separate, to be itself the Moving Force, and\nblessed by Him, it attains immortality.\nI-7: This is expressly declared to be the Supreme Brahman. In that is the triad. It is the firm support,\nand it is the imperishable. Knowing the inner essence of this, the knowers of Veda become devoted to\nBrahman, merge themselves in It, and are released from birth.\nI-8: The Lord supports this universe, which consists of a combination of the perishable and the\nimperishable, the manifest and the unmanifest. As long as the self does not know the Lord, it gets\nattached to worldly pleasures, and is bound; but when it knows Him, all fetters fall away from it.\nI-9: The conscious subject and the unconscious object, the master and the dependent, are both unborn.\nShe, too, who is engaged in bringing about the relation of the enjoyer and the enjoyed (or between\nthese two), is unborn. When all these three are realized as Brahman, the self becomes infinite, universal\nand free from the sense of agentship.\nI-10: Matter is perishable, but God is imperishable and immortal. He, the only God, rules over the\nperishable matter and individual souls. By meditating on him, by uniting with Him, and by becoming\none with Him, there is cessation of all illusion in the end.\nI-11: With the knowledge of God, all fetters fall off. With the waning of ignorance, birth and death\ncease. Going beyond the consciousness of the body by meditating on Him, one reaches the third state,\nviz., the universal lordship. All his desires are satisfied, and he becomes one without a second.\nI-12: This is to be known as eternally existing in one\u2019s own self. Indeed, there is nothing to be known\nbeyond this. As a result of meditation the enjoyer, the enjoyed and the power which brings about the\nenjoyment \u2013 all are declared to be the three aspects of Brahman.\nI-13: Fire is not perceived in its source, the fire-stick, till it is ignited by percussion. The subtle essence\nof fire, nevertheless, is not absent in the stick; for fire can be obtained from the source, the fire-stick, by\nstriking again. (The state of the Atman before and after realization). By meditating on the Pranava, the\nAtman is perceived manifestly in the body, (but it was there in a latent state even before realization).\nI-14: Making one\u2019s own body the lower piece of wood, and the Pranava the upper piece of wood, and\npractising churning in the form of meditation, one should realize God as one would find out something\nhidden.\nI-15-16: As oil in sesame seeds, as butter in curds, as water in underground springs, as fire in wood,\neven so this Self is perceived in the self. He who, by means of truthfulness, self-control and\nconcentration, looks again and again for this Self, which is all-pervading like butter contained in milk,\nand which is rooted in self-knowledge and meditation \u2013 he becomes that Supreme Brahman, the\ndestroyer of ignorance.\nII-1: First harnessing the mind and the senses with a view to realizing the Truth, and then having found\nout the light of the fire, the Evolving Soul brought itself out of the earth.\nII-2: With our minds controlled so as to manifest the self-luminous Immanent Soul, we shall vigorously\nendeavour for the attainment of supreme bliss.\nII-3: Controlling the heaven-aspiring senses with the help of the mind and the intellect, the Immanent\nSoul so regenerates them as to enable them to manifest the self-luminous Infinite Light.\nII-4: Great is the glory of the Immanent Soul who is all-pervading, all-knowing, infinite and selfluminous. Only those rare few who know, undergo the necessary discipline and spiritual practices. The\nwise do, indeed, control the activities of the intellect, and practise meditation and concentration.\nII-5: Following only in the footsteps of the wise, I merge you both in the ancient Brahman by continued\nmeditation. May the Glorious One manifest Himself ! May the sons of Immortal Bliss hearken to me \u2013\neven they who occupy celestial regions !\nII-6: Where fire is churned out, where air is controlled, where Soma juice overflows \u2013 there the mind\nattains perfection.\nII-7: Attaining whom thou destroyest the source and art no more troubled by the results of past actions\n\n\u2013 to that ancient Brahman be thou devoted through the Prime Cause, the Immanent Soul.\nII-8: Placing the body in a straight posture, holding the chest, throat and head erect, and drawing the\nsenses and the mind into the heart, the knowing one should cross over all the fearful currents by means\nof the raft of Brahman.\nII-9: Controlling the senses with an effort, and regulating the activities in the body, one should breathe\nout through the nostrils when the vital activities become gentle. Then the knowing one, without being\nin the least distracted, should keep his hold on the mind as on the reins attached to restive horses.\nII-10: One should perform one\u2019s exercises in concentration, resorting to caves and such other pure\nplaces helpful to its practice \u2013 places where the ground is level without pebbles, and the scenery\npleasing to the eyes; where there is no wind, dust, fire, dampness and disturbing noises.\nII-11: Forms that appear like snow, smoke, sun, wind, fire, fire-fly, lightning, crystal and moon, precede\nthe manifestation of Brahman in Yoga practice.\nII-12: When the fivefold perception of Yoga, arising from (concentrating the mind on) earth, water,\nlight, air and ether, have appeared to the Yogin, then he has become possessed of a body made of the\nfire of Yoga, and he will not be touched by disease, old age or death.\nII-13: It is said that the first signs of entering Yoga are lightness of body, health, thirstlessness of mind,\nclearness of complexion, a beautiful voice, an agreeable odour and scantiness excretions.\nII-14: Just as the same metal disc, which was stained by dust before, shines brilliantly when cleaned, so\nthe embodied being, seeing the truth of Atman, realizes oneness, attains the goal and becomes\nsorrowless.\nII-15: When the Yogin realizes the truth of Brahman, through the perception of the truth of Atman in\nthis body as a self-luminous entity, then, knowing the Divinity as unborn, eternal and free from all the\nmodifications of Prakriti, he is freed from all sins.\nII-16: This Divinity pervades all directions in their entirety. He is the first-born (Hiranyagarbha). He\nhas entered into the womb. He alone is born, and is to be born in future. He is inside all persons as the\nIndwelling Self, facing all directions.\nII-17: Salutations to that Divinity who is in the fire, who is in the water, who is in the plants, who is in\nthe trees, who has pervaded the whole universe.\nIII-1: It is the self-same One who exists alone at the time of creation and dissolution of the universe,\nthat assumes manifold powers and appears as the Divine Lord by virtue of His inscrutable power of\nMaya. He it is that protects all the worlds and controls all the various forces working therein. Those\nwho realize this Being becomes immortal.\nIII-2: He who protects and controls the worlds by His own powers, He \u2013 Rudra \u2013 is indeed one only.\nThere is no one beside Him who can make Him the second. O men, He is present inside the hearts of\nall beings. After projecting and maintaining all the worlds, He finally withdraws them into Himself.\nIII-3: Though God, the creator of heaven and earth, is one only, yet Heaven is the real owner of all the\neyes, faces, hands and feet in this universe. It is Heaven who inspires them all to do their respective\nduties in accordance with the knowledge, past actions and tendencies of the various beings (with whom\nthey appear to be associated).\nIII-4: May Heaven, who created the gods and supports them; who is the origin also of the cosmic soul;\nwho confers bliss and wisdom on the devotes, destroying their sins and sorrows, and punishing all\nbreaches of law \u2013 may Heaven, the great seer and the lord of all, endow us with good thoughts.\nIII-5: O Lord, who blesses all creatures by revealing the Vedas, deign to make us happy by Thy calm\nand blissful self, which roots out terror as well as sin.\nIII-6: O revealer of the Vedic truths, deign to make propitious that arrow which Thou holdest in Thy\nhand for shooting at somebody. O protector of devotees, do not destroy that benign personal form of\nThine which has manifested as the universe.\nIII-7: Higher than this Personal Brahman is the infinite Supreme Brahman, who is concealed in all\n\nbeings according to their bodies, and who, though remaining single, envelops the whole universe.\nKnowing him to be the Lord, one becomes immortal.\nIII-8: I have realized this Great Being who shines effulgent like the sun beyond all darkness. One\npasses beyond death only on realizing Him. There is no other way of escape from the circle of births\nand deaths.\nIII-9: There is naught higher than or different from Him; naught greater or more minute than Him.\nRooted in His own glory He stands like a tree, one without a second and immovable. By that Being the\nwhole universe is filled.\nIII-10: That Being is far beyond this world, is formless and free from misery. They who know this\nbecome immortal. But all others have indeed to suffer misery alone.\nIII-11: Therefore, that Divine Lord, being all-pervading, omnipresent and benevolent, dwells in the\nhearts of all beings, and makes use of all faces, heads and necks in this world.\nIII-12: This Self is indeed the mighty Lord. He is the imperishable (internal) light that controls\neverything. He guides the intellect of all beings so as to enable them to gain that extremely pure state\n(of Mukti).\nIII-13: Assuming a form of the size of a thumb, by virtue of intellect, emotion, imagination and will,\nthe Infinite Being dwells in the hearts of creatures as their inner self. Those who realize this become\nimmortal.\nIII-14: That Infinite Being has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes and a thousand feet enveloping the\nwhole universe on all sides. He exists beyond ten fingers.\nIII-15: That which is, that which was, and that which is yet to be \u2013 all this is nothing but this Infinite\nBeing. Though He grows beyond His own nature into the form of the objective universe, He still\nremains the lord of immortality.\nIII-16: With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears\neverywhere, That exists, pervading everything in the universe.\nIII-17: They realize Him as shining by the functions of all the senses yet without the senses as the lord\nof all, the ruler of all, the refuge of all and the friend of all.\nIII-18: It is He who resides in the body, the city of nine gates. He is the soul that sports in the outside\nworld. He is the master of the whole world, animate and inanimate.\nIII-19: Without hands and feet He goes fast and grasps; without eyes He sees; without ears He hears.\nHe knows whatever is to be known, yet there is none who knows Him. They say He is the foremost, the\ngreat Infinite Being.\nIII-20: Subtler than even the subtlest and greater than the greatest, the Atman is concealed in the heart\nof the creature. By the grace of the Creator, one becomes free from sorrows and desires, and then\nrealizes Him as the great Lord.\nIII-21: I know this undecaying primeval Immanent Self of all, who is omnipresent because of His allpervasiveness, and whom the expounders of Brahman declare to be eternally free from birth.\nIV-1: May that Divine Being, who, though Himself colourless, gives rise to various colours in different\nways with the help of His own power, for His own inscrutable purpose, and who dissolves the whole\nworld in Himself in the end \u2013 may He endow us with good thoughts !\nIV-2: That Itself is the fire, That is the sun, That is the air, That is the moon, That is also the starry\nfirmament, That is the Brahman, That is the waters, That is Prajapati.\nIV-3: Thou art the woman, Thou art the man, Thou art the youth and the maiden too. Thou art the old\nman who totters along, leaning on the staff. Thou art born with faces turned in all directions.\nIV-4: Thou art the dark blue butterfly, and the green parrot with red eyes. Thou art the thunder-cloud,\nthe seasons and the oceans. Thou art without beginning, and beyond all time and space. Thou art He\nfrom whom all the worlds are born.\nIV-5: There is a single Female of red, white and black colours, who is unoriginated, and who produces\n\nnumerous offsprings resembling herself. By her side lies one unborn Male out of attachment for her,\nwhile another Male, also unoriginated, forsakes her after having enjoyed her.\nIV-6: Two birds of beautiful plumage, who are inseparable friends, reside on the self-same tree. Of\nthese, one eats the fruits of the tree with relish while the other looks on without eating.\nIV-7: Sitting on the same tree the individual soul gets entangled and feels miserable, being deluded on\naccount of his forgetting his divine nature. When he sees the other, the Lord of all, whom all devotees\nworship, and realizes that all greatness is His, then he is relieved of his misery.\nIV-8: Of what avail are the Vedas to him who does not know that indestructible, highest Ethereal Being,\nin whom the gods and the Vedas reside ? Only those who know That are satisfied.\nIV-9: The Lord of Maya projects the Vedas, sacrifices, spiritual practices, past and future, religious\nobservances, all that the Vedas declare, and the whole world including ourselves. The other, again, is\nbound by Maya in this.\nIV-10: Know then that Nature is Maya, and that the great God is the Lord of Maya. The whole world is\nfilled with beings who form His parts.\nIV-11: One attains infinite peace on realizing that self-effulgent Adorable Lord, the bestower of\nblessings, who, though one, presides over all the various aspects of Prajapati, and in whom this\nuniverse dissolves, and in whom it appears in manifold forms.\nIV-12: May He, who created the gods and supports them; who witnessed the birth of the cosmic soul;\nwho confers bliss and wisdom on the devoted, destroying their sins and sorrows, and punishing all\nbreaches of law \u2013 may He, the great seer and the lord of all, endow us with good thoughts !\nIV-13: Let us offer our worship with oblations to that blissful Divine Being who is the lord of the\nDevas, who governs the bipeds and the quadrupeds and in whom the worlds rest.\nIV-14: One attains infinite peace when one realizes that Blissful One who is subtler than the subtlest,\nwho creates the world in the midst of chaos, who assumes various forms, and who is the only one that\nencompasses the universe.\nIV-15: He alone is the protector of the world at the proper time. He is the lord of the universe hidden in\nall creatures. In Him the divine sages and the gods merge themselves. Realizing Him thus, one cuts\nasunder the fetters of death.\nIV-16: One is released from all fetters on realizing the Blissful One who encompasses the world, and\nwho hides Himself in all beings in an extremely subtle form as the essence finer than ghee.\nIV-17: This Divinity, who created the universe and who pervades everything, always dwells in the\nhearts of creatures, being finitized by emotions, intellect, will and imagination. Those who realize this\nbecome immortal.\nIV-18: When ignorance is dispelled, there is neither day nor night, neither being nor non-being. There\nis only that Auspicious One who is imperishable, and who is worthy of being adored by the creator.\nFrom Him has proceeded the ancient wisdom.\nIV-19: No one can grasp Him above, or across, or in the middle. There is none equal to Him whose\nname is great glory.\nIV-20: His form does not stand within the range of the senses. No one perceives Him with the eye.\nThose who know Him through the faculty of intuition as thus seated in their heart, become immortal.\nIV-21: Some, being afraid, approach Thee, thinking that Thou art the unborn. O Rudra, deign to protect\nme with that benevolent face of Thine.\nIV-22: Injure us not in respect of children, grand-children and life, nor in respect of cows and horses.\nDo not destroy our heroes in Thy anger, O Rudra. We invoke Thee always with offerings.\nV-1: Ignorance leads to the perishable. Wisdom leads to immortality. Entirely different from these is he,\nthe imperishable, infinite, secret, Supreme Brahman, in whom exists wisdom as well as ignorance, and\nwho governs them both.\nV-2: He alone presides over Nature in all aspect, and controls every form and every cause of\n\nproduction. He witnesses the birth of the first born seer of golden colour and nourishes him with\nwisdom.\nV-3: Differentiating each genus into its species, and each species into its members, the Supreme Being\nwithdraws them once more into their own ground. Again, bringing forth the agents of creation, the\nGreat Self holds sway over them all.\nV-4: Just as the sun shines lighting up all space above, below and across, even so does that one\nadorable God, the repository of all goodness and greatness, preside over everything that has the nature\nof a cause.\nV-5: He who is the one source of the world brings out everything out of His own Nature, and leads\ncreatures to perfection according to their deserts, and endows each being with its distinguishing\ncharacteristic. Thus he presides over the whole universe.\nV-6: He lies hidden in the Upanishads, which form the essence of the Vedas. Him the Hiranyagarbha\nknows as the source of Himself and the Vedas. Those gods and seers who realized Him in former days\nbecame identified with Him, and verily became immortal.\nV-7: Only he who gets attached to the pleasurable qualities of things does work for the sake of its fruits,\nand enjoys the fruits of his own deeds. Though really the master of the senses, he becomes bound by\nthe three Gunas, and assuming various forms, wanders about through the three paths as a result of his\nown deeds.\nV-8: Subtle as the point of a goad, and pure, effulgent and infinite like the sun, He alone is seen\nassuming as another the size of a thumb on account of the finiteness of the heart (in which He appears),\nand associating Himself with egoism and Sankalpa on account of the limitations of the intellect.\nV-9:That individual soul is as subtle as a hairpoint divided and sub-divided hundreds of times. Yet he is\npotentially infinite. He has to be known.\nV-10: He is neither female, nor male, nor neuter. Whatever body he assumes, he becomes identified\nwith that.\nV-11: By desire, contact, sight and delusion, the embodied soul assumes successively various forms in\nvarious places according to his deeds, just as the body grows nourished by showers of food and drink.\nV-12: The embodied self chooses many forms, gross and subtle, based on the qualities belonging to\nhimself, to the actions, and to the mind. The cause of their combination is found to be still another.\nV-13: Realizing Him who is without beginning or end, who creates the cosmos in the midst of chaos,\nwho assumes many forms, and who alone envelops everything, one becomes free from all fetters.\nV-14: That Supreme Divinity who created both Life and Matter, who is the source of all arts and\nsciences, who can be intuited by a pure and devoted mind \u2013 realizing Him, the blissful the incorporeal\nand the nameless, one is freed from further embodiment.\nVI-1: Some deluded thinkers speak of Nature, and others of time, as the force that revolves this wheel\nof Brahman. But really all this is only the glory of God manifested in the world.\nVI-2: It should be known that energy assumes various forms such as earth, water, light, air and ether at\nthe command of Him who is the master of Gunas and the maker of time, who is omniscient, who is\nPure consciousness itself, and by whom all this is ever enveloped.\nVI-3: After setting the creation in motion and withdrawing Himself from it, He unites the principle of\nSpirit with the principle of Matter \u2013 with one, with two, with three and with eight \u2013 through the mere\ninstrumentality of time and their own inherent properties.\nVI-4: He gives the start to the creation associated with the three Gunas of Nature, and others all things.\nAgain, in the absence of the Gunas, He destroys all created objects, and after destruction, remains aloof\nin His essence.\nVI-5: By previously meditating as seated in one\u2019s own heart, on that Adorable Being who appears as\nthe universe, and who is the true source of all creatures, He can be perceived even though He is the\nprimeval cause of the union (of Spirit with Matter), as well as the partless entity transcending the three\n\ndivisions of time.\nVI-6: Knowing Him who is the origin and dissolution of the universe \u2013 the source of all virtue, the\ndestroyer of all sins, the master of all good qualities, the immortal, and the abode of the universe \u2013 as\nseated in one\u2019s own self, He is perceived as different from, and transcending, the tree of Samsara as\nwell as time and form.\nVI-7: May we realize Him \u2013 the transcendent and adorable master of the universe \u2013 who is the supreme\nlord over all the lords, the supreme God above all the gods, and the supreme ruler over all the rulers.\nVI-8: His has nothing to achieve for Himself, nor has He any organ of action. No one is seen equal or\nsuperior to Him. His great power alone is described in the Vedas to be of various kinds, and His\nknowledge, strength and action are described as inherent in Him.\nVI-9: No one in the world is His master, nor has anybody any control over Him. There is no sign by\nwhich He can be inferred. He is the cause of all, and the ruler of individual souls. He has no parent, nor\nis there any one who is His lord.\nVI-10: May the Supreme Being, who spontaneously covers Himself with the products of Nature, just as\na spider does with the threads drawn from its own navel, grant us absorption in Brahman !\nVI-11: God, who is one only, is hidden in all beings. He is all-pervading, and is the inner self of all\ncreatures. He presides over all actions, and all beings reside in Him. He is the witness, and He is the\nPure Consciousness free from the three Gunas of Nature.\nVI-12: Those wise men, who ever feel in their own hearts the presence of Him who is the one ruler of\nthe inactive many, and who makes the one seed manifold \u2013 to them belongs eternal happiness, and to\nnone else.\nVI-13: He is the eternal among the eternal and the intelligent among all that are intelligent. Though\none, He grants the desires of the many. One is released from all fetters on realizing Him, the cause of\nall, who is comprehensible through philosophy and religious discipline.\nVI-14: The sun does not shine there; neither the moon, nor the stars. There these lightnings shine not \u2013\nhow then this fire ? Because He shines, everything shines after Him. By His light all this shines.\nVI-15: The one destroyer of ignorance in the midst of this universe, He alone is the fire which is\nstationed in water. Realizing Him alone one overcomes death. There is no other path for emancipation.\nVI-16: He is the creator of everything as well as the knower of everything. He is His own source, He is\nall-knowing, and He is the destroyer of time. He is the repository of all good qualities, and the master\nof all sciences. He is the controller of Matter and Spirit, and the lord of the Gunas. He is the cause of\nliberation from the cycle of birth and death, and of bondage which results in its continuance.\nVI-17: He is the soul of the universe, He is immortal, and His is the rulership. He is the all knowing,\nthe all-pervading, the protector of the universe, the eternal ruler. None else is there efficient to govern\nthe world eternally.\nVI-18-19: He who at the beginning of creation projected Brahma (Universal Consciousness), who\ndelivered the Vedas unto him, who constitutes the supreme bridge of immortality, who is the partless,\nfree from actions, tranquil, faultless, taintless and resembles the fire that has consumed its fuel \u2013\nseeking liberation I go for refuge to that Effulgent One, whose light turns the understanding towards\nthe Atman.\nVI-20: Only when men shall roll up the sky like a skin, will there be an end of misery for them without\nrealizing God.\nVI-21: Himself realizing Brahman by the power of self-control and concentration of mind, as well as\nby the grace of God, the sage Svetasvatara expounded well to the highest order of Sannyasins, the truth\nof that supremely holy Brahman resorted to by all the seers.\nVI-22: This highest mysticism, expounded in the Vedanta in a former age, should not be taught to one\nwhose passions have not been subdued, nor to one who is not a worthy son, nor to an unworthy\ndisciple.\nVI-23: These truths, when taught, shine forth only in that high-souled one who has supreme devotion to\n\nGod, and an equal degree of devotion to the spiritual teacher. They shine forth in that high-souled one\nonly.\nOm ! May Brahman protect us both together.\nMay He nourish us both together.\nMay we both work together, with great energy.\nMay our study be vigorous and effective.\nMay we not hate each other.\nOm! Peace! Peace! Peace!\nHere ends the Svetasvataropanishad, included in the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Hamsa": "\nHamsa Upanishad\nTranslated by K. Narayanasvami Aiyar\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. Gautama addressed Sanatkumara thus: \u201cO Lord, thou art the knower of all Dharmas and art well\nversed in all Shastras, pray tell me the means by which I may obtain a knowledge of Brahma-Vidya.\n2. Sanatkumara replied thus: \u201cHear, O Gautama, that Tattva as expounded by Parvati after inquiring\ninto all Dharmas and ascertaining Shiva\u2019s opinion.\n3. This treatise on the nature of Hamsa which gives the fruit of bliss and salvation and which is like a\ntreasure to the Yogin, is (a) very mystic (science) and should not be revealed (to the public).\n4. Now we shall explain the true nature of Hamsa and Paramahamsa for the benefit of a Brahmacharin\n(a seeker after Brahman or celibate), who has his desires under control, is devoted to his guru and\nalways contemplates (as) Hamsa and realise thus: It (Hamsa) is permeating all bodies like fire (or heat)\nin all kinds of wood or oil in all kinds of gingelly seeds. Having known (It) thus, one does not meet\nwith death.\nHaving contracted the anus (with the heels pressed against it), having raised the Vayu (breath) from\n(Mula) Adhara (Chakra), having made circuit thrice round Svadhisthana, having gone to Manipuraka,\nhaving crossed Anahata, having controlled Prana in Visuddhi and then having reached Ajna, one\ncontemplates in Brahmarandhra (in the head) and having meditated there always \u2018I am of three Matras\u2019,\ncognises (his Self) and becomes formless. The Sisna (penis) has two sides (left and right from head to\nfoot). This is that Paramahamsa (Supreme Hamsa or Higher Self) having the resplendence of Crores of\nsuns and by whom all this world is pervaded.\nIf (this Hamsa which has Buddhi as vehicle) has eight-fold Vritti. (When it is) in the eastern petal, there\nis the inclination (in a person) to virtuous actions; in the south-eastern petal, there arise sleep, laziness,\n\netc., in the southern, there is the inclination to cruelty; in the south-western, there is the inclination to\nsins; in the western, there is the inclination to sensual sport; in the north-western, there arise the desire\nof walking and others; in the northern, there arises the desire of lust; in the north-eastern, there arises\nthe desire of amassing money; in the middle (or the inter-spaces between the petals), there is the\nindifference to material pleasures. In the filament (of the lotus), there arises the waking state; in the\npericarp there arises the Svapna (dreaming state); in the Bija (seed of pericarp), there arises the\nSushupti (dreamless sleeping state); when leaving the lotus, there is the Turya (fourth state). When\nHamsa is absorbed in Nada (spiritual sound), the state beyond the fourth is reached. Nada (which is at\nthe end of sound and beyond speech and mind) is like a pure crystal extending from (Mula) Adhara to\nBrahmarandhra. It is that which is spoken of as Brahma and Paramatman.\n(Here is the performance of Ajapa Gayatri is given): Now Hamsa is the Rishi; the metre is Avyakta\nGayatri; Paramahamsa is the Devata (or presiding deity) \u2018Ham\u2019 is the Bija; \u2018Sa\u2019 is the Sakti; So\u2019ham is\nthe Kilaka (wedge). Thus there are six. There are 21,600 Hamsas (or breaths) in a day and night.\n(Salutation to) Surya, Soma, Niranjana (the stainless) and Nirabhasa (the universeless). Ajapa mantra.\n(May) the bodiless and subtle one guide (or illuminate my understanding). Vaushat to Agni-Soma. Then\nAnganyasas and Karanyasas occur (or should be performed after the Mantras as they are performed\nbefore the Mantras) in the heart and other (seats). Having done so, one should contemplate upon Hamsa\nas the Atman in his heart. Agni and Soma are its wings (right and left sides); Omkara is its head; Ukara\nand Bindu are the three eyes and face respectively; Rudra and Rudrani (or Rudra\u2019s wife) are the feet\nKanthata (or the realisation of the oneness of Jivatma or Hamsa, the lower self with Paramatman or\nParamahamsa, the Higher Self) is done in two ways (Samprajnata and Asamprajnata).\nAfter that, Unmani is the end of the Ajapa (Mantra). Having thus reflected upon Manas by means of\nThis (Hamsa), one hears Nada after the uttering of this Japa (Mantra) a crore of times. It (Nada) is\n(begun to be heard as) of ten kinds. The first is Chini (like the sound of that word); the second is ChiniChini; the third is the sound of bell; the fourth is that of conch; the fifth is that of Tantiri (lute); the sixth\nis that sound of Tala (cymbals); the seventh is that of flute; the eighth is that of Bheri (drum); the ninth\nis that of Mridanga (double drum); and the tenth is that of clouds (viz., thunder). He may experience\nthe tenth without the first nine sounds (through the initiation of a Guru). In the first stage, his body\nbecomes Chini-Chini; in the second, there is the (Bhanjana) breaking (or affecting) in the body; in the\nthird, there is the (Bhedana) piercing; in the fourth, the head shakes; in the fifth, the palate produces\nsaliva; in the sixth, nectar is attained; in the seventh, the knowledge of the hidden (things in the world)\narises; in the eighth, Para-Vak is heard; in the ninth, the body becomes invisible and the pure divine eye\nis developed; in the tenth, he attains Para-Brahman in the presence of (or with) Atman which is\nBrahman. After that, when Manas destroyed, when it which is the source of Sankalpa and Vikalpa\ndisappears, owing to the destruction of these two, and when virtues and sins are burnt away, then he\nshines as Sadashiva of the nature of Sakti pervading everywhere, being effulgence in its very essence,\nthe immaculate, the eternal, the stainless and the most quiescent Om. Thus is the teaching of the Vedas;\nand thus is the Upanishad.\u201d\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Hamsa Upanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Aruni": "\nAruni Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Madhavananda\nPublished by Advaita Ashram, Kolkatta\nOm ! Let my limbs and speech, Prana, eyes, ears, vitality\nAnd all the senses grow in strength.\nAll existence is the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nMay I never deny Brahman, nor Brahman deny me.\nLet there be no denial at all:\nLet there be no denial at least from me.\nMay the virtues that are proclaimed in the Upanishads be in me,\nWho am devoted to the Atman; may they reside in me.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. Om. Aruna\u2019s son went to the sphere of Brahma, the Creator, and reaching there said, \u201cLord, in what\nway can I relinquish work altogether ?\u201d Brahma said to him: You must give up your sons, brothers,\nfriends, and the rest, your hair-tuft and the holy thread, your sacrifices and books regulating them, your\nscriptures; must give up the (seven upper) spheres entitled Bhur, Bhuvar, Svar, Mahar, Jana, Tapas, and\nSatya, and the (seven nether) spheres, viz., Atala, Patala, Vitala, Sutala, Rasatala, Talatala and\nMahatala, together with the (whole) universe; and must take on the staff and the scanty clothing of the\nSannyasin; you must renounce everything else, aye, everything else.\n2. The householder, or the Brahmachari, or the Vanaprashta should commit the fires that lead to the\ndifferent spheres to the fire that is in the stomach, and consign the sacred Mantra, Gayatri, to the fire\nthat is in his own speech, should throw the holy thread on the ground or into water. The Kutichara\nliving a Brahmachari\u2019s life should give up his relatives, and discard his begging bowl, and the\nstraining-cloth, should give up his triple staves, and the fires that lead to particular spheres. (So said\nPrajapati). Henceforward he should behave like one who has got no Mantra to repeat, should give up\nthe desire to go to the higher spheres, bathe at the beginning of the three meeting-points of the day, viz.,\nmorning, noon, and evening, should effect a union with his Atman through the highest concentration,\n\nand from amongst the (whole range of the) Vedas should repeat only the Aranyakas, only the\nUpanishads, aye, nothing but the Upanishads.\n3. Verily I am Brahman, the Sutra; the Sutra is Brahman for It originates (the cosmos); I myself am the\nsutra because I am a man of realisation \u2013 the wise one who has realised this should give up his triple\nholy thread. \u201cI have renounced, I have renounced, I have renounced\u201d \u2013 uttering this thrice he should\ndeclare \u2013 \u201cFrom me there is no fear (in word, thought, or deed) to any being, for from me everything\nhas proceeded\u201d. Uttering the Mantra \u2013 \u201cThat art my friend, so protect me (from cows, serpents, etc.),\nthou art strength and my friend, in all seen and unseen danger thou art the Thunder of the Lord of the\nUniverse\u201d, etc., he should hold up high the bamboo staff and put on the loin-cloth. He should take food\nas if it were medicine, aye, as if it were medicine. Carefully guard (oh, ye all who are concerned) your\nchastity (in thought, word and deed), non-injury, non-acceptance of (superfluous) gifts, non-thieving\nand truthfulness \u2013 guard them by all means, aye, do guard !\n4. Now then the duties of the highest class of itinerant monks \u2013 the Paramahamsa Parivrajakas (are as\nfollows): They must sit and lie down on the ground. Those having already taken the vow of chastity\netc., should use an earthen bowl or one made of gourd, or a wooden bowl; they should give up lust\nanger, avarice, infatuation, ostentation, haughtiness, jealousy, attachment to objects, egotism, falsehood\nand the like. The Sannyasin should stay at one place during the four months of the rainy season and\nduring the remaining eight months wander alone, or with a single companion, aye, a single companion.\n5. Verily one who has realised the (true) import of the Vedas may give up those things (previously\nenumerated) after the investiture with the holy thread, or he may do so even before that ceremony \u2013\n(give up) his father, son, his sacrificial fires, and the holy thread, his works, his wife and all else that he\nmay possess. Sannyasins enter a village for begging purposes only, with their palms or their stomach as\nthe receptacle for food. Uttering \u201cOm\u201d \u201cOm\u201d \u201cOm\u201d, they should mentally place this Mantra, the\nUpanishad, in the different parts of their body. He who realises the Truth in this manner is really the\nwise one. He who knows this (and is a Brahmachari taking on the monastic vow) should give up the\nstaff made of the wood of the Palasha (Dhak), Bilva (Marmelos), or Audumbara (Fig) trees, his skin\nand girdle and the holy thread, etc., and thus be a hero. \u201cThat supreme state of the all-pervading Deity\nthe sages realise for all time like the eye pervading from one end of the sky to the other.\u201d \u201cSages\npurged of all impurities like anger etc., who have awakened from the sleep (of ignorance), kindle that\nTruth (in the minds of the enquirers), that supreme state of the all-pervading Deity.\u201d Such indeed is the\ninjunction of the scriptures leading to liberation \u2013 the injunction of the Vedas, aye, of the Vedas.\nOm ! Let my limbs and speech, Prana, eyes, ears, vitality\nAnd all the senses grow in strength.\nAll existence is the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nMay I never deny Brahman, nor Brahman deny me.\nLet there be no denial at all:\nLet there be no denial at least from me.\nMay the virtues that are proclaimed in the Upanishads be in me,\nWho am devoted to the Atman; may they reside in me.\nOm !

    "Garbha": "\nGarbha Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nThe body is fivefold in nature (the five elements), existing in the five, depending on the six (tastes of\nfood), connected with the six qualities (kama etc.,), seven Dhatus, three impurities, three Yonis (of\nexcretion) and four kinds of food.\nWhy say \u2018Fivefold in nature ?\u2019 The five elements Earth, Water, Fire, Wind and Ether. In this body,\nwhatever is hard is of Earth, liquid is water, warm is fire, whatever moves about is air and spaceenclosed is ether. The function of the Earth is to support, water is to consolidate (digestion etc.,). Fire is\nto see, wind is for moving, Ether is to give space (for vital functions).\nThe eyes are used in seeing form, ears for sound, tongue for taste, the skin and nose for touch and smell\nrespectively; genital for pleasure, Apana is for evacuation (of bowels). The person cognises through the\nintellect, wills with the mind and speaks with the tongue.\nThe six-fold support is the six tastes (of food): sweet, acid, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent.\n1-7. Sadja, Risabha, Gandhara, Panchama, Madhyama, Dhaivata, Nisadha \u2013 these are the seven\nagreeable and disagreeable sounds. White, Red, Black smoke-coloured, Yellow, Tawny and Pale-White\n\u2013 these are the colours of the seven Dhatus (primary Humours). Why ? For Devadatta (any person)\nthere springs up in his mind desire for enjoyment of objects. From relish of food blood is born, from it\nis flesh, thence fat, bones, marrow, semen; by the combination of semen and blood the foetus is born.\nVital warmth springs up in the womb and the belly. In the seat of the warmth bile, Prana flows \u2013 at the\nproper season ordained by the creator.\n8. The embryo lying (in the womb) for (a day) and night is a confused mass; after seven days it\n\nbecomes a bubble; after a fortnight, a mass and in a month, it hardens. In two months develops the\nregion of the head; in three months, the feet; in the fourth, belly and hip; in the fifth, the backbone; in\nthe sixth, nose, eyes and ears; in the seventh the embryo quickens with life and in the eighth month, it\nbecomes complete.\n9. By the dominance of the father\u2019s semen, the child becomes male; the mother\u2019s \u2013 female. When\nequal, a eunuch. If, at the time of impregnation, the parents are agitated, the child will be blind,\ncrippled, hunch-backed or stunted in growth. If the couple have vital-air-trouble, the semen enters in\ntwo parts resulting in twins.\n10. In the eighth month, in conjunction with the five vital airs the Jiva gets the capacity to know its past\naffairs (of past births), conceives of the imperishable Atman as Om, through perfect knowledge and\nmeditation. Having known Om he sees in the body the eight Prakritis derived from it the five elements,\nmind, intellect and ego and the sixteen changes [see Prasnopanishad].\n11. The body becomes complete in the ninth month and remembers the past birth. Actions done and not\ndone flash to him and he recognises the good and bad nature of Karma.\n12-17. \u2018I have seen thousands of wombs, eaten several kinds of food and sucked many breasts; born\nand dead often, I am immersed in grief but see no remedy. If I can get out of this, I will resort to\nSankhya-Yoga which destroys misery and yields liberation; or I resort to Maheshvara who destroys\nmisery. Or I resort to Narayana, who destroys misery. If I did good and bad deeds for the sake of my\ndependants, I shall myself be burnt for the deeds \u2013 the others who enjoyed the fruits go away\n(unaffected).\n18. The person being squeezed as it were by a machine is touched by all-pervading air and forgets\nprevious births and deeds.\n19. Why is the body so called ? It has three fires: the Kosthagni ripens all that is eaten; the Darsanagni\nhelps one see colour etc., the Jnanagni is the mind which helps perform good and bad deeds.\n20. The Daksinagni is in the heart; Garhapatya in the belly and Ahavaniya in the mouth; the intellect is\nthe performer\u2019s consort, contentment is Diksha, sense organs are the utensils, head is the jar, hair is the\nsacred grass, the mouth the interior of the altar etc.\n21. The heart measures 8 Palas, tongue 12, bile is one Prastha, phlegm one Adhaka.

He, who tells these eight letters, attains full life without any blemish. He would\nattain salvation after becoming the lord of the people and be blessed with lots of wealth, lots of cows\nand all other forms of wealth.

That pranava (Brahma Purusha) growing in several ways becomes \u201cOm\u201d and that\nyogi (student of yoga) who meditates on it attains salvation. That yogi who meditates on \u201cOm Namo\nNarayanaya\u201d reaches Vaikunta, the abode of Lord Vishnu. That Vaikunta is nothing but the Hrudaya\nKamala (lotus like heart) which is full of eternal wisdom from which a streak of light similar to\nlightning emanates. The son of Devaki is Brahmam. The Madhu Sudhana (he who killed Madhu) is\nBrahmam. The lotus eyed one is Brahmam and also Lord Vishnu who is Achyutha. That Purusha which\nis the reason for existence of all beings is surely Narayana. He is also the causeless \u201cOm\u201d, which is\nPara Brahmam.

    "Paramahamsa": "[Publisher's Note: This Narayana Upanishad is listed as one of the 108 Upanishads in another version\nof Muktika Upanishad. The Upanishad \"Narayana\" listed in our version of Muktika Upanishad\nactually means Maha Narayana Upanishad.]\n\nParamahamsa Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Madhavananda\nPublished by Advaita Ashram, Kolkatta\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\n1. \u201cWhat is the path of the Paramahamsa Yogis, and what are their duties ?\u201d \u2013 was the question Narada\nasked on approaching the Lord Brahma (the Creator). To him the Lord replied: The path of the\nParamahamsas that you ask of is accessible with the greatest difficulty by people; they have not many\nexponents, and it is enough if there be one such. Verily, such a one rests in the ever-pure Brahman; he is\nverily the Brahman inculcated in the Vedas \u2013 this is what the knowers of Truth hold; he is the great one,\nfor he rests his whole mind always in Me; and I, too, for that reason, reside in him. Having renounced\nhis sons, friends, wife, and relations, etc., and having done away with the Shikha, the holy thread, the\nstudy of the Vedas, and all works, as well as this universe, he should use the Kaupina, the staff, and just\nenough clothes, etc., for the bare maintenance of his body, and for the good of all. And that is not final.\nIf it is asked what this final is, it is as follows:\n2. The Paramahamsa carries neither the staff, nor the hair-tuft, nor the holy thread nor any covering. He\nfeels neither cold, nor heat, neither happiness nor misery, neither honour, nor contempt etc. It is meet\nthat he should be beyond the reach of the six billows of this world-ocean. Having given up all thought\nof calumny, conceit, jealousy, ostentation, arrogance, attachment or antipathy to objects, joy and\nsorrow, lust, anger, covetousness, self-delusion, elation, envy, egoism, and the like, he regards his body\nas a corpse, as he has thoroughly destroyed the body-idea. Being eternally free from the cause of doubt,\nand of misconceived and false knowledge, realising the Eternal Brahman, he lives in that himself, with\nthe consciousness \u201cI myself am He, I am That which is ever calm, immutable, undivided, of the essence\nof knowledge-bliss, That alone is my real nature.\u201d That (Jnana) alone is his Shikha. That (Jnana) alone\nis his holy thread. Through the knowledge of the unity of the Jivatman with the Paramatman, the\ndistinction between them is wholly gone too. This (unification) is his Sandhya ceremony.\n\n3. He who relinquishing all desires has his supreme rest in the One without a second, and who holds the\nstaff of knowledge, is the true Ekadandi. He who carries a mere wooden staff, who takes to all sorts of\nsense-objects, and is devoid of Jnana, goes to horrible hells known as the Maharauravas. Knowing the\ndistinction between these two, he becomes a Paramahamsa.\n4. The quarters are his clothing, he prostrates himself before none, he offers no oblation to the Pitris\n(manes), blames none, praises none \u2013 the Sannyasin is ever of independent will. For him there is no\ninvocation to God, no valedictory ceremony to him; no Mantra, no meditation, no worship; to him is\nneither the phenomenal world nor That which is unknowable; he sees neither duality nor does he\nperceive unity. He sees neither \u201cI\u201d nor \u2018thou\u201d, nor all this. The Sannyasin has no home. He should not\naccept anything made of gold or the like, he should not have a body of disciples, or accept wealth. If it\nbe asked what harm there is in accepting them, (the reply is) yes, there is harm in doing so. Because if\nthe Sannyasin looks at gold with longing, he makes himself a killer of Brahman; because if the\nSannyasin touches gold with longing, he becomes degraded into a Chandala; because if he takes gold\nwith longing, he makes himself a killer of the Atman. Therefore, the Sannyasin must neither look at,\nnor touch nor take gold, with longing. All desires of the mind cease to exist, (and consequently) he is\nnot agitated by grief, and has no longing for happiness; renunciation of attachment to sense-pleasures\ncomes, and he is everywhere unattached in good or evil, (consequently) he neither hates nor is elated.\nThe outgoing tendency of all the sense-organs subsides in him who rests in the Atman alone. Realising\n\u201cI am that Brahman who is the One Infinite Knowledge-Bliss\u201d he reaches the end of his desires, verily\nhe reaches the end of his desires.\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Paramahamsopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Amritabindu": "\nAmrita Bindu Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Madhavananda\nPublished by Advaita Ashram, Kolkatta\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. The mind is chiefly spoken of as of two kinds, pure and impure. The impure mind is that which is\npossessed of desire, and the pure is that which is devoid of desire.\n2. It is indeed the mind that is the cause of men\u2019s bondage and liberation. The mind that is attached to\nsense-objects leads to bondage, while dissociated from sense-objects it tends to lead to liberation. So\nthey think.\n3. Since liberation is predicated of the mind devoid of desire for sense-objects, therefore, the mind\nshould always be made free of such desire, by the seeker after liberation.\n4. When the mind, with its attachment for sense-objects annihilated, is fully controlled within the heart\nand thus realises its own essence, then that Supreme State (is gained).\n5. The mind should be controlled to that extent in which it gets merged in the heart. This is Jnana\n(realisation) and this is Dhyana (meditation) also, all else is argumentation and verbiage.\n6. (The Supreme State) is neither to be thought of (as being something external and pleasing to the\nmind), nor unworthy to be thought of (as something unpleasant to the mind); nor is It to be thought of\n(as being of the form of sense-pleasure), but to be thought of (as the essence of the ever-manifest,\neternal, supreme Bliss Itself); that Brahman which is free from all partiality is attained in that state.\n7. One should duly practise concentration on Om (first) through the means of its letters, then meditate\non Om without regard to its letters. Finally on the realisation with this latter form of meditation on Om,\nthe idea of the non-entity is attained as entity.\n8. That alone is Brahman, without component parts, without doubt and without taint. Realising \u201cI am\n\nthat Brahman\u201d one becomes the immutable Brahman.\n9. (Brahman is) without doubt, endless, beyond reason and analogy, beyond all proofs and causeless\nknowing which the wise one becomes free.\n10. The highest Truth is that (pure consciousness) which realises, \u201cThere is neither control of the mind,\nnor its coming into play\u201d, \u201cNeither am I bound, nor am I a worshipper, neither am I a seeker after\nliberation, nor one-who has attained liberation\u201d.\n11. Verily the Atman should be known as being the same in Its states of wakefulness, dreaming, and\ndreamless sleep. For him who has transcended the three states there is no more rebirth.\n12. Being the one, the universal Soul is present in all beings. Though one, It is seen as many, like the\nmoon in the water.\n13. Just as it is the jar which being removed (from one place to another) changes places and not the\nAkasa enclosed in the jar \u2013 so is the Jiva which resembles the Akasa.\n14. When various forms like the jar are broken again and again the Akasa does not know them to be\nbroken, but He knows perfectly.\n15. Being covered by Maya, which is a mere sound, It does not, through darkness, know the Akasa (the\nBlissful one). When ignorance is rent asunder, It being then Itself only sees the unity.\n16. The Om as Word is (first looked upon as) the Supreme Brahman. After that (word-idea) has\nvanished, that imperishable Brahman (remains). The wise one should meditate on that imperishable\nBrahman, if he desires the peace of his soul.\n17. Two kinds of Vidya ought to be known \u2013 the Word-Brahman and the Supreme Brahman. One\nhaving mastered the Word-Brahman attains to the Highest Brahman.\n18. After studying the Vedas the intelligent one who is solely intent on acquiring knowledge and\nrealisation, should discard the Vedas altogether, as the man who seeks to obtain rice discards the husk.\n19. Of cows which are of diverse colours the milk is of the same colour. (the intelligent one) regards\nJnana as the milk, and the many-branched Vedas as the cows.\n20. Like the butter hidden in milk, the Pure Consciousness resides in every being. That ought to be\nconstantly churned out by the churning rod of the mind.\n21. Taking hold of the rope of knowledge, one should bring out, like fire, the Supreme Brahman. I am\nthat Brahman indivisible, immutable, and calm, thus it is thought of.\n22. In Whom reside all beings, and Who resides in all beings by virtue of His being the giver of grace\nto all \u2013 I am that Soul of the Universe, the Supreme Being, I am that Soul of the Universe, the Supreme\nBeing.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Amritabindupanishad, as contained in the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Amritanada": "\nAmrita-Nada Upanishad\nTranslated by K. Narayanasvami Aiyar\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. The wise, having studied the Shastras and reflected on them again and again and having come to\nknow Brahman, should abandon them all like a fire-brand.\n2-3. Having ascended the car of Om with Vishnu (the Higher Self) as the charioteer, one wishing to go\nto the seat of Brahmaloka intent on the worship of Rudra, should go in the chariot so long as he can go.\nThen abandoning the car, he reaches the place of the Lord of the car.\n4. Having given up Matra, Linga and Pada, he attains the subtle Pada (seat or word) without vowels or\nconsonants by means of the letter \u2018M\u2019 without the Svara (accent).\n5. That is called Pratyahara when one merely thinks of the five objects of sense, such as sound, etc., as\nalso the very unsteady mind as the reins of Atman.\n6. Pratyahara (subjugation of the senses), Dhyana (contemplation), Pranayama (control of breath),\nDharana (concentration), Tarka and Samadhi are said to be the six parts of Yoga.\n7. Just as the impurities of mountain-minerals are burnt by the blower, so the stains committed by the\norgans are burned by checking Prana.\n8. Through Pranayamas should be burnt the stains; through Dharana, the sins; through Pratyahara, the\n(bad) associations; and through Dhyana, the godless qualities.\n9. Having destroyed the sins, one should think of Ruchira (the shining).\n10. Ruchira (cessation), expiration and inspiration \u2013 these three are Pranayama of (Rechaka, Puraka\nand Kumbhaka) expiration, inspiration and cessation of breath.\n11. That is called (one) Pranayama when one repeats with a prolonged (or elongated) breath three times\nthe Gayatri with its Vyahritis and Pranava (before it) along with the Siras (the head) joining after it.\n\n12. Raising up the Vayu from the Akasa (region, viz., the heart) and making the body void (of Vayu)\nand empty and uniting (the soul) to the state of void, is called Rechaka (expiration).\n13. That is called Puraka (inspiration) when one takes in Vayu, as a man would take water into his\nmouth through the lotus-stalk.\n14. That is called Kumbhaka (cessation of breath) when there is no expiration or inspiration and the\nbody is motionless, remaining still in one state.\n15. Then he sees forms like the blind, hears sounds like the deaf and sees the body like wood. This is\nthe characteristic of one that has attained much quiescence.\n16. That is called Dharana when the wise man regards the mind as Sankalpa and merging Sankalpa into\nAtman, contemplates upon his Atman (alone).\n17. That is called Tarka when one makes inference which does not conflict with the Vedas. That is\ncalled Samadhi in which one, on attaining it, thinks (all) equal.\n18-20. Seating himself on the ground on a seat of Kusa grass which is pleasant and devoid of all evils,\nhaving protected himself mentally (from all evil influences), uttering Ratha-Mandala, assuming either\nPadma, Svastika, or Bhadra posture or any other which can be practised easily, facing the north and\nclosing the nostril with the thumb, one should inspire through the other nostril and retain breath inside\nand preserve the Agni (fire). Then he should think of the sound (Om) alone.\n21. Om, the one letter is Brahman; Om should not be breathed out. Through this divine mantra (Om), it\nshould be done many times to rid himself of impurity.\n22. Then as said before, the Mantra-knowing wise should regularly meditate, beginning with the navel\nupwards in the gross, the primary (or less) gross and subtle (states).\n23. The greatly wise should give up all (sight) seeing across, up or down and should practise Yoga\nalways being motionless and without tremor.\n24. The union as stated (done) by remaining without tremor in the hallow stalk (viz., Susumna) alone is\nDharana. The Yoga with the ordained duration of twelve Matras is called (Dharana).\n25. That which never decays is Akshara (Om) which is without Ghosha (third, fourth and fifth letters\nfrom 'K\u2019), consonant, vowel, palatal, guttural, nasal, letter \u2018R\u2019 and sibilants.\n26. Prana travels through (or goes by) that path through which this Akshara (Om) goes. Therefore it\nshould be practised daily, in order to pass along that (course).\n27. It is through the opening (or hole) of the heart, through the opening of Vayu (probably navel),\nthrough the opening of the head and through the opening of Moksha. They call it Bila (cave), Sushira\n(hole), or Mandala (wheel).\n28. (Then about the obstacles of Yoga): A Yogin should always avoid fear, anger, laziness, too much\nsleep or waking and too much food or fasting.\n29. If the above rule be well and strictly practised each day, spiritual wisdom will arise of itself in three\nmonths without doubt.\n30. In four months, he sees the Devas; in five months, he knows (or becomes) Brahma-Nishtha; and\ntruly in six months he attains Kaivalya at will. There is no doubt.\n31. That which is of the earth is of five Matras (or it takes five Matras to pronounce Parthiva-Pranava).\nThat which is of water is of four Matras; of Agni, three Matras; of Vayu, two;\n32. And of Akasa, one. But he should think of that which is with no Matras. Having united Atman with\nManas, one should contemplate upon Atman by means of Atman.\n33. Prana is thirty digits long. Such is the position (of range) of Pranas. That is called Prana which is\nthe seat of the external Pranas.\n34. The breaths by day and night are numbered as 1,13,180 [or 21,600 - ?].\n35. (Of the Pranas) the first viz., Prana is pervading the heart; Apana, the anus; Samana, the navel;\nUdana, the throat;\n36. And Vyana, all parts of the body. Then come the colours of the five Pranas in order.\n37. Prana is said to be of the colour of a blood-red gem (or coral); Apana which is in the middle is of\n\nthe colour of Indragopa (an insect of white or red colour);\n38. Samana is between the colour of pure milk and crystal (or oily and shining), between both (Prana\nand Apana); Udana is Apandara (pale white); and Vyana resembles the colour of archis (or ray of light).\n39. That man is never reborn wherever he may die, whose breath goes out of the head after piercing\nthrough this Mandala (of the pineal gland). That man is never reborn.\nOm !

We humans do not have\nany shortage of that nectar (your grace). 3-2\nYou who are primeval are older than the sun and the moon. 3-3\nFor the sake of this world, this deathless primeval being, catches hold of this world which is created by\nPrajapathi and which is minute and peaceful, without touching it and attracts its shape of things by\nshape, peacefulness by peace, minuteness by minuteness and airy nature by its airy nature and\nswallows it. Salutations and salutations to that great swallower. 3-4\nThose gods who reside in the heart reside in the soul of the heart. And you who live in that heart are\nbeyond the triad nature. [The three letters Aa, Uu and ma or three states viz. wakefulness, sleep and\nstate of dream.] 3-5\nThe head of \u201cthe sound of Om\u201d is on your left side. Its feet are on your right side. That \u201cSound of Om\u201d\nis the Pranava(primeval sound). That Pranava is spread everywhere. That which is everywhere is the\ngreatest. That which is limitless, shines like a white star. That which is also called Shuklam (seminal\nfluid- the basic unit of life) is very very minute. That which is minute is like a lightning power. That\nwhich is like lightning power is the ultimate Brahman. That Brahman is one and only one. That one and\nonly one is Rudra (loosely translated angry one), it is also Eeshana (the form of Lord Shiva with tuft\nand riding on a bull), it is also the ultimate God and it is also the lord of all things. 3-6\nRudra is called the personification of Pranva because he sends the souls towards heaven, at the time of\ndeath (dissolution).\nHe is called the \u201cone who has the shape of Pranava \u201c, because the Brahmins read and propagate the\nRik, Yajur, Sama and Atharva Vedas only after reading \u201com\u201d.\nHe is called \u201call pervading \u201c because like oil in gingili (Til), he peacefully pervades all over the world\nand its beings, from top to bottom and from right to left.\nHe is called \u201cAnantha (endless)\u201d, because his end is neither at the top nor bottom, nor right nor left.\nHe is called \u201cthara (protector)\u201d because he protects one from the fear of life which consists of the fear\nof staying in the womb, fear at time of birth, fear from diseases, fear from old age and fear from death.\nHe is called \u201cShukla (white/ seminal fluid) because by pronouncing his name we get rid of all pains.\nHe is called \u201csookshma (minute)\u201d, because he pervades in a minute form all over the body without\ntouching any of the organs.\nHe is called \u201cvaidhyutha (electric)\u201d because as soon as his name is pronounced , in the state of darkness\n\nwhere nothing is visible, the holy knowledge comes like a ray of lightning.\nHe is called \u201cPara Brahmam (the ultimate reality)\", because though he is inside every thing, he is in\nand out of everything, he is the refuge of every thing and bigger than the big, he is inside every thing.\nHe is called \u201cEka (single)\u201d because he singly destroys everything and recreates everything.\nHe is called \u201ctheertha (sacred water)\u201d because he is the ultimate mingling of all sacred waters which\nare sought after, in the east, south, north ad west.\nHe is \u201cEka (loner)\u201d because he creates all beings and travels within them alone without any one\nrealizing where he comes from and where he goes.\nHe is \u201cRudra\u201d because he is fast moving form is not understood by all but only by great sages and\ndevotees.\nHe is \u201cEeshana\u201d because by his power for creation and upkeep and also because he rules over all devas\n(gods).\nLike approaching a cow for getting milk, we come to you. You are \u201cEeshana\u2019 because Veda points you\nout as one who shows the heaven and one who rules over other Gods.\nYou are also called \u201cMaheswara (great lord)\u201d because you bless your devotees by giving them\nknowledge, because you created words and brought out knowledge, and because you have forsaken\neverything and reached a highest state of existence through yoga and your grace.\nThis is the story of Rudra. 4\nThis god is the one who pervades in all directions. He is the one who came earlier than every thing. He\nis the one who is in the womb. He is the one who is in all the creatures which have come out till now\nand all those who are going to be created in future. He is also the one who sees the inside but the one\nwho has a face which looks outside. 5.1\nRudra is one and only one. There is none second to him. He rules all worlds by his power. He pervades\nfully in all beings. He is the one who, at the time of deluge, absorbs all beings. He is the one who\ncreates all beings and upkeeps them. 5.2\nHe alone exists, in all organs where birth takes place. He travels among all beings and is the reason for\ntheir existence. The seeker would get immeasurable peace by searching and surrendering to this god,\nwho gives everything to the one who asks and who is praiseworthy. 5.3\nHe converts fire, air, water, earth, ether and everything that exists here in to ash. He who sees this and\nmentally realizes it and observes the \u201cpenance to Pasupathi (Lord of all beings)\u201d and who coats ash all\nover his body with this ash attains the state of Brahman. By worshipping \u201cPasupathi (lord of all\nbeings)\u201d like this, the ties of bondage of all beings get cut and they attain salvation. 5.4\nThere is none greater than him, on whom all the worlds are strung like beads. Over ages, nothing so far\nwhere greater than him and nothing is going to be greater than him. He has thousands of legs but one\nand only one head. He pervades every where.\n\nFrom \u201cAkshara (letter/language/ the deathless being)\u201d time is created. From \u201ctime (ages) the \u201call\npervasiveness\u201d is created. This \u201call pervasiveness\" is Rudra. Rudra destroys beings even when he is\nsleeping. From his \u201cbreath\u201d is produced the \u201cpower of Thamas (darkness)\u201d. From Thamas is created\nwater. Mixing this water with finger makes it cold. By mixing the coolness the \u201cfoam\u201d is produced.\nFrom that foam, the galaxy is produced. From the galaxy, Brahmam is produced. From Brahmam, air is\nproduced. From air, \u201cthe sound of Om\u201d is produced. From \u201cthe sound of Om\u201d, Savithri is produced.\nFrom Savithri, Gayathri is produced and from Gayathri, all the worlds are produced. They who worship\n\u201cpenance\u201d and \u201ctruth\u201d, get permanent happiness. Worshipping that Brahmam, which is the mixture of\nlight, water, essence and nectar, by chanting \u201com Bhoor bhuva swarom\u201d is the greatest penance.\nOm !

O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nI meditate on that \u201cultimate truth\u201d, which explains the meaning \u201cof the sound of Om\u201d, which shines as\nthe fourth leg of Om, which is Thureeya of Thureeyas (A super divine state of oneness with God, which\nis beyond the three states of wakefulness, sleep and dream), which enjoys being in three legs (syllables)\nand which is one and only one.\nOm!\nThe sages Pippalada, Aangiras and Sanath Kumara approached the great God like sage, Atharva\nMaharshi and asked him, \u201cOh, God like sage, what is the chief aspect of meditation? What is the\nmantra (holy syllable) on which to meditate? Who can meditate? Who is the God of meditation?\u201d 1.1\nThe sage Atharva replied to them,\u201d Mainly meditation has to be done on the single letter Om. It itself is\nthe mantra for meditation. The four legs of that mantra are the four devas and the four Vedas. The letter\nhas to be recognized as the Para Brahman (Ultimate reality) and meditated upon. 1.2\n\nThe first syllable Aa, indicates earth, the Rig Veda along with its holy chants, Brahma the creator, Ashta\nVasus among devas, \u201cGayathry\u201d among meters, and Garhapthya (the fire of the household) among\nfires. 1.3\nThe second syllable Uu denotes the ether, the Yajur Veda, Rudra who is the God of destruction, the\neleven Rudras among devas, \u201cTrishgup\u201d among meters and dakshinagni (fire of the south - funeral\npyre) among the fires. 1.4\nThe third syllable Ma indicates the heavens, Sama Veda with its musical sounds of Sama, Vishnu who\nlooks after the worlds, the twelve Adithyas (suns) among devas, \u201cjagathichanda\u201d among meters and\nAhavagni (the fire used in fire sacrifice) among the fires. 1.5\nThat half fourth syllable which is the hidden Ma, is the magical chants of Atharva Veda, Samvarthaka\n(the fire of exchange) fire among fires, marud Ganas among devas. It is the self glittering Brahman\nwhich shines alone and sees everything. 1.6\nThe first is the red Brahma (creative aspect) , the second the holy white Rudra (destructive aspect), the\nthird the black Lord Vishnu (the administrative aspect) and the fourth which is like lightning is the\nmulti coloured Purushothama (best among males). 1.7\nThis Omkara has four legs and four heads (fires). The fourth is the half syllable sound of \u201cMa\u201d which is\nhidden. That is pronounced in a small short form, slightly extended form (pluthyaga) and much\nextended form. It is pronounced as Om with one mathra, Om in two mathras and Om in the extended\nthree mathras (mathra is the unit of pronunciation). 1.8\nThe fourth peaceful half syllable is hidden in the long ended pronunciation. It is the incomparable\nglitter of the soul. It is that sound which was never there and which will be never there. If not\npronounced earlier but pronounced for the first time it, takes one via the Sushumna Nadi to the lotus\nwith thousand petals (Sahasrara). 1.9.\nThe pranava (the sound of Om) makes all the souls to bow before it. It is the one and only one which\nhas to be meditated upon as the four Vedas and the birth place of all devas. One who meditates like that\ngoes away from all sorrows and fears and gets the power to protect all others who approach him. It is\nbecause of this meditation only that Lord Vishnu who is spread every where, wins over all others. It is\nbecause Lord Brahma controlled all his organs and meditated upon it, he attained the position of the\ncreator. Even Lord Vishnu , parks his mind in the sound (Om) of the place of Paramathma (ultimate\nsoul) and meditates upon Eeshana, who is most proper to be worshipped. All this is only proper in case\nof Eeshana. 2.1\nBrahma, Vishnu, Rudra and Indra are creating all beings, all organs and all karanas. They are also\ncapable of controlling them. But Lord Shiva exists in between them like sky and is permanently stable.\n2.2\nIt is advised that the five gods Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Ishwara and Shiva should be worshipped in the\nform of pranava [Aa+Uu+Ma+sound+Bindu(full stop)]. 2.3\nEven if for one second, if one can stay and meditate on these, he gets more results than that of\nperforming one hundred fire sacrifices. With the full understanding and knowledge, one should only\nmeditate on paramashiva, which would give rise to all benefits. It is definite that, by sacrificing all\n\nother things, the twice born, should learn and understand this and he would get rid of the suffering of\nliving in the womb and attain salvation. 2.4\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm !

    "Maitrayini": "\nMaitrayani Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm !

Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nPRAPATHAKA ONE\nThe King Brihadratha, setting up his eldest son as king, deeming the body to be impermanent, getting\ndetachment, went to the forest. He performed great penance and stood looking at the sun, arms uplifted.\nAt the end of a thousand years the sage Sakayana approached (him) like, fire without smoke, burning\nwith his lustre and said \u2018Oh King, arise and choose a boon\u2019. He bowed and said, \u2018Sir, I am ignorant of\nthe self. You know it; please impart it\u2019.\n\u2018This has happened in the past, and is impossible, ask for other desires\u2019. But the King touched his feet\nand said, \u2018Sir, what is the use of enjoyment in this body which smells badly and is a mass of bones,\nskins, etc., attacked by lust, anger, etc., separation from near and dear people, hunger, thirst etc. We see\nthat all this is decaying, like flies and mosquitoes which live and die.\nGreat kings Dudyumna, Bhuridyumna, Indradyumna, Kuvalayasva, Yauvanasva etc., of Suryavamsa,\nMarutta etc., of the Somavamsa, relinquished this world and went to the other, even as the relatives\nwere watching. We also see how Gandharvas, Asuras, Yaksas and others are dead and gone. The oceans\nbecome dry, mountains fall, Dhruva star is shaken, trees and earth are uprooted.\nThere is only rebirth in this world after all the enjoyment. You should uplift me who am like a frog in a\n\ndark well. You are my refuge.\nPRAPATHAKA TWO\nThe sage Sakayanya being pleased said, \u2018O King, the flag (ornament) of the Ikshvaku dynasty, you\nknow the self, have done your duty, famous as the son of king Marut. This indeed, is your self\u2019.\n\u2018Which, O Lord\u2019 (he asked). He replied: \u2018It cannot be described. This one, bound by external causes,\ngoing upward, suffering and yet not (really) suffering, dispels ignorance like the sun dispelling\ndarkness. The tranquil one rising from this body and approaching the supreme, manifests itself in its\nown essence, immortal, fearless.\nThis Brahma-vidya has been imparted to us by Lord Maitreya. I shall teach you the same. The sinless,\npowerfully radiant and chaste Valakhilyas spoke to Prajapati, \u2018Lord, this body is inert like a cart. Which\nsubtle being has such greatness that the body is set up as a conscious thing ? Who is the driver of this\nbody ?\u2019\nHe told them \u2018He who is beyond speech, is pure, holy, empty of delusion, placid, breathless,\nindependent, endless, unchangeable, eternal, unborn, free, in his own glory. He is the driver.\nThey said, \u2018How can this body be set up like this by one who is devoid of desire ?\u2019 He replied \u2018The self\nis subtle, non-object, invisible and called Purusha. In part he is consciously present here and awakens\nthe sleeper. That conscious part of this Purusha is the knower of the body in every individual. His\nmarks are imagination, determination and conceit \u2013 he is the Lord of creatures, the eye of all. By that\nconscious being is the body set up. He is the driver.\nThey asked, \u2018Lord, how can such a being exist in part ?\u2019\nHe told them, \u2018This Prajapati was there in the beginning. Being alone he was not happy. He\ncontemplated on himself and made numerous beings. They were unaware of him, breathless, inert like\na post. He was not happy and thought, \u2018To kindle their awareness, I shall enter into them\u2019. Making\nhimself like air, he entered, not as one but making himself five-fold Prana, Apana, Vyana, Udana and\nSamana airs. The breath that moves upward is Prana, Apana moves down. Samana is that which causes\nthe eaten food to settle and circulates it to every limb equally. Udana throws up and sends down the\ndrink and food. That which pervades the nerves is Vyana. The Vaisvanara wind overpowers the\nAntaryami wind and vice versa. In between these two warmth is exuded \u2013 the warmth is the spirit \u2013\nspirit is cosmic fire. Also this has been stated elsewhere. The fire within is the cosmic fire, the inner fire\nby which food is digested. The sound of digestion is heard with closed ears, not when one is about to\ndie.\nThis supreme being dividing himself into five, established in the cave (heart) is all mental, his body is\nthe vital breath. He has many forms, his imaginations are true. Standing in the core of the heart, he\nstrives and thinks: Let me become all things. Uprisen, dividing things by the five rays, he experiences\nthen. The sense organs are the rays, the motor organs are the horses; the body the chariot, mind is the\ndriver, of the nature of Prakriti; driving with the whip, he makes the body revolve like a wheel. Due to\nhim is the body a conscious entity.\nThis self is truly led to depend on the non-self by the fruit of actions, white and dark, is overwhelmed,\nas it were, by them and flits from body to body. Being unmanifest, subtle, invisible, non-object,\nunpossessive, free from states, non-agent, (but) abides like an agent.\nHe is truly pure, steadfast, immutable, untarnished, uneager, desireless, abiding as witness, experiences\n\u2018fruits of actions\u2019, is loved by a sheet (of Prakriti).\nPRAPATHAKA THREE\nThey said, \u2018O Lord, who then is the other self, overwhelmed by the white and dark fruits of actions and\ngoes to wombs, good and bad, who goes down or up wandering, overcome by dualities ?\u2019\nHe replied: There is indeed another self in elements, overwhelmed by actions white and dark. Elements\nmeans the five root-elements as well as the five concrete elements. Their complex is the body.\n\nThe self is like a drop of water in the lotus (leaf). This is overwhelmed by Prakriti. Being overcome he\nis in a state of delusion and does not see the Lord in himself making him act. Content with the mass of\nconstituents and confused, unsteady, in eager pursuit, smitten by desire, yearning, conceited, thinking \u2018I\nam that, this is mine\u2019 he binds himself by himself as in a net, he roams about.\nElsewhere also it has been said. \u2018The agent indeed is the Elemental self. The inner spirit causes actions\nby means of instruments just as iron pervaded by fire and beaten by workers is split into may, so, the\nelemental self pervaded by the inner spirit and pressed by Prakriti becomes many. The group of three\naspects, assuming the forms of 84 Lakhs of living beings constitutes the mass of elemental beings. This\nis the form of plurality. The constituents are impelled by the spirit as a wheel by its driver. As the fire is\nnot beaten (only the iron is), so the elemental self and not the spirit is over-powered.\nIt has been stated: this body without consciousness has been generated by the sex-act \u2013 it is hell \u2013 has\nvia the urinary passage, sustained by bones, covered with flesh and skin, filled with faeces, urine etc., -it is a shattered sheath. It has been affirmed \u2018Delusion, fear, depression, sleep, wound, old age etc.,\nbeing full of these Tamasa and Rajasa traits (like desire), the elemental self is overwhelmed. Hence\nindeed, it inevitably assumes different forms.\nPRAPATHAKA FOUR\nIt has been said: \u2018As waves in great rivers, the past deeds are one\u2019s safeguard \u2013 like the coast line for\nthe ocean. Rebirth is unavoidable \u2013 bound by good and bad results (of actions), as a beast by ropes.\nLike a prisoner, one in the clutches of Death is not free; dwells in the midst of many fears. He who is\nmaddened by worldly pleasures is like one intoxicated. He is in the grip of sin and roams, like one\nbitten by a snake is he in the jaws of danger, as in darkness one is blinded by passion. As caught in a\nmagic show one is in the midst of Maya. He sees every thing wrongly as in a dream, essenceless like\nthe pith of plantain \u2013 like an actor dressed up for a moment \u2013 falsely attractive like a painted wall. It\nhas been stated \u2018sense-objects\u2019 like sound are there, sources of trouble. Attached to them, the self\nforgets the supreme place.\nThe remedy is the winning of knowledge \u2013 following one\u2019s own Dharma, one\u2019s law of life supports all\nlike a tree-trunk. By this law does one go upwards; without it one tumbles down \u2013 this has been laid\ndown in the Vedas. A transmission of the law cannot really be in the Ashrama (stage of life). One who\nis in the Ashrama is said to be a real ascetic.\nIt has also been said: \u2018By penance is Sattva got and by Sattva is the (refined) mind; by mind is the spirit\ngot and by the spirit attained, does (transmigration) stop.\nThe following verses are relevant:\nJust as fire without fuel dies in its own source, so the mind by the dying of its modes, calms down in\nthe source. The modes of mind, withdrawn, of the lover of Truth, not deceived by sense objects, are\nfalse. They follow laws of action - migrating life is mind indeed. Take pains to purge it well. What the\nmind dwells on, that fills one\u2019s life. This is the everlasting mystery. With the purged mind, fixed on the\nself, one fears on endless bliss. If the mind attached to sense objects is fixed upon the supreme spirit,\nwho will not be liberated ? Mind is of two kinds: the impure is filled with desires; the pure is without\nthem. When a person makes his mind free from dissolution and restlessness, reaches the mindless state,\nit is the high place. The mind is to be restrained only so long as it is not dissolved in the heart. This is\nknowledge and release too \u2013 rest is mere details. The joy got by the mind which is purified by Samadhi\nand fixed upon the spirit, cannot be described by words but grasped only by the mind. Water mixed in\nwater cannot be distinguished, so also fire in fire and sky in sky, so the mind spirit \u2013 man is freed. Mind\nis the only cause of bondage and liberation: attached to objects, it gives bondage \u2013 without them,\nliberation.\nYou are Bhahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Prajapati, Agni, Varuna, Vayu, Indra, Moon, Manu, Yama, Bhumi,\nAchyuta. In heaven you dwell in your own self in many ways. I bow to you, the lord of all, the soul of\nall, doer of allocations, protector of all; all illusion, all sport are you. The placid in nature, the most\n\nsecret, beyond thought and knowledge without beginning and end.\nIt was all Tamas \u2013 then impelled by the Supreme, it became uneven \u2013 Rajas compelled, becomes\nuneven. This all came out of Sattva, the conscious being, in every person, indicated by thought,\ndetermination and conceit. Prajapati spoke about it. The first bodies are Brahma etc. He is the aspects\nof Tamas, Rudra of Sattva. Vishnu became three-fold, eight-fold etc., unlimited and moves among\ncreatures \u2013 the support of all creatures and their lord, inside and outside them.\nOm!

Chitra Gargyayani, seeking to perform a sacrifice, chose Aruni (as his priest). He (Aruni) sent his\nson Svetaketu (bidding him to) officiate (as priest). When he (came and) sat, Gargyayani asked him:\n\u2018Son of Gautama ! Is (transmigration) terminated in the world in which you will place me, or is there\nany abode in the world where you will place me ?\u2019 He replied: I know this not. Well, let me ask (my)\nteacher. He (Svetaketu) went back to his father and said: \u2018He (as above); asked me, how shall I\nanswer ?\u2019 He (the father) said: \u2018I also do not know this. Let us pursue our Vedic studies in his residence\nand get what (information) others offer. Let us both go\u2019.\nThen, with fuel, in hand he (Aruni) returned to Chitra Gargyayani and said, \u2018Let me approach you as a\ndisciple\u2019. To him (Aruni) then, he said: \u2018Worthy of sacred knowledge are you, Gautama, who\napproached me (as a pupil). Come, I shall make it known to you\u2019.\nI-2. He said : \u2018Whoever depart from this world, all get to the moon. In the earlier half (of the lunar\nmonth) it (the moon) flourishes on their vital breaths; in the later half, it causes them to be reproduced.\n\nThe moon verily is the door of the heavenly world. Who so answers it (aright), him it sets free (to go\nfurther). (but) him who does not answer, having become rain, (it) rains down here. Here he becomes a\nworm or an insect or a fish, or a bird, or a lion, or a boar, or a snake or a tiger or a person or some other\nin this or that condition according to his deeds and knowledge. Him who has come thus, one asks:\n\u2018Who are you ?\u2019 He should reply:\n\u2018O seasons, from the Resplendent (moon) the seed has been gathered as it was falling from the fifteenfold (the half lunar month) from the home of the fathers. As such, put me in a man as an agent. With the\nman as an agent, in a mother infuse me.\n\u2018I am born, being born forth as the twelfth or thirteenth succeeding month by means of twelve-fold or\nthirteen-fold father (the year). In the knowledge of that am I; for the knowledge of the opposite am I.\nSo strive, O seasons, to make me immortal, by that truth, by that austerity, I am a season. I am of the\nseason, Who are you ? \u2018I am you\u2019. He lets him go further.\nI-3. \u2018Having entered upon this Path of the gods, he comes to the world of Fore, (then) the world of Air,\n(then) the world of Varuna, (then) the world of Aditya, (then) the world of Indra; (then) the world of\nPrajapati, (then) the world of Brahma. This world of Brahma has a lake of Ara, the moments of\nYeshtihas the river Vijara, the three Ilya, the city Salajja, the abode Aparajita, the door-keepers Indra\nand Prajapati, the hall Vibhu, the throne Vichakshana, the couch Amitaujas, the beloved Manasi and her\ncounterpart Chaksusi, who taking flowers verily weave the worlds, the mothers, the nurses, the nymphs\nand the rivers. To it comes he who knows this. To him Brahma (says), \u2018Run ye. With my glory verily he\nhas reached the river Viraja, the ageless. He verily will not grow old.\nI-4. \u2018To him go five hundred Apsarases, hundred carrying garlands, hundred carrying ointments,\nhundred carrying aromatics, hundred with vestments, hundred with fruits. They adorn him with the\nornaments of Brahma. Adorned with Brahma\u2019s ornaments, a knower of Brahma goes unto Brahma. He\ncomes to the lake Ara: he crosses it with his mind. On coming to it, those who know (only) the\nimmediate (present) sink. He comes to the moments Yestihas these run away from him. He comes to\nthe river Viraja. He crosses it with his mind alone. There he shakes off his good and evil deeds. His\ndear relations succeed to the good deeds, those not dear to the evil deeds. Then just as one driving a\nchariot looks at the wheel of the chariot, so he looks upon day and night; so upon good deeds and evil\ndeeds and upon of pairs of opposites. Thus he, the knower of Brahman, devoid of good deeds, devoid\nof evil deeds, goes on to Brahman.\nI-5. He comes to the tree Ilya and the fragrance of Brahma enters into him. He comes to the city\nSalajja; the flavour of Brahma enters into him. He comes to the abode Aparajita; the might of Brahma\nenters him. He comes to the door-keepers Indra and Prajapati; they run away from him. He comes to\nthe hall Vibhu; the glory of Brahma enters into him. He comes to the throne Vichaksana; the Brihad and\nthe Rathantara samans are its two fore-feet; the \u2018Syaita and Naudhasa, the two hind-feet; the Vairupa\nand the Vaichaja the two lengthwise pieces; the Sakvara and Raivata the two cross ones. It is\nIntelligence; for by intelligence one discerns.\nHe comes to the couch Amitaujas (of unmeasured splendour); this is the vital breath. The past and the\nfuture are its two fore feet; prosperity and earth are the two hind-feet; the Bhadra and the Yajnayajniya\n(Samans) the two head-pieces. The Brihad and the Rathantara are the two lengthwise pieces. The verses\nand the chants and the cords are stretched lengthwise. The sacrificial formulas are the cross ones. Some\nstems are the spread; the Udgitha the bolster; prosperity the pillow. On it Brahma sits. He who knows\nthus ascends it with one foot only at first. Brahma asks him: Who are you ? To him he should answer: I\nam a season, of the seasons. From space as a womb I am produced as the semen for a wife, as the\nbrilliance of the year, as the self of every single being. What you are that am I\u2019. To him he says, \u2018Who\nam I\u2019.\nI-6. Self as Truth; it is the Self of all and is Brahman. He should say, \u2018The Real\u2019. \u2018What is that, viz., the\nReal ?\u2019 What is other than the gods (sense-organs) and the vital breaths, that is the sat (what is) As for\nthe gods and the vital breaths, they are the tvam (the you). This is expressed by the word satyam. It is\n\nas extensive as all this. You are this world-all. Thus then he speaks to him. This very thing has been\nexpressed by a Rig verse:\nHaving Yajus as her belly, having the Saman as his head\nHaving the Rik as his form imperishable.\nIs Brahman \u2013 thus is he to be known.\nThe great seen consists on the Vedas.\nHe says to him; \u2018Wherewith does one acquire many masculine names ?\u2019 He should answer: \u2018With the\nvital breath\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith does one acquire the feminine names?\u2019 \u2018With speech\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith the neater ones ?\u2019 With the mind\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith the odours ?\u2019 \u2018With the smell\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith the forms ?\u2019 \u2018With the eye\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith the sounds ?\u2019 \u2018With the ears\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith the taste of food ?\u2019 \u2018With the tongue\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith actions ?\u2019 \u2018With two hands\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith pleasure and pain ?\u2019 \u2018With the body\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith bliss, delight and procreation ?\u2019 \u2018With the generative organ\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith the going ?\u2019 \u2018With the two feet\u2019.\n\u2018Wherewith thoughts, what is to be understood and desires ?\u2019 \u2018With intelligence\u2019, he should say. To him\nhe says, \u2018The waters, verily, indeed are my world. That is yours ? Whatever victory is Brahma\u2019s,\nwhatever attainment, that victory he wins, that attainment he attains, who knows this, who knows thus\u2019.\nII-1. \u2018Prana (the vital Breath) is Brahma, thus indeed Kausitaki used to say. Of this same vital Breath\nwhich is Brahma, verily mind is the messenger; the eye the protector; the ear the announcer; speech the\nencloser. He who verily knows mind as the messenger of this Vital Breath that is Brahma becomes the\nmessenger. He who knows eye as the protector becomes possessed of a protector; he who knows the ear\nas the announcer becomes possessed of an announcer: he who knows speech as the encloser becomes\npossessed of an encloser.\nTo this vital Breath as Brahma all these gods (i.e., mind, age, ear, speech) bring offerings unbegged.\nLikewise, indeed, to this vital Breath all beings bring offerings unbegged.\nThe secret doctrine of him who knows this: One should not beg. It is as if, having begged of a village\nand not having received (anything), one should sit down saying, \u2018I shall not eat (anything) that is given\nfrom here\u2019. Those very ones who previously refused now invite him. This is the law for one who begs\nnot. But those who invite him are the givers of food (saying) \u2018Let us give it to you\u2019.\nII-2. \u2018The vital Breath is Brahma\u2019. Thus indeed Paingya used to say. Of this vital Breath on Brahma\nbehind the speech the eye is enclosed; behind the eye the ear is enclosed; behind the ear, the mind is\nenclosed; behind the mind the vital Breath is enclosed. To this same vital Breath as Brahma all these\ngods bring offering unbegged. Even so to this same vital Breath all beings living bring offering\nunbegged only. Of him who knows this the secret doctrine is: \u2018One should not beg\u2019. It is as if, having\nbegged and not having received (anything), one should sit down saying \u2018I shall not eat (anything) that\nis given from here\u2019. Those very ones who previously refused now invite him. This is the law for one\nwho begs not. But those who invite him are the givers of food (saying) \u2018Let us give to you\u2019.\nII-3. Now, next, the procuring of the highest treasure.\nIf one should covet the highest treasure, either on the night of a full moon or on the night of a new\nmoon or during the bright half of the moon under an auspicious constellation \u2013 at one of these periods \u2013\nhaving built up a fire, having swept around, having shown the sacred grass, having sprinkled around,\nhaving bent the right knee, with a spoon or with a wooden bowl, or with a metal cup, he offers\noblations of melted butter (with the words);\nThe divinity named speech is a procurer.\n\nMay it procure this thing for me from so and so. To it hail !\nThe divinity named vital Breath is a procurer.\nMay it procure this thing for me from so and so. To it hail !\nThe divinity named eye is a procurer. May it procure this thing for me from so and so.\nTo it hail !\nThe divinity named ear is a procurer. May it procure this thing for me from so and so.\nTo it hail !\nThe divinity named mind is a procurer. May it procure this thing for me from so and so.\nTo it hail !\nThe divinity named intelligence is a procurer. May it procure this thing for me from so and so. To it hail\n!\nThen having inhaled the smell of the smoke, having rubbed his limbs over with the ointment of melted\nbutter, silently he should go forth, declare his object or send a messenger. He obtains here indeed.\nII-4. Now next the longing to be realized with the divine powers.\nIf one should desire to become beloved of a man or of a woman or of men or of women, at one of these\nsame points of time, having built up a fire, he offers in exactly the same manner, oblations of melted\nbutter, saying I \u2018Your speech I sacrifice in me, you so and so; Hail !\nYour vital Breath I sacrifice in me, you so and so; Hail !\nYour eye I sacrifice in me, you so and so; Hail !\nYour ear I sacrifice in me, you so and so; Hail !\nYour mind I sacrifice in me, you so and so; Hail !\nYour intelligence I sacrifice in me, you so and so; Hail !\nThen having inhaled the smell of the smoke, having rubbed his limbs over with a smearing of the\nmelted butter, silently he should go forth and desire to approach and touch or he may simply stand and\nconverse from windward. He becomes beloved indeed.\nThe longing for him indeed.\nII-5. Now, next, self-restraint according to Pratardana or the Inner Agnihotra as they call it. Verily as\nlong as a person is peaking, he is not able to breathe. Then he is sacrificing vital breath in speech. As\nlong, verily, as a person is breathing, he is not able to speak. Then he is sacrificing speech in breath.\nThese two are unending immortal oblations. Waking or sleeping, one is continuously, uninterruptedly\nmaking them. Now whatever other oblations there are, they have an end, for they consist of works.\nKnowing this very thing, verily, the ancients did not offer the Agnihotra sacrifice.\nII-6. Now, what is Brahman ! The Uktha (Recitation) is Brahman (sacred word) \u2013 Thus indeed was\nSushkabhangara wont to say. One should meditate on it as the Rig (the hymn of praise); Unto him\nindeed all beings sing praise for his greatness. One should meditate on it as the Yajus (the sacrificial\nformula); Unto him indeed are all beings united for his greatness. One should meditate on it as the\nSaman (chant); Unto him indeed all beings bow down for his greatness. One should meditate on it as\nSri (beauty). One should meditate on it as Yasas (glory); One should meditate on it as Tejas\n(splendour). As this (Uktha) is the most beautiful, the most glorious, the most splendid among the\ninvocations of praise (Shastras), even so is he who knows this the most beautiful, the most glorious, the\nmost splendid among all beings.\nSo the Adhvaryu priest prepares this self which is related to the sacrifice and which consists of work. In\nit he weaves what consists of the Yajus. In what consists of the Yajus, the Hotir priest weaves what\nconsists of the Rig. In what consists of the Rig the Udgatir priest weaves what consists of the Saman.\nThis is the self of all the three-fold knowledge. And thus he who knows this becomes the self of Indra.\nII-7. The all-conquering Kausitaki indeed was wont to worship the rising sun, having performed the\ninvestiture with the sacred thread, having fetched water, having thrice sprinkled the water vessel\nsaying, \u2018 You are a deliverer; take my sin away\u2019. In the same way he was (wont to worship the sun)\nwhen it was in the mind-heaven saying, \u2018You are the high deliverer, take my sin away !\u2019 In the same\n\nway he was (wont to worship the sun) when it was setting saying. \u2018You are the full deliverer; take my\nsin fully away\u2019. Whatever sin he committed by day or by night that it takes away.\nLikewise also he who knows this worships the sun in the same manner. Whatever sin one commits by\nday or by night it takes away fully.\nII-8. Now, month by month at the time of the new moon when it comes round one should, in the same\nway, worship the moon as it appears in the west or throw two blades of grass towards it saying:\nThat heart of mind, of fair outlines\nWhich in the sky in moon doth rest,\nI think I am knower of that,\nMay I not weep for children\u2019s ill.\nIndeed his children do not pre-decease him. Thus is it with one to whom a son has been born.\nNow in the case of one to whom a son has not been born. \u2018Increase. May (vigour) enter thee. May milk\nand food gather in thee, may that which the Adityas gladden.\u2019 Having muttered these three \u2018me, verses,\nhe says: Do not increase by our vital breath, by our offspring, by our cattle. He who hates us and him\nwhom we hate, increase by his breath, by his offspring, by his cattle. I turn myself with Indra\u2019s turn; I\nturn myself along with the turn of the sun\u2019. Thus he turns himself towards the right arm.\nII-9. Thus on the night of the full moon one should worship in the same way the moon as it appears in\nthe east saying: \u2018You are the far shining King Soma, the five-mouthed, the Lord of creation. The\nBrahmana is one mouth of you. With that mouth you eat the Kings. With that mouth make me an eater\nof food. The King is one mouth of you. With that mouth you eat the people. With that mouth make me\nan eater of food. The hawk is one mouth of you. With that mouth you eat birds. With that mouth make\nme an eater of food. Fire is one mouth of you. With that mouth you eat this world. With that mouth\nmake me an eater of food. In you is a fifth mouth. With that mouth you eat all beings. With that mouth\nmake me an eater of food.\u2019\nII-10. Waste not away with our vital breath, our offspring, or cattle. He who hates us and him whom we\nhate \u2013 waste away with his vital breath, his offspring, his cattle.\nThus I turn myself with the turn of the gods; I turn myself with the turn of the sun. Afterwards, he turns\nhimself towards the right arm.\nNow, when about to lie down with a wife one should touch her heart and say:\nThat which in thy heart, O fair one, is placed-within Prajapati.\nTherewith, O Queen of Immortality, may you not come on children\u2019s ill.\nHer children do not then pre-decease her.\nII-11. Now, when one has been away, on returning, he should kiss his son\u2019s head and say: From every\nlimb of mine are you born. \u2018From my heart are you born; O son, you are indeed myself. May you live a\nhundred autumns long ! So and so, he takes his name. \u2018Become a stone ! Become an axe. Become\nunconquerable gold. A brilliance, son, indeed you are, so live a hundred autumns long !\u2019 So and so, he\ntakes his name.\nThen he embraces him saying, \u2018Wherewith Prajapati embraced his creatures for their welfare, therewith\nI embrace you, so and so.\nThen he mutters in his right ear: \u2018Confer on him, O Maghavan, O Onrusher\u2019 and in his left (ear), \u2018O\nIndra, grant most excellent possessions. Do not cut off (the line of our race). Be not afraid; live a\nhundred autumns of life. Son I kiss your head with your name\u2019. Thrice he should kiss his head. \u2018I make\na lowing over you with a lowing of cows\u2019. Thrice he should make a lowing over his head.\nII-12. Now, next, the dying around of the gods.\nThis Brahman verily shines when the fire blazes; likewise it dies when it blazes not. Its brilliance goes\nto the sun; its vital breath to the wind. This Brahman verily shines when the sun is seen; likewise it dies\nwhen it is not seen. Its brilliance goes to the moon; its vital breath to the wind. This Brahman verily\nshines forth when the lightning flashes; likewise it dies when it flashes not. Its brilliance goes to the\nregions of space; its vital breath to the wind. All these divinities, verily, having entered into the wind,\n\nperish not when they die in the wind. There from, indeed, they come forth again. Thus with reference to\nthe divinities.\nII-13. Now, with reference to the Self.\nThis Brahman, verily, shines forth when one speaks with speech; likewise this dies when one speaks\nnot. Its brilliance goes to the eye; its vital breath to the vital breath. This Brahman verily shines when\none sees with the eye; likewise this dies when one sees not. Its brilliance goes to the ear; its vital breath\nto the vital breath. This Brahman verily shines when one hears with the ear; likewise this dies when one\nhears not. Its brilliance goes to the mind; is vital breath to the vital breath. This Brahman, verily, shines\nwhen one thinks with the mind; likewise it dies wen one thinks not. Its brilliance goes to the vital\nbreath; its vital breath to the vital breath. All these divinities, verily, have entered into the vital breath\nperish not when they did in the vital breath. Therefrom, indeed, they come forth again. So, verily,\nindeed, if upon one who knows this, both the mountains, the southern and the northern, should roll\nthemselves forth seeking to crush him, they would not crush him. But those who hate him and those\nwhom he himself hates \u2013 all these die around him.\nII-14. Now, next, the assumption of superior excellence.\nAll these divinities, verily, disputing among themselves in regard to self-superiority went forth from\nthis body. Not breathing, it lay dry like a piece of wood. Then speech entered into it. It just lay speaking\nwith speech. Then the eye entered into it; it just lay speaking with speech, seeing with the eye. Then the\near entered into it; it just lay speaking with speech, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear. Then the\nmind entered into it; it just lay speaking with speech, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear, thinking\nwith the mind. Then the vital breath entered into it and then, indeed, it at once arose. All these\ndivinities, having verily recognised to superior excellence of the vital breath, having comprehended the\nvital breath alone as the self of intelligence, went forth from this body, all together. They having\nentered into the wind, having the nature of space went to the heavenly world. Likewise also indeed he\nwho knows this, having recognised the superior excellence of the vital breath, having comprehended\nthe vital breath alone as the self of intelligence, goes out of the body with all these. Having entered into\nthe wind, having the nature of space, he goes to heaven. He goes there where these gods are. Having\nreached that, he who knows this becomes immortal as the gods are immortal.\nII-15. Now, next, the father-and-son ceremony or the transmission, as they call it.\nA father, about to depart, calls his son. Having strewn the house with new grass, having built up the\nfire, having placed near it a vessel of water with a jug, himself covered with a fresh garment the father\nremains lying. Having come, the son lies down on top touching organs with organs. Or (the father) may\ntransmit to him seated face to face. Then he delivers over to him (thus):\nFather: My speech in you I would place.\nSon: I take your speech in me.\nFather: My breath in you I would place.\nSon: I take your breath in me.\nFather: My eye in you I would place.\nSon: I take your eye in me.\nFather: My ear in you I would place.\nSon: I take your ear in me.\nFather: My tastes of food in you I would place.\nSon: I take your tastes of food in me.\nFather: My deeds in you I would place.\nSon: I take your deeds in me.\nFather: My pleasure and pain in you I would place.\nSon: I take your pleasure and pain in me.\nFather: My bliss, delight, procreation in you I would place.\nSon: I take your bliss, delight and procreation in me.\n\nFather: My movement in you I would place.\nSon: I take your movement in me.\nFather: My mind in you I would place.\nSon: I take your mind in me.\nFather: My intelligence in you I would place.\nSon: I take your intelligence in me.\nIf, however, he should be unable to speak much, let the father say summarily, \u2018My vital breaths in you I\nwould place\u2019 and the son (reply) \u2018You vital breaths I take in me\u2019.\nThen turning to the right he goes towards the east. The father calls out after him: \u2018My glory, sacred\nlusture and fame delight in you\u2019. Then the other looks over his left shoulder. Having hid (his face) with\nhis hand or having covered (it) with the edge of his garment, he says: \u2018May you obtain heavenly worlds\nand all desires\u2019. If the father should become well he should dwell under the lordship of his son; or, he\nshould wander (as a mendicant). If, however, he should die let them perform obsequies as they should\nbe performed.\nIII-1. Pratardana, the son of Divodasa, by means of fighting and virility, verily reached the beloved\nabode of Indra. To him then Indra Said: Pratardana, choose a boon.\nThen said Pratardana: Do you yourself choose that boon for me which you deem most beneficent for\nman. To him then Indra said: A superior verily chooses not for an inferior. Do you yourself choose. \u2018No\nboon verily then is it to me\u2019 said Pratardana. But Indra did not depart from the truth, for Indra is truth.\nTo him then Indra said: \u2018Understand me only. This indeed I deem most beneficent to man, namely that\none should understand me. I slew the three-headed Tvastir; I delivered the Arunmukhas, the ascetics, to\nthe wolves. Transgressing many compacts I killed the people of Prahlada in the sky, the Paulomas in\nthe atmosphere, the Kalakanjas on the earth. Of me, such as I was then, not a single hair was injured.\nSo he knows me thus \u2013 by no deed whatever of his is his world injured, not by stealing, not by killing\nan embryo, not by the murder of his mother, not by the murder of his father. If he has done any evil, the\ndark colour departs not from his face.\nIII-2. Then he (Indra) said: I am the Spirit of the vital breath, the intelligent Self. As such, worship me\nas life, as immortality. Life is the vital breath: the vital breath is life. For as long as the vital breath\nremains in the body so long is there life. For indeed with the vital breath one obtains immortality in this\nworld; with intelligence, true conception. So he who worships me as life, as immortality, reaches the\nfull term of life in this world; he obtains immortality and indestructibility in the heavenly world.\nNow, on this point some say: The vital breaths, verily, go into a unity: (otherwise) one would not be\nable at once to make known a name by speech, a form by the eye, a sound by ear, a thought by the\nmind. The vital breaths, as a unity, verily, cause to know all things here, one by one. All the vital\nbreaths speak along with speech when it speaks. All the vital breaths see along with the eye when it\nsees. All the vital breaths hear along with the ear when it hears. All the vital breaths think along with\nthe mind when it thinks. All the vital breaths breathe along with the breath when it breathes.\n\u2018That is indeed so\u2019, said Indra. There is however a superior excellence among the vital breaths.\nIII-3. One lives with speech gone, for we see the dumb.\nOne lives with eye gone, for we see the blind.\nOne lives with ear gone, for we see the deaf.\nOne lives with mind gone, for we see the childish.\nOne lives with arms cut off; One lives with legs cut off; for thus we see.\nBut now it is the vital breath, even the self of intelligence, that seizes hold of this body and raises it up.\nThis, therefore, one should worship as the Uktha. This is the all-obtaining in the vital breath. As for the\nvital breath, verily, that is intelligence; as for the intelligence, verily that is vital breath. This is the view\nthereof, this is the understanding thereof.\nWhen a person is so asleep that he sees no dream whatever, then he becomes one with that vital breath.\n\nThen speech together with all names goes to it; the eye together with all forms goes to it; the ear\ntogether with all sounds goes to it; the mind together with all thoughts goes to it. When he awakes, as\nfrom a blazing fire sparks would fly in all directions, even so from this self the vital breaths proceed to\ntheir respective stations; from the vital breaths, the gods (the senses); from the gods, the worlds. This\nsame vital breath, the self of intelligence, seizes hold of the body and raises it up. This therefore one\nshould worship as the Uktha. This is the all-obtaining in the vital breath.\nAs for the vital breath, verily that is the Self as the intelligence; as for the intelligence, that is the vital\nbreath. This is the proof of it, the understanding of it.\nWhen a weak person is about to die, comes to such weakness that he falls into a stupor, they say of\nhim, \u2018His thoughts have departed; he hears not; he speaks not with speech; he thinks not\u2019. Thus he\nbecomes one with the vital breath alone. Then, speech together with all names goes to it; the eye\ntogether with all forms goes to it; the ear together with all sounds goes to it; the mind together with all\nthoughts goes to it.\nWhen he departs from his body, he departs together with all these. When he awakens, as from a blazing\nfire sparks would fly in all directions, even so from this Self the vital breaths proceed to their respective\nstations; from the vital breaths the gods; from the gods the worlds.\nIII-4. When he departs from the body, speech pours all names into him; by speech he obtains all names.\nVital breath pours all odours into him; with breath he obtains all odours. The eye pours all forms into\nhim; with the eye he obtains all forms. The ear pours all sounds into him; with the ear he obtains all\nsounds. The mind pours all thoughts into him. With the mind he obtains all thoughts. This is the allobtaining in the vital breath.\nAs for the vital breath, verily that is the intelligence. As for the intelligence, verily that is the vital\nbreath; for, together, these two dwell in this body; together the two depart. Now, then, we will explain\nhow all beings become one with this intelligence.\nIII-5. Speech is one portion taken out of it. Name is its externally correlated object element. Breath is\none portion taken out of it. Odour is its externally correlated object element. The eye is one portion\ntaken out of it. Form is its externally correlated object element. The ear is one portion taken out of it.\nSound is its externally correlated object element. The tongue is one portion taken out of it. Taste of\nfood is its externally correlated object element. The two hands are one portion taken out of it. Work is\ntheir externally correlated object element. The body is one portion taken out of it. Pleasure and pain is\nits externally correlated object element. The generative organ is one portion taken out of it. Bliss,\ndelight and procreation are its externally correlated object element. The two feet are one portion taken\nout of it. Goings are their externally correlated object element. The mind is one portion taken out of it.\nThoughts and desires are its externally correlated object element.\nIII-6. With speech, mounted on by intelligence, one obtains all names.\nWith the vital breath, mounted on by intelligence, one obtains all odours.\nWith the eye, mounted on by intelligence, one obtains all forms.\nWith the ear, mounted on by intelligence, one obtains all sounds.\nWith the tongue, mounted on by intelligence, one obtains all tastes.\nWith the hands, mounted on by intelligence, one obtains all works.\nWith the body, mounted on by intelligence, one obtains pleasure and pain.\nWith the generative organ, mounted on by intelligence, one obtains bliss, delight and procreation.\nWith the feet, mounted on by intelligence, one obtains all goings.\nWith the mind, mounted on by intelligence, one obtains all thoughts, what is to be understood by\nthought and desire.\nIII-7. For verily without intelligence speech would not make any name whatsoever known.\n\u2018My mind was elsewhere\u2019 one says, \u2018I did not cognise that name\u2019.\nFor verily without intelligence breath would not make any odour whatsoever known.\n\u2018My mind was elsewhere\u2019 one says, \u2018I did not cognise that odour\u2019.\n\nFor verily without intelligence the eye would not make any form whatsoever known.\n\u2018My mind was elsewhere\u2019 one says, \u2018I did not cognise that form\u2019.\nFor verily without intelligence the ear would not make any sound whatsoever known.\n\u2018My mind was elsewhere\u2019 one says, \u2018I did not cognise the sound\u2019.\nFor verily without intelligence the tongue would not make any taste of food whatsoever known. \u2018My\nmind was elsewhere\u2019 one says, \u2018I did not cognise that taste of food\u2019.\nFor verily without intelligence the two hands would not make any action whatsoever known. \u2018My mind\nwas elsewhere\u2019 one says, \u2018I did not cognise that action\u2019.\nFor verily without intelligence the body would not make known any pleasure or pain whatsoever. \u2018My\nmind was elsewhere\u2019 one says, \u2018I did not cognise that pleasure and pain\u2019.\nFor verily without intelligence the generative organ would not make known any bliss, delight and\nprocreation whatsoever. \u2018My mind was elsewhere\u2019 one says, \u2018I did not cognise that bliss, delight and\nprocreation\u2019.\nFor verily without intelligence the two feet would not make known any going whatsoever. \u2018My mind\nwas elsewhere\u2019 one says, \u2018I did not cognise that going\u2019.\nFor verily without intelligence no thought whatever would be effected, nothing cognisable would be\ncognized.\nIII-8. One has to win the pure knowledge of the unity of Brahman and Atman.\nSpeech is not what one should seek to know; one should know the speaker.\nSmell is not what one should seek to know; one should know the smeller.\nForm is not what one should seek to know; one should know the seer.\nSound is not what one should seek to know; one should know the hearer.\nTaste of food is not what one should seek to know; one should know the knower of the taste of food.\nDeed is not what one should seek to know; one should know the doer.\nPleasure and pain are not what one should seek to know; one should know the discerner of pleasure and\npain.\nBliss, delight and procreation are not what one should seek to know; one should know the discerner of\nbliss, delight and procreation.\nGoing is not what one should seek to know; one should know the goer.\nMind is not what one should seek to know; one should know the thinker.\nThese ten essential elements, verily, are with reference to intelligence. These ten intelligential elements\nare with reference to existence. Verily if there were no elements of existence, there would be no\nelements of intelligence. Verily if there were no elements of intelligence, there would be no elements of\nexistence. Truly from either alone, no form whatever would be possible.\nAnd this (the Self of intelligence) is not diverse. But as of a chariot, the felly is fixed on the spokes and\nthe spokes are fixed on the hub, even so these elements of existence are fixed on the elements of\nintelligence; the elements of intelligence are fixed on the vital breath.\nThis vital breath, truly, is the Self of intelligence: (it is) bliss, ageless, immortal. He does not become\ngreater with good action nor indeed lesser with bad action. This one truly indeed causes him whom he\nwishes to lead up from this world to perform good action. This one also indeed causes him whom he\nwishes to lead downwards to perform bad action. He is the protector of the world; he is the sovereign of\nthe world; he is the Lord of all. \u2018He is myself\u2019 \u2013 this one should know. \u2018He is my Self\u2019 \u2013 This one\nshould know.\nIV-1. Now then verily there was Gargya Balaki, a famed Vedic scholar. He dwelt among the Ushinaras,\nthe Satvans and the Matsyas, among the Kurus and the Panchalas, among the Kashis and the Videhas.\nHaving come to Ajatasatru of Kashi, he said, \u2018Let me declare Brahman to you\u2019. To him then Ajatasatru\nsaid: \u2018A thousand (cows) we give to you\u2019. At such a word as this, verily indeed people would run\ntogether, crying \u2018A Janaka ! A Janaka !\u2019\n\nIV-2. In the sun the great, in the moon the food, in the lightning truth, in thunder sound, in wind Indra\nVaikuntha, in space the plenum, in fire the Vanquisher, in water brilliance \u2013 thus with reference to the\ndivinities. Now, with reference to the self; in the mirror the reflection; in the shadow the double, in the\necho life, in sound death, in sleep Yama (the Lord of Death), in the body Prajapati, in the right eye\nspeech, in the left eye truth.\nIV-3. Then said Balaki: Him who is this person in the sun, on him I indeed meditate. To him Ajatasatru\nsaid: Make me not to converse on him ! As the great, the white-robed, the Supreme, the head of all\nbeings \u2013 thus verily do I meditate on him. He who meditates on him thus becomes indeed the supreme,\nthe head of all beings.\nIV-4. Then said Balaki: \u2018him who is the person in the moon, on him indeed do I meditate\u2019. To him then\nAjatasatru said: Make me not to converse on him ! I meditate on him asking Soma, as the self of food.\nHe who meditates on him thus becomes indeed the self of food.\nIV-5. Then said Balaki: \u2018I meditate on the person, indeed, who is the person in the lightning\u2019. To him\nthen Ajatasatru said: Make me not to converse on him ! I meditate on him as the self of truth. He who\nmeditates on him thus becomes indeed the self of truth (of brilliance).\nIV-6. Then said Balaki: I meditate on the person in the Thunder\u2019. To him then Ajatasatru said: Make me\nnot to converse on him ! I meditate on him as the self of sound. He who meditates on him thus becomes\nindeed the self of sound.\nIV-7. Then said Balaki: I meditate on the person in wind\u2019. To him then Ajatasatru said: Make me not to\nconverse on him ! I meditate on him as Indra Vaikuntha or as the unconquered army. He who meditates\non him thus becomes indeed the triumphant, the unconquerable, a conqueror of adversaries.\nIV-8. Then said Balaki: I meditate on the person in space\u2019. To him then Ajatasatru said: Make me not to\nconverse on him ! I meditate on him as the full moon-active Brahman. He who meditates on him thus\nbecomes filled with offspring, cattle, fame, the radiance of sanctity and the heavenly world, he reaches\nthe full term of life.\nIV-9. Then said Balaki: I meditate on the person in fire\u2019. To him then Ajatasatru said: Make me not to\nconverse on him ! I meditate on him as the Vanquisher. He who meditates on him thus become verily a\nvanquisher of others.\nIV-10. Then said Balaki: I meditate on the person in water\u2019. To him then Ajatasatru said: Make me not\nto converse on him ! I meditate on him as the Self of Brilliance of name. Thus with reference to the\ndivinities..\nIV-11. Now, with reference to self.\nThen said Balaki: I meditate indeed on the person in the mirror\u2019. To him Ajatasatru said: Make me not\nto converse on him ! I meditate on him as (the reflected) likeness. He, then, who meditates on him thus,\na very likeness of him is born in his offspring, not an unlikeness.\nIV-12. Then said Balaki: I meditate indeed on the person in the shadow\u2019. To him Ajatasatru said: Make\nme not to converse on him ! I meditate on him as the inseparable Double. He, then, who meditates on\nhim thus obtains from his second and becomes possessed of his double.\nIV-13. Then said Balaki: I meditate indeed on the person in the echo\u2019. To him Ajatasatru said: Make me\nnot to converse on him ! I meditate on him as life. He, then, who meditates on him thus passes not into\nunconsciousness before his time.\nIV-14. Then said Balaki: I meditate indeed on the person in sound\u2019. To him Ajatasatru said: Make me\nnot to converse on him ! I meditate on him as Death. He, then, who meditates on him thus does not die\nbefore his time.\nIV-15. Then said Balaki: I meditate indeed on the person who, while asleep, moves about in dream\u2019. To\nhim Ajatasatru said: Make me not to converse on him ! I meditate on him as King Yama ! He, then,\nwho meditates on him thus, to his supremacy everything here is subdued.\nIV-16. Then said Balaki: I meditate on the person who is in this body\u2019. To him Ajatasatru said: Make\nme not to converse on him ! I meditate on him as Prajapati. He then who meditates on him thus is\n\naugmented with offspring, cattle, fame, the lustre of sanctity, the heavenly world; he reaches the full\nterm of life.\nIV-17. Then said Balaki: I meditate on the person in the right eye\u2019. To him Ajatasatru said: Make me\nnot to converse on him ! I meditate on him as the self of speech, the self of fire, the self of light. He\nthen who meditates on him thus becomes the self of all these.\nIV-18. Then said Balaki: I meditate on the person in the left eye\u2019. To him Ajatasatru said: Make me not\nto converse on him ! I meditate on him as the self of truth, the self of lightning, the self of brightness.\nHe then who meditates on him thus becomes the self of all these.\nIV-19. Thereupon Balaki was silent. To him then Ajatasatru said: So much only Balaki ? \u2018So much\nonly\u2019 replied Balaki. To him, then, Ajatasatru said: In vain, indeed, did you make to converse saying\n\u2018Let me declare Brahman to you\u2019. He, indeed. Balaki, who is the maker of these persons, of whom\nverily this is the work, he alone is to be known.\nThereupon Balaki, fuel in hand, approached saying, \u2018Receive me as a pupil\u2019. To him then Ajatasatru\nsaid: \u2018This I deem a form (of conduct) contrary to nature that a Kshatriya should receive a Brahmana as\npupil. (But come). I shall make you understand\u2019. Then taking him by the hand, he went forth. The two\nthen came upon a person asleep. The Ajatasatru called him (saying) \u2018O Great, White-robed King, Soma\n!\u2019 But he just lay silent. Then he pushed him with a stick. He got up at once. To him then Ajatasatru\nsaid: Where in this case, O Balaki, has this person lain ? What has become of him here ? Whence has\nhe returned here ?\nThereupon Balaki understood not. To him then Ajatasatru said: Where in this case, O Balaki has this\nperson lain, what has become of him here, whence he has returned here as I asked is the arteries of a\nperson (of the heart) called Hita (the beneficent). From the heart they spread forth to the pericardium.\nNow they are as minute as a hair divided a thousand-fold. They consist of a minute essence, reddishbrown, white, black, yellow and red. In these one remains while asleep; he sees no dream whatsoever.\nIV-20. Then he becomes unitary in this vital breath. Then speech together with all names goes to it; the\neye together with all forms goes to it; the ear together with all sounds goes to it; the mind together with\nall thoughts goes to it.\nWhen he awakes, as from a blazing fire sparks proceed in all directions, even so from this Self the vital\nbreaths proceed to their respective stations; from the vital breaths, the gods (the sense faculties); from\nthe sense faculties the worlds. This very vital breath, even this Self of intelligence, has entered this\nbodily self up to the hair and the fingernail. Just as a razor might be hidden in a razor-case or as fire in\nthe fireplace, even so this self of intelligence has entered this bodily self upto the very hairs and nails.\nOn that self these other selves depend as upon a chief his own (men) or as his own (men) are of service\nto a chief, even so these other selves are of service to that self of (intelligence). Verily as long as Indra\ndid not understand this Self, so long the Asuras overcame him. When he understood this, striking down\nand conquering the Asuras, he attained pre-eminence among all gods and all beings, sovereignty and\noverlordship.\nLikewise also he who knows this, striking off all evils, attains pre-eminence, sovereignty and\noverlordship over all beings \u2013 he who knows this, yea, he who knows this.\nOm ! May my speech be based on (i.e. accord with) the mind;\nMay my mind be based on speech.\nO Self-effulgent One, reveal Thyself to me.\nMay you both (speech and mind) be the carriers of the Veda to me.\nMay not all that I have heard depart from me.\nI shall join together (i.e. obliterate the difference of) day\nAnd night through this study.\nI shall utter what is verbally true;\nI shall utter what is mentally true.\n\nMay that (Brahman) protect me;\nMay That protect the speaker (i.e. the teacher), may That protect me;\nMay that protect the speaker \u2013 may That protect the speaker.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Kaushitaki-Brahmana Upanishad, as contained in the Rig-Veda.",
    "Brihajjabala": "\nBrihad Jabala Upanishad\nTranslated by P. R. Ramachander\nPublished by celextel.org\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nFirst Brahmana\nBusunda approached Kalagni Rudra (the fire and death like Rudra) and asked him, \u201cPlease tell me\nabout the greatness of Vibhoothi (Sacred ash - Vibhoothi is generally prepared by burning cow dung at\nauspicious times. The Vibhoothi of Pazhani temple is prepared by burning cactus plants). Kalagni\nRudra replied, \u201cWhat is there to tell?\u201d. Then Busunda asked, \u201cPlease tell me the importance of wearing\nVibhoothi and Rudraksha\u2019. Kalagni Rudra replied, \u201cThis has already been related along with phala\nsruthi (resultant effect) by sage Paippalada. There is nothing more to be told more than what he has\nsaid\u201d. Then Busunda asked, \u201cTell me about the route to salvation as told in the great Jabala (Brihat\nJabala)\u201d. Kalagni Rudra agreed and started teaching. 1\nFrom the Sadhyojatha face of Lord Shiva (he has five faces), the earth was born. From it was born the\nNivruthi. From that was born the golden coloured celestial cow called Nanda. From the dung of Nanda\ncame Vibhoothi. 2\n\nWater was produced from the face of Vama Deva. From that, the power called Prathishtaa was\nproduced. From that the black cow called Bhadra was produced. From its dung was produced Bhasitha\n(another name for Vibhoothi). 3\nFire was produced from the face of Aghora. From that was produced the power of knowledge. From\nthat was produced the red cow called Surabhi. From its dung was produced Bhasma (literally ash but\nanother name for Vibhoothi). 4\nWind was produced from the face of Thath Purusha. From it was produced the power of peace. From it\nwas produced the white cow called Susheela. From its dung was produced Kshara (again another name\nfor ash). 5\nEther (sky) was produced from the face of Eeshana. From it was produced the power of\nSandhyatheetha (one who is beyond dawn and dusk). From it was produced the multi coloured cow\ncalled Sumana. From its dung was produced Raksha (literally meaning shield). 6\nVibhoothi, Bhasitham, Bhasmam, Ksharam and Raksha are five different names of the holy ash. All\nthese are causal names. Vibhoothi - because it gives rise to plenty of wealth, Bhasmam - because it eats\naway all sins, Bhasitha - because it makes materials glitter (the potash is a cleaning agent of all metals),\nKshara - because it protects from dangers and Raksha - because it acts like a shield in case of fears of\nghosts, devils, Pisacha, Brahma Rakshas, epilepsy and diseases which are in-born. 7\nSecond Brahmana\nThen Busunda approached Kalagni Rudra and asked him about the Bhasmam (ash) snana (bathing)\nprocedure which involves the fire and the moon. \u201dSimilar to the fact that 'fire' takes several forms\ndepending on the form of the object, 'ash' which is like the soul for all objects, assumes the form\naccording to the shape of the being and also beyond it. Fire is told as becoming the world of fire and\nmoon. Fire is very hot and is terrible. It is cruel. The power of moon is nectar like. Even though it has\nthe basis in nectar, it also is the hot aspect of knowledge. Among the big and tiny things, it is the only\none which is nectar like in taste and light and also very hot\u201d, he told. 1\n\u201cThe shining aspect of strength is of two types - the sun aspect and the fire aspect. Similarly the nectar\nlike strength also is full of light and heat\u201d, he told. 2\nLight resides in aspects like lightning. Sweetness pervades in tastes of extracts. And the average world\nworks within light and taste. 3\nNectar is a part of fire. Due to nectar, the fire grows. That is why, the world which is of the form of fire\nand moon, is like the fire made with the fire-offering (havis-offering). 4\nThe moon power is above .The fire power is down below. It is because that they join together that this\nworld is functioning continuously. 5\n[Mantras 6-8 are not available.]\nThat Shakthi (power, strong effect, the female principle) which rises above is Shiva. That Shiva which\nrises above is Shakthi. There is nothing in this world which is not affected by Shiva and Shakthi. 9\n\nThe world which has been burnt several times by fire, becomes pervasive with ash (Bhasma). This is\nthe strength of the fire. In that strength, ash becomes an integral part. 10\nThus he who understands the strength of ash and does the ash bathing ritual using mantras, \u201cagnireethi\netc\u201d, burns all his sins and attains salvation. 11\n[Mantras 12 & 13 are not available.]\nFor winning over death , the bath of nectar is recommended. Where is the question of death for one\nwho has been touched by nectar of Shiva and Shakthi? 14\nThe one who knows this holy secret method, would purify moon and fire and will not take birth again.\n15\nThe one whose body is burnt by the fire of Shiva and made wet by the nectar of moon and entering the\npath of yoga would become eligible for deathless state. 16\nThird Brahmana\nNow the four fold method of preparing Bhasma (holy ash) is being narrated. First is Anukalpam,\nsecond Upakalpam, third upopakalpam and fourth is Akalpam.\nAnukalpam is made by use of Viraja homa manthras in Agnihothra (collecting ash from the pit of fire\nsacrifice). Collecting dried cow dung lying in the forest and preparing it as per the method suggested in\nKalpam is upakalpam. Collecting the dried cow dung, powdering it, making it in to balls after mixing it\nin cow\u2019s urine and preparing it as per method suggested in kalpam is upopakalpam. What one gets in\ntemples of Shiva is akalpam. This is equivalent to one hundred kalpams. All Basma prepared by any of\nthese four methods leads one to salvation, said Bhagawan Kalagni Rudra.\nFourth Brahmana\nAfterwards Busunda enquired with Bhagawan Kalagni Rudra about wearing Vibhuthi in three lines.\nWhat he said was:\nOn the forehead, you have to apply with the mantra, \u201cBrahmane Namah! (Salutations to Brahma)\u201d.\nOn the chest, you have to apply with the mantra, \u201cHavyavahanaya Namah! (Salutations to he who rides\nthe horse)\u201d.\nOn the stomach, you have to apply with the mantra, \u201cSkandaya Namah! (Salutations to\nSubrahmanya)\u201d.\nOn the neck, you have to apply with the mantra, \u201cVishnave Namaj! (Salutations to Lord Vishnu)\u201d.\nIn the middle, you have to apply with the mantra, \u201cPrapanchanaya Namah! (Salutations to him who\npervades in the entire world)\u201d.\nOn the wrists, you have to apply with the mantra, \u201cVasubhyo Namah! (salutations to him who is like\nnectar)\u201d.\n\nOn the back, you have to apply with the mantra, \u201cHaraye Namah! (Salutations to Lord Hari)\u201d.\nOn the top, you have to apply with the mantra, \u201cShambhave Namag! (Salutations to Lord Shiva)\u201d.\nOn the head, you have to apply with the mantra, \u201cParamathmane Namah! (Salutations to the great soul\nwhich is in all beings)\u201d.\nIn each of these places, you have to apply in a set of three lines. When we are wearing Vibhuthi on the\nforehead, meditate on the great Lord who has three eyes, who is the basis of three qualities and who\nmakes everything visible in sets as \u201cNamah Shivaya!\u201d. Apply Vibhuthi chanting \u201cPithrubhyo Namah!\u201d\nbelow the forearm. Above that apply chanting \u201cEeshanabhyo Namah!\u201d and on sides chanting\n\u201cEeshabhya Namah!\u201d and on the forearms chanting \u201cSwachabhyam Namah!\u201d and on back sides\nchanting \u201cBheemaya Namah!\u201d. On both flanks of the belly put Vibhuthi chanting \u201cShivaya Namah!\u201d\nand on the head chanting \u201cNeela kantaya Sarvathmane Namah!\u201d. This would remove the effects of sins\ndone in the previous births.\nFifth Brahmana\nThose who dishonor the three rows of Vibhuthi dishonor Lord Shiva himself. Those who wear it with\ndevotion, wear Lord Shiva himself. Similar to a village without Lord Shiva\u2019s temple is like a desert,\nthose who do not wear Vibhuthi on their forehead, have a deserted forehead. A life without worship of\nLord Shiva is a deserted life. An education where Lord Shiva is not involved is a useless education. The\ngreatest strength of the fire of Rudra is the holy ash. So anyone wearing the holy ash always is forever\nstrong. The holy ash which is born out of fire, burns off the sins of all Bhasma nishtas. Bhasma nishta\nis one who wears holy ash and possesses clean habits.\nSixth Brahmana\nDuring the marriage of Maharishi Gauthama, all devas became passionate in their minds on seeing\nAhalya. Because of that, they lost their knowledge and approached Sage Durvasa and asked him about\nit. He promised them that he would help them get rid of the sin committed by them because of this and\ntold them, \u201cOnce upon a time by giving the holy ash after chanting the Rudra mantra one hundred\ntimes, even sins like Brahma hathi (sin got by killing a brahmana) have been washed off\u201d. After this he\ngave them the very blessed holy ash. He also told them, \u201cbecause you have heard my words, you would\nbecome more splendorous than before\u201d.\nIt is said that this holy ash can give rise to all sorts of wealth. In front of it are Vasus, on its right are\nRudras, on its back are Adhithyas (suns), on its left are Viswa Devas, in the centre are Brahma, Vishnu\nanid Shiva, and on its sides are the Sun and the Moon. The Rig Veda mantra tells about it (holy ash) as\nfollows,\u201d What is the use of Vedas to a person who does not understand that thing, in whose ether like\nperennial form lives all devas and the worlds? Any one who understands that great matter are the\npeople who have attained that which should be attained.\u201d\nSeventh Brahmana\nThe king of Videha approached the sage Yagnavalkya and asked, \u201dOh, God like sage, please explain to\nme the way of wearing the holy ash\u201d. Yagnavalkya replied, \u201dTake Vibhuthi using the five brahma\nmantras starting with \u201csathyojatham\u201d, chant \u201cagnirithio Basma (ash is fire)\u201d apply using the mantra\n\nstarting with \u201cmanasthoke\u201d. Mix it with water using mantra \u201ctriyayusham\u201d and then apply it on head,\nforehead, chest, and shoulders chanting the mantra \u201ctrayambakam\u201d. If this is followed one becomes\npure and suitable for getting salvation. He would get the same effect as chanting Rudra, one hundred\ntimes. This is called Bhasma Jyothi.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cthe great sages like Samvarthaka, Aarooni, Swethakethu, Durvasa, Rupu, Nidhaga,\nBharatha, Dathathreya, Raivathaka, Busunda etc got freed by wearing Vibhuthi.\u201d\nSanathkumara approached Bhagawan Kalagni Rudra and asked him, \u201cBhagawan, kindly explain me the\nmethod of wearing Rudraksha.\u201d What he told him was, \u201cRudraksha became famous by that name\nbecause initially, it was produced from the eyes of Rudra. During the time of destruction and after the\nact of destruction, when Rudra closed his eye of destruction, Rudraksha was produced from that eye.\nThat is the Rudraksha property of Rudraksha. Just by touching and wearing this Rudraksha, one gets\nthe same effect of giving in charity one thousand cows.\u201d\nEighth Brahmana\nHe who reads this Brihat Jabala Upanishad daily, would attain the purity blessed by Agni (fire God),\nVayu (wind god), Surya (sun), Chandra (moon), Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra. The ones who chant\nBrihat Jabala Upanishad would attain that world where the Sun does not dry, where wind does not\nblow, where moon does not shine, where stars do not twinkle, where fire does not burn, where Yama\n(God of death) does not enter, where there are no sorrows, which is full of peace and pure and\nunalloyed happiness, which is praised by Gods like Brahma, which is meditated upon by great Yogis\nand from where great Yogis do not return after reaching it. This Upanishad ends with the blessing \u201dOm\nSathya!\u201d(long live the truth).\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Brihad-Jabalopanishad, as contained in the Atharva-Veda.",

He is called \u201cNeela Lohitha (He who is red and black)\u201d because his neck is black and the top of\nit is red. In another of his aspects he is Umapathi (husband of Uma) and Pasupathi (Lord of all beings).\nHe holds the bow called \u201cPinaka\u201d and has great luster. He is the god of all knowledge. He is god of all\nbeings. He is the Lord of all Vedas. He is the boss of Brahma and He is praised by Yajur Veda. One\nshould know the praise of Sama Veda of him. Those who know that will attain the deathless state.\nThe Second Upanishad\nDevas were afraid of death, sins and family life. They approached Praja Pathi. He told them about the\nNarasimha Mantra which was \u201cthe King of all Mantras\u201d written in Anushtup meter. Because of this,\n\nthey won victory over death. They won over all sins and also destroyed the problems of family life. So\nany of those who are afraid of death, sins and family life, should get themselves taught the \u201cNarasimha\nMantra\u201d which is called \u201cthe King of Mantras\u201d and which is written in anushtup meter. They all would\nwin over death and win over sin as well problems due to family life.\nThe King of Mantras:\n[The following is a simple translation of the King of Mantras of Lord Narasimha and what follows is an\nexplanation and justification of each description.)\nMy salutations to That Nrusimha,\nWho is fierce,\nWho is heroic,\nWho is Maha Vishnu,\nWho is burning,\nWho has faces every where,\nWho is half Lion and half Man,\nWho is fearful,\nWho is safe,\nWho is death and deathlessness.\nHe is called \u201cUgra [fierce]\u201d because by his power He creates, looks after, destroys and elevates without\nbreak and also attracts all devas, all beings, all bhoothas Hey Lord Narasimha, you who is being\npraised by me, please give me perennial happiness even when I am in this body which is not\npermanent. Let your soldiers kill all my enemies who are different from me. 1\nHe is called \u201cVeera [heroic]\u201d because by his power He makes all worlds, all devas, all beings and all\nboothas play, and allow them to take rest and also creates, helps them grow and attracts without any\nbreak these worlds, devas, beings and boothas. He is behind every action, very capable, mountain like\nand one who fulfills the desires of devas. 2\nHe is \u201cMaha Vishnu\u201d, because he pervades in all the worlds and makes all the world pervade, similar to\nthe fatty gum that spreads in all meat, from this side to that and also from other side to this side. There\nis nothing in the world that is not him. He is pervading in all things in the world. He is the leader of all\nsouls. Worship of souls is His worship. He exists in all the three shining things viz. Moon, Sun and fire.\n3\nHe is called \u201cJwalantham [burning]\u201d, because he makes the entire world which includes all devas, all\nbeings and all Bhoothas shine because of his luster and also shines in them and makes them release\nflames. He is the one who created the world and makes it rapidly multiply. He is the one who shines\nbecause of his own luster and also makes others shine. He spreads heat throughout the world and makes\nthe world swelter. He spreads his rays everywhere and makes them release rays. He has a personality\nwhich causes only good. He gives only that which is good and he is good. 4\nHe is called \u201cSarvatho Mukham [having faces everywhere]\u201d because he sees everywhere without\nhaving any organs, he is able to hear every thing, he is able to go every where, he is able to attract\neverything, and also because he is spread everywhere and exists every where. In the beginning he was\nalone and he has become all these things now. Those who rule over the world came from him. In the\nend everything goes back and merges in him. I salute him who has faces every where. 5\n\nAmong all animals the most fear some and also most special is the lion. That is why God of the\nUniverse took birth as Narasimha. That deathless form became one which does good to the entire\nworld. That is why he is called \u201cNarasimham [half man and half lion]\u201d. That Maha Vishnu who has this\nfearsome form does not cause fear among his devotees. He is being worshipped and praised by them.\nHe is the one who travels all over earth and also one who lives on the mountain top. In his form of\nTrivikrama, he measured all the worlds in three steps. 6\nHe is called \"Bheeshanam [fear full]\u201d because all the crowds of devas, men and Bhoothas and all the\nworlds run away fearing Him; but he is not afraid of anything. The wind blows because it is afraid of\nHim. The Sun rises above because he is afraid of Him. It is because of fear for Him, that the God of\nfire, Indra and the God of death do their work. 7\nHe is called \u201cBhadram [safe]\u2019 because he is good things personified, because he forever shines giving\ngood things, because he makes others shine, because he is superior and because he does very good\nthings. Hey Devas, we have to hear with our ears about this \u201cBhadram\u201d. Hey, those of you who are fit\nto be worshipped, we have to see with our eyes that \u201cBhadram\u201d. Let us live as much as the Gods live\nwith healthy organs and healthy bodies praising and singing Him. 8\nHe is called \u201cMruthyu-Mruthyum [death and deathlessness]\u201d because just by mere thought of His\ndevotees, he destroys death and untimely death to them. He is one who gives the knowledge of the soul\nand also one who gives strength. All devas bow before Him and praise Him. Let us satisfy Him by\noffering Him \u201cHavis-food\u201d through the fire sacrifice because even his shadow is nectar and he is the\ndeath which destroys death. 9\nHe is worshipped by the chanting of \u201cNamami [I salute him]\u201d, because he is being worshipped by all\ndevas, all those who have forsaken his world and all those who swear by Brahmam and also because\nthe lord of the Vedas worship him telling these words. Indra, Mithra (Sun), Aryama and all other devas\nexist in him. 10\nI was born before this world which is pretty and orderly. I existed even before the devas. I am the\ncentral power of that which never dies. He who gives me (in my form as food for people) in charity,\nbecomes the one who protects the soul. If given without understanding this, I who am food, eat the one\nwho eats. I am the one who becomes all the world and destroys it. My light is like that of a sun, who\nstanding alone gives light to all the world. This Upanishad says that one who understands this attains\nsalvation. 11\nThe Third Upanishad\nThe devas requested Brahma to teach them the power of Anushtup Mantra Raja (The king of Chants set\nto anushtup meter) and also its root. Brahma told them:\nThis illusion (Maya) which is the power of Narasimha (which is EEm) is the one which creates\neverything, protects them and destroys them. Therefore you have to realize that this illusion is the\npower. The one who understands the power of this illusion, he crosses all sins and also attains\ndeathlessness. He enjoys the wealth with fame. The experts in Brahmam argue among themselves\nwhether this is short, long or extra long (Pronunciation?). One who pronounces this with short ending,\nwill burn away all sins and would attain deathlessness. He who pronounces this in long ending, would\nget wealth with fame and also attain deathlessness. He who pronounces it with extra long ending would\nattain ethereal knowledge and also deathlessness. What follows is the explanation given by sages:\n\n\u201cOh power behind EEm who is the personification of the power of illusion, please protect us. Please\nbless us so that we are able to cross easily in a straight forward manner this sea of birth and death.\nPeople who know you, call you also as Sreedevi, Lakshmi, Parvathy, Bhoodevi (The Goddess of\nEarth), Sashti Devi, Sree Vidhya and Indra Sena. Requesting you to give me long life, I submit myself\nto you who is the mother of all Vedas.\nAll the beings and things in the world were produced from the sky (Ether). All living things were made\nfrom the sky. They live in the sky. They go towards the sky and enter and disappear there. So we have\nto understand that the sky is the root (The root word for the sky is Ham).\u201d\nThe explanation given by sages are as follows:\n\u201cThat root \u201cHam\u201d is the Sun God traveling in the pure sky, in \u201cAir\u201d in the atmosphere, in \u201cFire\u201d in fire\nsacrifices, and exists as \u201cGuests\u201d in homes. That is the only one thing which is with devas and also\nwith men. It is the truth. It is that thing which is born out of sky, water, earth, sacrificial fire and\nmountains. This is the great truth. The Upanishad says that \u201conly the one who knows this knows the\nsecret implication of the mantra\u201d.\nFourth Upanishad\nThe devas approached Brahma and asked him to teach them about the branch (part) mantras of the\nNarasimha Mantra Raja. Brahma told them that they should know that the Pranava, Savithri, Yajur\nLakshmi and Narasimha Gayathri are the four parts (Branches) of Narasimha Mantra and also that any\none who knows this attains deathlessness.\n1. Pranavam is nothing but \u201cOm\u201d\n2. The Savithri Mantra which protects those who chant it is told in Yajur Veda. It has spread throughout\nthe world. The Savithri Ashtakshara (Eight letters) consists of the two letters \u201cGruni\u201d, the three letters,\n\u201cSoorya\u201d and the three letters \u201cAadhithya\u201d. This is a chant which increases your stature and your\nwealth. Great wealth will come in search of one who knows this.\n3. The Yajur Mahalakshmi Mantra is \u201cOm Bhoor Lakshmi, Bhuvar Lakshmi, Suva Kala Karni, Thanno\nLakshmi Prachodayath\u201d. This has 24 letters. All this universe is in the form of this Gayathri. So the one\nwho knows this Yajur Maha Lakshmi Mantra, would enjoy great wealth with lot of fame.\n4. The Narasimha Gayathri is, \u201cOm Nrusimhaya Vidhmahe Vajra Nakhaya Deemahi. Thannah Simha\nPrachodayath\u201d. This is the mantra in which all the Vedas and Devas reside. The one who knows this\nwould be the one with whom the Devas and Vedas will live forever.\nThe devas approached Brahma and asked him, \u201cBy chanting which Mantra, God will take great mercy\non us and give us a sight of His form. Please tell us about that.\u201d Then Brahma told them as follows:\n\u201cOm, Um, Om. Yo Vai Nirusimho Devo Bhagawan Yascha Brahma Thasmai Vo Namo Namah. Om\nKram Om. Yo Vai Nrusimho Devo Bhagwan Yascha Vishnu Thasmai Vai Namo Nama. Om Veem Om.\nYo Vai Nrusimho Devo Bhagwan Yascha Maheswara Thasmai Vai Namo Nama.\u201d\n[The 32 gods to whom similar mantra has to be prayed with Um-kram-Veem-Ram are Brahma, Vishnu,\nMaheswara Purusha, Eashwara, Saraswathi, Sree Gowri, Prakuthi, Vidhya, Omkara, Ardha mathra,\nVedhaa, Panchakhya, Saptha Vyahrudaya, Loka Pala, Vasava, Rudra, Aadhithya, Ashtou Gruha, Maha\n\nBhootha, Kaala, Manu, Mruthyu, Yama, Kandhaka, Paraana, Soorya, Soma, Virat Purusha, and Jeeva\nand in the end chant \u201cOm Ham, Om, Yo Vai Nrusimho Devo Bhagawan Yascha Sarvam Tasmai Vai\nNamo Nama.\u201d)\nBrahma told, \u201cIf One who prays God daily using these 32 mantras, God will become greatly pleased\nand would appear personally. So to any one who prays Bhagawan Narasimha using these mantras, He\nwould appear to him personally. That devotee would also see everything and attain deathlessness .Thus\ntells the great Upanishad.\u201d\nFifth Upanishad\nDevas approached Brahma and requested him, \u201cBhagawan, please tell us about the famous Chakra\ncalled Maha Chakra. The sages tell that \u201dIt is supposed to fulfill all the wishes and is the gateway to\nsalvation\u201d.\nLord Brahma told them:\n\u201cSudharshana (the holy wheel of Lord Vishnu) is that great Chakra. On its middle is written, the Taraka\nmantra (OM) and also the single letter of Narasimha (Kshroum), on its six petals of the Sudarshana six\nletters (Sahasrara Hum Phat) are written, on its eight petals the eight letters (Om Namo Narayanaya)\nare written, on its twelve petals is written the twelve holy letters (Om Namo Vasudevaya), on its sixteen\npetals, the mathruka (model) sixteen letters with their roots (Am Aam, Em, EEm\u2026. Aha) is written and\non its 32 petals are written the letters of the \u201cNarasimha Anushtup Mantra Raja.\u201d This is the\nSudarshana Chakra, This fulfills all ones wishes and is the gateway of salvation. It is a form of Yajur\nVeda, Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Brahmam and Amrutha (nectar).\nThe one who daily chants this \u201cNarasimha Anushtup Mantra Raja\u201c would be able to control fire,\ncontrol wind, control Sun, control moon, control water, control all devas, control all planets and control\npoison.\nRig Veda tells us about this, \u201cThe devotees who practice this would be able to see Lord Vishnu in the\nethereal sky, like an ordinary man is able to see the sun in the sky. The devotees who are Brahmins\nwould be able to praise the lighted Vishnu\u2019s form. The Upanishads tell that, this would be attained only\nby one who worships without any desire.\u201d\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Nrisimha Poorva Tapaniyopanishad, as contained in the Atharva-Veda.\n[Publisher's Note: Nrisimha Tapaniya Upanishad, listed as one of the 108 Upanishads in our version\n\nof Muktika Upanishad, has been shown as two Upanishads (Nrisimha Poorva Tapaniya Upanishad\nand Nrisimha Uttara Tapaniya Upanishad) in another version of Muktika Upanishad. Hence their\ntranslations are being provided here separately.]\n\nNrisimha Uttara Tapaniya Upanishad\nTranslated by P. R. Ramachander\nPublished by celextel.org\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nFirst Chapter\nDevas approached Lord Brahma and requested him, \u201cPlease teach us about the soul which is more\nminute than the atom and also about the letter \u201cOm\u201d. He said, \u201cSo be it\u201d and what he said was:\n\u201cAll this is the letter \u201cOm\u201d. What is past, what is present and what will be in future are its\ninterpretations. All these are Om. All these are Brahmam. This soul also is Brahmam. Joining this Atma\n(soul) with the Brahmam called Om and joining together the Brahmam and the soul, and realizing that\nthe birthless, deathless, nectar drenched and fearless Brahmam is nothing but the Om, and then putting\ntogether the three types of bodies and all these in to it and then making it our own so as to become one\nwith that and then destroy it. Continue to meditate that Om which is the soul with the three types of\nbodies and also the Parabrahmam with three types of bodies. This soul which is gross and enjoys mega\npleasures, which is also very minute and enjoys even the minutest pleasures and which becomes united\nand enjoys the pleasures of happiness, has four legs (branches).\nWhen it is awake its feelings are gross. It enjoys gross feelings with its seven organs and 19 faces (ten\nsense organs, five pranas, mind, brain, sensibility and ego). Its name is,Chaturathma Viswan (on the\nwhole) and Vaisvanaran (partly). This is its first leg.\nIn the state of dream, its feelings are very minute. It will enjoy this minute sense with its seven organs\nand nineteen faces. Its name is Chaturathma Thaijasan (on the whole) and also Hiranygarbhan (partly).\nThis is its second leg.\nWhere there is no desire and also where there are no dreams, that state is called Sushupthi. In that state,\none is single, personification of knowledge, having an endless form, one who enjoys happiness and\nsteadfastly concentrates only on knowledge. His name is Chaturathma Pragnan (knower). This is the\nthird leg (aspect). He alone is Lord of all beings, one who knows everything, one who resides in\neverything, one who is the root cause of everything and one where all beings which were born meet\ntheir end. These three involving Sushupthi and Swapna are only illusions. Soul is the only form which\n\nis real.\nThe fourth feet (aspect) of this four fold soul is Thureeya. It is something which make all others act,\nsomething which is within everything and it is the active essence beyond Jagrat (awakening), Sushupthi\n(sleep) and Swapna(dream). Something about it is as follows: It is without macro consciousness. It is\nwithout micro consciousness. It is without medium consciousness. It is the personification of\nconsciousness. It is not something immobile and it is not immobile consciousness. It cannot be seen. It\ncannot be described. It cannot be understood. It is something without any identification. It is something\nwhich is unimaginable. It is something which cannot be pointed out. It is something which can be\nperceived only with the firm belief that there is only one soul. It is that aspect of Pancha Boothas (Five\nelements viz earth, air, fire, water and ether), where the entire universe is crashed in. It is considered as\nthe fourth state after Shiva (peace), Santha (inner peace without any negative activity), and Advaita (the\nconcept of non dualism). It is the soul. It is that thing which has to be understood. It is that aspect of\nGod, which is the knowledge beyond all knowledge and is called Thuriya Thuriyam.\nSecond Chapter\nThe four branches of Brahmam, which is Shining well, is full of same essence of happiness, is never\naging, is never dying, is full of nectar and which is providing protection, should be matched with the\nfour letters (branches) of Om. The one who knows, that the Chaturathma Viswan (on the whole) and\nVaiswanaran (partly) who are awake and have similarity to the four formed Aakara (letter Aa), are\nspread inside everything in the form of Sthoola (macro), Sookshma (micro), Bheeja (root) and Sakshi\n(witness) and are the first of everything, would realize all his wishes. He would be the first among\nevery one.\nThe Chaturathma Thaijasan (on the whole) and Hiranya Garbhan (partly) who exist in the state of\ndreams are similar to the four formed letter Uu. This Uu has the form of gross, micro, root and witness.\nBecause of its greatness and because of its double relation, the one who knows this through gross,\nmicro, root and witness aspects would increase the tide of knowledge. He would possess equanimity\nalong with pleasure and pain.\nThe Chaturathma Pragnan (on the whole) and Easwaran (partly), who are in the state of sleep, are\nsimilar to the four formed letter Ma. This letter Ma also has the forms of gross, micro, root and witness.\nThe one who knows this in its aspect of its measurability and its capacity to hide it in itself by macro,\nmicro, root and witness properties, would be able to measure the entire world by his wisdom and would\nbe able to hide everything within himself.\nLike this we have to pray on the stages of wakefulness, sleep and dream by the Aa, Uu, and Ma letters\nof Om. The fourth letter is the one which has within itself the Easwara. It is that which can rule by\nitself, it is itself Easwara and it has a self glitter. This soul which is the fourth, exists as known and\nunknown among all beings. Its light is like the Kalagni Surya (sun who is like a fire causing death) at\nthe time of the final deluge. It gives to all, itself as soul and would make everything in to itself. Like the\nSun which swallows darkness, this soul which is the unified power, exists like fire which remains\ndetached after burning the fuel, beyond word and mind and has a holy divine form and is the Thuriya.\nThis is the Om. It is within everything which has a name and form, and is the knowledge and the\nknower. Because it exists as Thuriya and has a divine form and is within everything as knowledge and\nthe knower and is detached and formless, there are no differences within it. And so the teaching\nregarding this is as follows:\n\nBecause it is without syllable, it is peace (Shiva), it is the place where universe meets the end, it is\nindescribable, it has a non dualistic form and is placed in the fourth position, and it is \u201cOm\u201d itself. The\nsoul, who understands this in this manner, would attain the soul himself.\nThis valorous hero would understand Thuriya using the Narsaimha Anushtup Mantra Raja. This would\nmake the soul shine. He should deeply meditate on Brahmam as something which would destroy\neverything, which cannot be conquered by any one, which is everywhere, which shines for ever, which\nis devoid of ignorance, which is able to cut off his own bondage, which is non dual, which is\npersonification of happiness, which is the basis for everything, which exists for ever and which is one\nwithout ignorance, passion and base qualities.\nThird Chapter\nMeditate deeply on Pranava (Om) in the form of Chidagni (The fire within) which is in Agni Mandala\n(Orbit of fire) of the Mooladhara, in the Maha Peeta (consisting of 4, 7 and 32 petal lotus) with its\nfamily of four worlds (Earth, atmosphere, heavens and moon world) and seven souls (Loka-VedaDevatha-Gana-Chanda-Agni-Vyahruthi). Then meditate on letter Aa which is the Chaturathma (4 souls)\nand the Sapthathma (seven souls) as Brahma in the belly (Mani Pooraka), on letter Uu as Vishnu in the\nheart (Aanahatha), on letter Ma as Rudra in the middle of eyelids (Aagna), on the dot which is the\nhappy nectar form of the soul of Omkara (Sound of Om) in Dwadasantha (just above the eyes) and the\nsoul (Athma) in the form of sound in Shodasantha. Thus after worshipping with nectar (Ananda\nAmrutha) the four fold Brahmas (Devatha, Teacher, Mantra and the soul), Vishnu, Rudra separately and\nthen together in the form of Linga with offerings and then unifying the linga forms in the Atma Jyothi\n(Light of the soul) and filling up the macro, micro and causal bodies with this light, we have to unify\nAtma Jyothi which is their basis with macro, micro, root and witness properties. Afterwards adjust the\nvery gross Virat form in the very micro Hiranyagarbha form, and this micro form in the great causal\nIswara form and after arranging the mantras similarly, and meditating on \u201cOtha-Anuj-Jnathru-AnugnaAvikalpa\u201d stages, and merging all this in to the Omkara (sound of Om) in Thuriya, we have to reach the\nNirvikalpa Paramathma (formless great truth).\nFourth Chapter\nThus the soul should be meditated upon nine times as the Omkara form of Para Brahma with thuriya\npranava sound. Using anushtup mantra as the ever happy full Atma starting with the chants \u201cOm\nUgram, Sachidananda Poorna-Prathyag-Sadathmanam, Nrusimham Pramathmanam Param Brahma\nChinthayami\u201d and ending with \u201cOm Mruthyum Mruthyum\u2026.\u201d. Then the same prayer nine times with\nChidathmanam instead of Sadathmanam. Then the same prayer 9 times with Anandathmanam instead\nof Sadathmanam. Then the same prayer 9 times with Poornathmanam instead of Sadathmanam and\nagain the same prayer with Pratyagathmanam instead of Sadathmanam. Meditating well on the five\nforms of Sath, Chit, Ananda, Poorna and Atma and pray with the Navathmaka mantras and then\nmeditate on the soul using \u201cAham (self)\u201d, then salute and then unite yourself with Brahmam. [Example\nfor mantras of Namaskara (saluting) \u201cOm Ugram Sachidananda Poorna Prathyag Sadathmanam\n(substitute Chidathmanam etc) Nrusimham Paramathmanam Param Brahma Aham Namami.\u201d]\nThe other alternative is to pray Lord Narasimha using the Anushtup Mantra. He (Narasimha) who is\nGod exists as a human being and also as soul of every one for all times and every where, and also as\none who destroys attachments and also as God of the universe. He is the soul of Thuriya. Believing he\nis yourself, the one who practices yoga should meditate on the Omkara Brahmam.\n\nHe is the great sage who serves God, who establishes the lion with its fame, after mutually attracting\nViswa, Thaijasa and Pragna who are like the sons of Atma with Pranava which has been pointed out as\nthe bull of Vedas, after making them without separate identity and finishing them in Sakshi Chaithanya\nand afterwards kill the darkness of ignorance using the fame of the lion.\nThat devotee who after saluting Virat, Hiranya Garbha and Easwara who have been joined in the horns\nof Pranava and uniting them in the same Paramatma principle and then saluting Narasimha as described\nabove and make him personally present by methods like Ugra (Very angry) and Veera (great hero),\nwould exist in the form similar to Narasimha.\nFifth Chapter\nThat type of practitioner would not have any desire towards worldly things, would have all his earlier\ndesires fulfilled and would have desire only on Atma (soul). His Pranas (soul spirits) do not start and go\nany where and would attain their ultimate here itself in Brahmam. He exists as Brahmam and attains\nBrahmam. He who worships the exalted Atma in Omkara (the letter Om), attains Brahmam in the form\nof Narasimham.\nHe who meditates and venerates the ultimate God in the form of Aa, Uu and Ma, which is\nincomparable, which is the holy spirit, which sees every thing, which is the witness of everything,\nwhich swallows everything, which is the darling of every body, which is prior to everything and which\nmakes everything else shine, would understand and know Para Brahma. One who knows like that\nwould shine as God Para Brahma Narasimha.\nSixth Chapter\nDevas wanted to understand this Atma (soul). The Asura qualities caught hold of them. To get rid of\nthat effect, they worshipped Narasimha who is the Thuriya soul which is in the summit of Omkara\nusing the Anushtup Mantra. Then the sin like Asura qualities itself became the great light of wisdom\nwhich is the prime happiness (like poison becoming medicine). Those devas became mentally calm,\nhaving their sensory organs under control, became those who were not attracted by worldly desires,\nbecame those having patience, became those whose conduct became stable, became those who were\nattracted by the Atma, became those who were having playfulness, unity and happiness, and became\nthose who realized that \u201cOm\u201d is \u201clight of Atma which is Para Brahmam\u201d, and felt that all other places\nare empty and merged in to the \u201cOm\u201d. So the practitioner should do penance like devas, stabilize his\nmind in the Omkara Para Brahmam, and would make other people see his Atma as Para Brahmam.\nThere is a holy stanza about this viz. \u201cAfter meditating on the horns which are the different parts of\nPranava and further meditating on the Thuriya Paramatma which is a horn but not a part, add the\nNrusimha Raja Mantra to the different parts of Pranava.\" The three types of Devas(Sathvika, Rajasa\nand Thamasa) serve the pranava in which, the first two letters (Aa and Uu) are merged and fixed in the\nthird letter Ma and make themselves exalted.\nSeventh Chapter\nAdding the first half of the Uu with the letter Aa, and making it as the form of Lord Narasimha, and\nthen using the second half of letter Uu on Narasimha Brahma because it is macro, because it is shining,\nbecause it is famous, because it is Mahadeva (great God), because he is Maheswara (Greatest God),\nbecause it is the best Sathva (sathvic quality), because it is the greatest wisdom, because it is the\ngreatest happiness, and because it is the greatest lord, then unite it with soul which is the meaning of\n\nthe letter Ma. One who knows this, would be without a body, without sensory organs, without soul,\nwithout ignorance, with the form of Sat Chit Ananda (ever lasting bliss) and would become as one who\nattained salvation (one who attains Swarajya).\nTherefore one has to meditate on Para Brahma with the letter Aa, cross the mind with letter Ma and\nsearch for that state where one is the witness of the mind. When one pushes out everything, then\neverything enters in and when he attains awakening of wisdom, then everything rises from him. Thus if\none meditates, catch it, set fire and swallow, he would become Narasimha who is of the form of Atma\nand would establish himself in his own power. There is a holy stanza about this. Its meaning is like this:\nJoin Aa the first letter of Pranava, with the first part of its second letter Uu, and join these together with\nletter Ma and merge it with Thuriya Brahma which is the meaning of Pranava and is a witness beyond\nthe states of waking sleep and dream.\nEighth Chapter\nHis soul is woven completely from side to side with thuriya. This with its Narasimha form, and in\nwhich every thing pervades and which is the soul of everything, contains everything. This is the secret\nand is without form or seed. This soul is non dualistic and without form or seed. The word \u201cOm\u201d is non\ndualistic and is full of wisdom. (Narasimha, the soul of thuriya and the meaning of Omkara are all the\nsame. They swallow everything). This is the unique body of Parameshwara (lord of every thing). This\nis without form or seed. This which does not have any form or seed, does not have differences within.\nThe one who thinks that there is difference between them, breaks into hundred pieces and breaks in to\nthousand pieces and attains death from death. This is without a two, self resplendent and great joy. That\nsoul is the ultimate support. It is Brahmam. Brahmam is the ultimate support. The one who knows this\nbecomes Brahmam which is the ultimate support.\nNinth Chapter\nDevas approached Prajapathi and requested him, \u201cOh God, please tell us about the Omkaratma (the\nletter Om which is the soul). He agreed and told them:\nAtma stands behind and observes and is with you as a witness. It is lion, a form beyond thought, a form\nwithout feelings and something which can be attained from every where. There is nothing second to it,\nwhich is separate from that. It is the Atma which is ready everywhere. Due to the illusion this Atma\nappears as something different. From Pragna, due to the cover of ignorance, the world is produced. For\nthe living being, Atma is the resplendent Paramatma. Because the sensory organs are not able to feel it,\nit is not known, even when it is known.\nPrajapathi told devas, \u201csee that Atma which is resplendent and without second, which is before you, as,\n\u201cI am it and it is me\u201d. Has it been seen?\u201d\nDevas replied, \u201cYes, it has been seen. It is beyond things which are known and things which are not\nknown. Where has illusion gone now? How did illusion disappear?\u201d\nPrajapathi told them, \u201cIt is not surprising that the illusion has disappeared. Because you are all people\nwith a wonderful form. There is nothing surprising even in that. That form of the soul is natural to you\nall. Understand that is the form of \u201cOm\u201d. You now tell me what you have understood.\u201d\nThey said, \u201cit appears as if we have understood it and also appears as if that we have not understood it.\n\nIt also appears as if it is beyond all description\u201d.\nPrajapathi told them, \u201cYou have now got the knowledge about the soul\u201d.\nThey told him, \u201cOh, God, we are seeing it but we are not seeing it, like we see other things. We do not\nhave capacity to describe it. Oh, God salutations to you. Please shower your grace on us.\u201d\nPrajapathi told them, \u201cIf you want to know any thing more, please ask me. Ask without fear.\u201d\nThey told, \u201cThis knowledge about the soul is a great blessing. Our salutations to you.\u201d\nThus Prajapathi taught them. There is a stanza about it: \u201cUnderstand that Atma which is spread\neverywhere by the practice of Om. Understand that, the Atma which does not have any thing which is\ndifferent and which is in you as the knower, is very much within you. After understanding that stabilize\nthere, as a witness who advises\".\nOm !

    "Kalagnirudra": "[Publisher's Note: Nrisimha Tapaniya Upanishad, listed as one of the 108 Upanishads in our version\nof Muktika Upanishad, has been shown as two Upanishads (Nrisimha Poorva Tapaniya Upanishad\nand Nrisimha Uttara Tapaniya Upanishad) in another version of Muktika Upanishad.

May he give us both (enough) to enjoy!\nEfficiency may we both attain! Effective may our study prove! May we not hate (each other) at all!\nOm Shanti! Shanti! Shanti!\nOnce it happened that Sanat Kumara asked the exalted Kalagnirudra: \u201cTeach me O exalted Sir! the\ntruth in respect to the rule of the Tripundram (a sect mark consisting of three streaks) and what\nmaterial, which place, how much, of what extent and which streaks, which divinity, which formula,\nwhich powers and which reward there are?\u201d\nThe exalted one said to him \u201cThe material should be the ash of fires. One should grasp it with the five\nBrahman-formulas (Sathyojatam, Vamadevam, Agoram, Rudram, Eesanam). Consecrate it with the\nformula \u201cAgnir iti bhasma\u201d etc., Take out with the formula \u201cma nas toke tanayae\u201d and (after\nconsecrating) with the formula \u201cTrayambakam Yajamahe\u201d should apply it as three lines across on the\nhead, forehead, breast and shoulders under the tryayusa formulas, trayambaka formulas and trisakti\nformulas.\nThis is the Sambhu-vow, which is taught in all the Vedas by those versed in the Veda. Therefore one\ndesirous of liberation should practise it, so that he is not born again. And this O! Sanat kumara, is its (of\nthe mark) extent; it stretches threefold from the forehead down to the eyes and goes from the center of\none eye-brow to the other.\nIts first line is the Grahapatya fire, the a-sound (of AUM), the Rajas (forceful characteristic), the\nterrestrial world, the external atman, the acting power, the Rig Veda, the morning pressing (of the Soma\nJuice), and Maheswara is its divinity.\nIts second line is the Dakshina fire, the u-sound, the Sattvam (peaceful characteristic), the atmosphere,\n\nthe inner Atman, the willing power, the Yajur Veda, the midday pressing of the Soma and Sadasiva is its\ndivinity.\nIts third line is the Ahavaniya fire, the m-sound, the Tamas (lazy characteristic), the heaven, the highest\nAtman, the perceiving power, the SamaVeda, the evening pressing of the Soma and Siva is its divinity.\nTherefore he makes the Tripundram from the ashes. He who knows this, whether he be a Brahmanstudent, a house holder, a forest-resident or an ascetic, he is thereby purified of all the major sins and\nminor sins. Thereby all the gods are meditated upon by him, he is known by all the gods, becomes one\nwho has bathed in all the holy bathing places, one who has all the time muttered the Rudra prayer. And\nafter enjoying all the pleasures he enters, giving up the body, into union with Siva and does not return \u2013\nand does not return.\nThus spoke the exalted Kalagni Rudra. One who recites it here, he also attains to a similar state. Om\nSatyam. \u2013 Thus reads the Upanishad.\nOM! May Brahman protect us (the Guru and Sishya) both! May he give us both (enough) to enjoy!\nEfficiency may we both attain! Effective may our study prove! May we not hate (each other) at all!\nOm Shanti! Shanti! Shanti!\nOm !

    "Maitreya": "\nMaitreya Upanishad\nTranslated by Prof. A. A. Ramanathan\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm !

The King, Brihadratha by name, had his eldest son installed on the throne and considering the body\nto be impermanent and feeling disgusted (with worldly life) went to a (penance) forest. There he\nperformed the highest kind of penance and facing the sun remained with his arm uplifted. At the end of\na thousand years the sun-god (taking the form of the sage Sakayanya) approached the sage. Like fire\n(blazing) without smoke and burning all as it were with his effulgence the sage Sakayanya, the knower\nof the Self, said to the king: \u2018Rise up, rise up, choose a boon\u2019. Bowing to him the king said: \u2018Revered\nSir, I know not the Atman. But we hear that you are a knower of the truth. Expound to me that\u2019. \u2018This\nrequest of yours is impossible on the very face of it. Do not ask me this question. Oh descendant of\nIkshvaku, choose (the fulfilment of) other desires\u2019. Reverently touching the feet of the sage Sakayanya\nthe king gave utterance to the following religious text (Gatha).\nI-2. Now then why speak of other things ? (There is) the drying up of great seas, the downfall of\nmountains, the movement of the polestar or of trees, the submerging of the earth and the loss of\nposition by the gods. In this worldly life which is of the nature of (distinction between) \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019,\nwhat is the use of enjoying desires as, resorting to them, there is seen the repeated return (to the\nphenomenal world) ? Hence it behoves on your part to uplift me. I am like a frog in a well in this\n\nworldly life. Revered Sir, you are my refuge\u2019. Thus (the king said).\nI-3. Revered Sir, this body is born of sexual union alone, is devoid of consciousness and is verily hell\nas it has emerged through the urinal path, full of bones, daubed with flesh and encased in skin; it is\nfully filled with faeces, urine, wind, bile, phlegm, marrow, fat, fatty exudations and many other filthy\nthings. Remaining in a body of this kind, revered Sir, you are my refuge. Thus (he implored).\nI-4. Then the revered sage Sakayanya greatly pleased, said to the king: \u2018Great king Brihadratha, you are\nprominent in the family of the Ikshvakus, a knower of the Atman, one who has done his duty well and\nyou are well known by the name of Marut. Such is your Self. Revered Sir, who is to be described ? And\nhe said to the king:\nI-5. The objects such as those denoted by sound and touch are apparently (a source of) danger; for the\nindividual self (encased in the five elements) may not remember the highest goal when attached to\nthem.\nI-6. Through penance one gets to know the inborn disposition (Sattva); from Sattva one gets (stability\nof) the mind; through the mind one realizes the Atman; by realizing the Self (worldly life is) prevented.\nI-7. Just as fire, when fuel is exhausted, calms down in itself, so the mind, when its activity is\nexhausted, becomes quiescent in its source (i.e. in the Self).\nI-8. When the mind is calmed down into its source and goes in the true path, the results dependent on\nactivities are unreal as the objects of the senses are confounded (i.e. actions performed do not affect\nhim as he is without attachment).\nI-9. It is the mind that constitutes worldly life; this should be purified. As the mind, so the things appear\ncoloured by it; this is the eternal secret.\nI-10. By the purity of the mind one destroys (the effect of) good and bad actions. When with a pure\nmind one remains in the Self one enjoys inexhaustible bliss.\nI-11. If a person\u2019s mind, which is well attached to the region of the sense-objects, were turned towards\nBrahman, who will not be released from bondage ?\nI-12-14. One should feel the supreme Lord to be present in the midst of the lotus of one\u2019s heart as the\nspectator of the dance of the intellect, as the abode of supreme love, as beyond the range of mind and\nspeech, as he rescue ship scattering all worry (of those sinking in the sea of worldly life), as of the\nnature of effulgent Existence alone, as beyond thought, as the indispensable, as incapable of being\ngrasped by the (active) mind, possessing uncommon attributes, the immobile, steady and deep, neither\nlight nor darkness, free from all doubts and semblance, and is consciousness consisting of the final\nbeatitude.\nI-15. That which is the eternal, the pure, the ever vigilant, free from the nature (of delusions), the true,\nthe subtle, the supremely powerful, the one without a second, the ocean of bliss and transcendent, that I\nam, the innermost essence (of all); there is no doubt about it.\nI-16. How can the danger (of duality) approach me, resorting as I do to the inner bliss of the Self, who\ndespise the female goblin of desires, who view the phenomenal world as in illusion and who am\nunattached to it ?\nI-17. Those ignorant people who stick to castes and orders of life obtain the (worthless) fruit of their\nrespective actions. Those who discard the ways of caste, etc., and are happy with the bliss of the Self\nbecome merged in Brahman (lit. Purushas).\nI-18. The body consisting of various limbs and observing the (rules of) castes and orders has a\nbeginning and an end and is only a great trouble. Free of attachment to one\u2019s children, etc., and the\nbody, one should live in the endless supreme happiness.\nII-1. Then the revered sage Maitreya went to Kailasa. Approaching him (the Lord) he said: \u2018Lord,\nexpound to me the secret of the supreme Truth\u2019. The great god said to him:\nII-2. The body is said to be the temple; the individual Self (Jiva) is Shiva alone. One should discard the\nfaded flowers in the form of spiritual ignorance and worship God (with the conviction) \u2018He and I are\n\none\u2019.\nII-3. True knowledge consists of seeing non-different (in all); deep meditation consists of the mind\nfreed from thinking on sensory objects; bathing is the removal of impurity in the mind and cleansing\nconsists of controlling the senses.\nII-4. He should imbibe the nectar, Brahman, go about for alms to preserve the body, and becoming\ndevoted to the one (Brahman) live in the solitary place of oneness free from duality. Thus should a wise\nman spend his life; he alone will attain liberation.\nII-5. This body is born and it has death; it has originated from the impure secretions of the mother and\nfather; it is the abode of joy and sorrow and it is impure. Bathing in the form of discarding attachment\nto it is ordained when one touches it with the idea that it belongs to one.\nII-6. It is built up of primary fluids, subject to grievous maladies, abode of sinful actions, transitory and\ndiffused with agitated feelings. Touching this body, bathing (as aforesaid) is ordained.\nII-7. It always naturally exudes at the appropriate time impure secretions through the nine apertures\n(eyes, ears, etc.,). Having impure matter it smells foul. Touching this, bathing (as aforesaid) is ordained.\nII-8. It is associated with the mother in impurity at birth and is born with the impurity caused by childbirth; as it is born associated with death (in due course) and the impurity caused by child birth,\ntouching this body, bathing (as aforesaid) is ordained.\nII-9. Viewing the body as \u2018I\u2019 and mine is smearing oneself with faeces and urine in the place of\ncosmetics. Thus pure cleansing has been spoken of (in the verses above). Cleansing (the body) with\nmud and water is (the external one) practised in the world.\nII-10. Cleansing which purifies the mind consists of the destruction of the three inborn tendencies\n(loka-vasana, shastra-vasana and deha-vasana); (real) cleansing is said to be by washing with mud and\nwater in the form of (true) knowledge and dispassion (Jnana and Vairagya).\nII-11. Feeling of non-duality is the alms (which is consumed) and the feeling of duality is the thing\nunfit for consumption. The receiving of alms by the mendicant monk is ordained in accordance with\nthe directions of the Guru and the scripture.\nII-12. After embracing renunciation of his own accord the wise man shall move away from his native\nplace and live far away, like a thief who has been released from prison.\nII-13. No sooner has (the ascetic) moved away from the son of ego, the brother of wealth, the home of\ndelusion and the wife of desires than he is liberated (from worldly bondage); there is no doubt about it.\nII-14-15. How shall I perform the twilight worship (Sandhya, i.e., there is no need for it) when the\nmother of delusion is (just) dead and the son of true awakening is born, causing two-fold impurity ?\nHow can I perform twilight worship when the bright sun of consciousness ever shines in the sky of the\nheart and it never sets or rises ? (i.e. there is no twilight at all and hence there is no scope for worship).\nII-16. The conviction, which is present from the words of the Guru that there is only one (reality)\nwithout a second, alone is the solitude (necessary for meditation) and not a monastery nor the interior\nof a forest.\nII-17. There is liberation for those who are free from doubts; there is no emancipation even at the end\nof repeated births for those whose minds are invaded by doubts (about the non-duality of the Atman).\nHence one should have faith.\nII-18. There is no (true) renunciation by discarding action, nor by reciting the mantras of Praisa (at the\nformal ceremony of renunciation). Renunciation has been declared to be the oneness of the individual\nself (Jiva) and the universal Self (Atman).\nII-19. One, to whom all primary desires, etc., (such as for wife, wealth and progeny) appear like vomit\nand who has discarded pride in his body, is entitled to renunciation.\nII-20. A wise man should embrace renunciation only when there has risen in his mind dispassion for all\nworldly things; otherwise he is fallen.\nII-21. He who renounces worldly life for amassing wealth (contributed by rich disciples) or for the sake\nof (assured) boarding and clothing or for a stable position (as the head of a monastery) is doubly fallen\n\n(i.e. he has neither the full pleasures of worldly life nor liberation); he does not deserve final beatitude.\nII-22. The wisest take to contemplation on the reality (of Brahman); the middling ones contemplate on\nthe scripture; low people think of the mantras; the lowest are deluded by (the efficacy) of holy places.\nII-23. A fool in vain takes (theoretical) delight in Brahman without practically experiencing it (as I am\nBrahman), like the joy of tasting fruits found in the branch of a tree reflected (in a lake).\nII-24. If a sage does not give up \u2013 the inward (conviction of non-duality in) the collecting of alms from\nvarious houses as a bee does honey from flowers, the father in the form of dispassion, the wife of faith\nand the son of true knowledge, he is liberated.\nII-25. People rich in wealth, old in age and similarly those mature in knowledge \u2013 all these are (but)\nservants, (nay) the servants of the disciples of those who are mature in wisdom.\nII-26. Even learned people have their minds deluded by the illusion created by me and without\nrealizing me, the Atman, who am omnipresent, they but wander like cows to fill the wretched belly !\nII-27. To one desiring liberation worship of idols made of stone, metal, gem and clay results only in the\nexperience of rebirth; hence the sage should perform the worship of his heart alone (i.e. contemplate on\nBrahman enshrined in his heart, non-different from the Self). To prevent rebirth he shall avoid external\nworship (of idols).\nII-28. He who is full inwardly and outwardly is like a jar filled in the sea; he who is empty inwardly\nand empty outwardly is like a jar empty in the sky.\nII-29. Do not become one enjoying objects (of the senses), do not also become one believing in the\nsenses. Rejecting all ideations, become that which remains.\nII-30. Discarding (ideas of) seer, seeing and what is seen along with inward tendencies, may you resort\nonly to the Atman who is the prime source of all phenomena.\nII-31. That state of remaining like a stone with all ideations quiescent and freed from the states of\nwaking and sleeping is the supreme state of the Self (in the disembodied state).\nThus (ends the instruction given by Lord Shiva and the second chapter).\nIII-1. I am I, I am the other (the supreme one), I am Brahman, I am the source (of all), I am also the\nGuru of all the worlds, I am all the worlds, That I am.\nIII-2. I alone am, I have attained perfection, I am pure, I am the supreme, I remain always, I am He, I\nam eternal, I am pure.\nIII-3. I am the true knowledge (Vijnana), I am the special one, I am Soma, I am the all. I am the\nauspicious one, I am free from sorrow, I am consciousness, I am the impartial one.\nIII-4. I am devoid of honour and dishonour, I am without attributes, I am Shiva, I am free from duality\nand non-duality, I am free from the pairs (of opposites), I am He.\nIII-5. I am devoid of being and non-being, I am beyond speech, I am effulgence, I am the power of the\nvoid and the non-void and I am the auspicious and the inauspicious (i.e. beyond both of them).\nIII-6. I am devoid of the equal and the unequal, eternal, pure, ever auspicious; I am free of all and the\nnon-all, I am the righteous and I ever remain.\nIII-7. I am beyond the number one and I am beyond the number two as well. I am above the distinction\nof good and bad and I am devoid of ideation.\nIII-8. I am free from the distinction of many souls, being of the form of unalloyed bliss. I am not\n(existent as an entity), I am not another, I am devoid of the body etc.,\nIII-9. I am free from the concept of substratum and that of the object resting on it; I am devoid of a\nprop. I am above captivity and liberation, I am the pure Brahman, I am He.\nIII-10. I am devoid of all things such as the mind, I am the supreme, greater than the great. I am always\nof the form of investigation, I am free from investigation. I am He.\nIII-11. I am of the form of the letter \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018u\u2019 and I am the letter \u2018m\u2019 which (as Om) is eternal. I am\nfree from meditation and being a meditator, I am beyond the object of meditation, I am He.\nIII-12. I am of the form which fills everything, possessing the characteristics of Existence,\n\nConsciousness and Bliss. I am of the form of all holy places, I am the supreme Atman, I am Shiva.\nIII-13. I am devoid of aim and non-aim and I am the bliss 9rasa0 which has no extinction. I am beyond\nmeasurer and measure and the thing measured; I am Shiva.\nIII-14. I am not the world, I witness all and I am devoid of eyes, etc., I am immense, I am awake, I am\nserene and I am Hara (Shiva).\nIII-15. I am devoid of all the senses and I do all actions. I am the (object of) satisfaction to all the\nUpanishads, I am always easily accessible (to the devoted).\nIII-16. I am joy (to the devoted) and sorrow (to the careless), I am the friend of all silence. I am always\nof the form of consciousness and I am always of the form of Existence and Consciousness.\nIII-17. I am not devoid of even the least, nor am I a little. I am without the knot of the heart (i.e.\npartiality due to affection) and I abode in the midst of the lotus of the heart.\nIII-18. I am devoid of the six changes (of birth, etc.,), I am without the six sheaths (the gross material\nbody, etc.,); I am free from the group of six (internal) enemies (passions, etc.,) and I am the witness,\nbeing the supreme God.\nIII-19. I am free of space and time, I am the bliss of the principal unclad sages, I am beyond \u2018there is\u2019\nand \u2018there is not\u2019 and I am devoid of all negation (i.e. I am pure Existence without a counterpart).\nIII-20. I am of the form of unbroken ether and I am of omnipresent form. I am the mind (chitta) free\nfrom the phenomenal world and I am devoid of the phenomenal world.\nIII-21. I am of the form of all effulgence, I am the effulgence of pure consciousness. I am beyond the\nthree durations (past, present and future) and I am free from passion, etc.\nIII-22. I am above the body and its dweller and I am unique, devoid of attributes. I am beyond\nliberation, I am liberated and I am always devoid of final emancipation.\nIII-23. I am above truth and untruth, I am always nothing other than pure Existence. I am not obliged to\ngo to any place, being free of movement, etc.\nIII-24. I am always equanimous, I am quiescence, the greatest being (Purushottama); one who has his\nown experience thus is without doubt myself. He who listens to this (experience) even once (with\nsupreme faith) becomes himself (i.e. becomes merged into) Brahman. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm !

The Unqualified Brahman: They say \u2013 \u2018What existed ?\u2019 He replied \u2018Neither the existent nor the\nnon-existent. From that Tamas was born; from Tamas was born Bhitadi (Prakriti \u2013 Matter), from it\nspace, from space air, from air fire, from fire water and from water earth.\nThis became the Egg; which existing for just a year became two-fold \u2013 earth below and sky above.\nBetween was Divine Man with a thousand heads, eyes, feet and arms (Virat-purusha).\n4-6. He at first created the death of all creatures, having three eyes, heads and feet, armed with an axe.\nBrahma was afraid \u2013 he entered Brahma himself, he created seven mental sons \u2013 they created seven\nVirats, the pro-creators.\nHis face was Brahmana, arms were made into Kshatriya, thighs became the Vaishya, Sudra was born\nfrom the feet, air and vital air (Prana) from his ear, all this is from his heart.\nThus the First Section\n1. From the Apana were created Nisadas, Yakshas etc., from the bones mountains, from the hair plants\nand trees, from the forehead Rudra (of anger).\n2. The breath of this great being became Rik and other Vedas, phonetics, kalpa (the manual of ritual),\ngrammar, etymology, metre, logic, astronomy, exegetic, law, comments, glosses etc.\n3. The golden light in which dwell the self, all worlds made itself into two \u2013 woman and man.\nBecoming Deva created Devas, becoming Rishi created Rishis, also Yakshas etc., as well as wild as\n\nwild and domestic animals, bull and cow, horse and mare, male and female donkey, earth and the boar.\n4. At the end, becoming Vaisvanara (fire), he burned (destroyed) all creatures \u2013 earth was absorbed in\nwater, water in fire, fire in air, air in ether, ether in sense organs, they in subtle elements, they in\nPrakriti, Prakriti in Mahat, Mahat in Avyakta, Avyakta in Akshara, Akshara in Tamas, it in God. Then\nthere is neither existent nor non-existent. This is the doctrine of dissolution (as given in) Vedas.\nThus the Second Section\nLESSON TWO: THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE\n1. In the beginning, this was non-existent. The man of wisdom does grow, meditating upon the Atman\nwhich has no birth, no rising, nor setting, unestablished, having no sound, touch, form, taste, smell,\ndecay nor any thing bigger.\n2. Without vital breath, face, ears, speech, mind, radiance, eyes, name, lineage, head, hands or feet,\nsmoothness, blood, measurability, neither long, short nor gross, nor atomic, shoreless, beyond\ndescription, not open, nor illuminable, nor closed, without inside or outside; it neither eats nor is eaten.\n3. One can achieve (realize) this only by means of truth, charity, undying austerity, celibacy,\ndetachment with six parts. He shall observe the three, self control, munificence and compassion. His\nvital airs do not depart but merge here in Brahman.\nThus the Third Section\n1. In the midst of the heart, is a mass of red flesh in which is the Dahara of Lotus (in shape),\nblossoming in many ways like lily \u2013 there are ten holes in the heart where the vital airs are established.\n2. When the (Jiva) is connected with Prana, then he sees rivers and cities of many kinds; when with\nVyana, he sees Devas and Rishis; with Apana, Yakshas etc.; with Udana, the celestial worlds, gods,\nSkanda and Jayanta; with Samana, wealth also; with Vairambha (Prana) sees what is seen, heard, eaten\nand not eaten, visible and invisible.\n3. Then these Nadis become hundred; from these, branch out seventy two thousand Nadis, in which the\nself sleeps and makes noises, in the second sheath he sleeps and sees this world and the other, hears all\nsounds \u2013 this they call clarity. Prana defends the body. The Nadis are filled with green, blue, yellow, red\nand white blood.\n4. This Dahara lotus is blooming in many ways like a lily and like hair, so also the Nadis are placed in\nthe heart. The divine self sleeps in the great sheath when there are no desires, no sleep even, there are\nno Devas or their worlds, Yagas, Mother, Father, kinsmen, no thieves or Brahmana-killer. All this is\nwater \u2013 Again by the same path, he returns to wakefulness, this Samraj.\nThus the Fourth Section\n1. The supreme being assigns places to their owners \u2013 the Nadi is their link. The eye is the owner in the\nbody amidst the elements \u2013 what is seen in the divinity \u2013 the artery is the link. He that is in the eye, in\nthe sun, artery, vital air, knowledge, bliss, heart\u2019s sky \u2013 he that moves inside all these is the self.\nMeditate on that self that is ageless, deathless, fearless, endless.\n2. The ear is the owner in the body amidst the elements, (the guardians of) the quarters the deity, the\nartery is the link. He that is in the ear, audible objects, in the quarters etc., -- he that moves inside all\nthis is the self. Meditate on that self who is ageless, deathless, fearless, painless, endless.\n3. The nose is the owner in the body, the smellable is the elemental. The earth is the deity, the artery is\nthe link. He that is in the nose etc., -- meditate on him.\n4. The tongue is the owner of the body, the savourable is the elemental. Varuna is the deity; the artery is\nthe link. He that is in the tongue etc., -- meditate on him.\n5. The skin is the owner of the body, the touchable is the elemental, Vayu is the deity, the artery is the\nlink. He that is in the skin etc., -- meditate on him.\n6. The mind is the owner, the thinkable things are the elemental, the moon is the deity, the artery is the\n\nlink. He that is in the mind etc., -- meditate on him.\n7. Intellect is the owner, the cognizable is the elemental. Brahma the deity etc. He that is in the intellect\netc., -- meditate on him.\n8. Ego is the owner \u2013 object of the \u2018I\u2019 concept is the elemental, Rudra the deity \u2013 He that is the ego \u2013\nmeditate on him.\n9. Speech the owner, utterable the elemental, fire the deity \u2013 He that is \u2013 meditate on him.\n10. The mind stuff is the owner, the apprehensible is the elemental, the Jiva is the deity \u2013 meditate on\nhim.\n11. The hands are the owners, what is grasped is the elemental, Indra the deity \u2013 He that is in the hands\netc., -- meditate on him.\n12. The feet are the owners, the destination is the elemental, Vishnu the deity \u2013 He that is in the feet\netc., -- meditate on him.\n13. The male organ is the owner, the delectable is the elemental, Prajapati is the deity \u2013 He that is in the\nmale organ etc., -- meditate on him.\n14. He is the omniscient, almighty, inner ruler, source of all, waited on by all bliss but does not wait on\nbliss; waited on by Vedas and Shastras, but not waiting on them; whose food all this is but who is never\nfood; agent and governor of all leadings, made of food-soul of elements, made of Prana \u2013 soul of senseorgans, made of mind; soul of thought, made of knowledge \u2013 soul of time, made of bliss \u2013 soul of\ndissolution.\n15. There is oneness \u2013 how can there be duality \u2013 No mortality \u2013 how immortality ? Not cognisant\ninwardly or outwardly, or both ways \u2013 not a mass of knowledge, neither knowing nor not knowing.\nThus the Fifth Section\nLESSON THREE\n1. In The beginning there was nothing here \u2013 These creatures are born sans root and support.\n2-3. Narayana is the eye as well as the visible, ear as well as the audible, nose and the scentable, tongue\nand the tastable, skin and the tactile, mind and the thinkable, intellect and its contents, ego and its field,\nspeech and its contents, hands, feet, their fields, anus and genital \u2013 all are Narayana. Supporter,\nordainer, transformer \u2013 all is He.\n4. Adityas, Rudras, Maruts, Vasus, Asvins, Rik, Yajus, Sama, Mantras, Agni, oblation \u2013 all are\nNarayana, so also mothers, fathers etc.\n5. Viraja, Sudarsana, Jita, Saumya, Amogha, Kumara, Amrita, Satya, Madhyama, Nasira, Sisura, Asura,\nSurya, Bhasvati are the names.\n6. Roars, sings, blows, rains \u2013 Varuna, Aryama, Chandra, kala, kavi, Dhata, Brahma, Indra, Days and\nHalf-days, moments as well as ages \u2013 all are He.\n7. All this is Purusha only \u2013 the past and the future \u2013 that high place of Vishnu \u2013 the Suris (sages) look\nupon this always like the eye spread in the sky. The sages without mental conflict enhance its glory.\nThis is the doctrine of liberation according to the Vedas.\nThus the Sixth Section\nLESSON FOUR: THE NATURE OF THE INNER CONTROLLER\n1. The unborn, sole, immortal being inside the body, whose body is the Earth and who moves inside the\nbody unknown to the Earth, who moves inside water, as the body unknown to it, who moves inside fire\nunknown to it, who moves inside air unknown to it, so also inside Mind, Intellect, Ego, Chitta (mindstuff), Avyakta (unmanifest), Akshara (imperishable), Death \u2013 He is the inner, sinless, self, divine\nNarayana.\n2. This he (Adibrahma) imported to Apantaratamas (Vishnu), Vishnu to Brahma, he to Ghorangiras\nwho gave it to Raikva who gave it to Rama. He gave it to all living beings. Such is the doctrine of\nNirvana according to Vedas.\n\nThus the Seventh Section\nLESSON FIVE: THE SELF IN THE BODY\nIn this body of fat, flesh, moisture is placed this pure self of all, within the cave. The wise behold the\nimmortal, luminous bliss, bodiless and imponderable, enshrined in this cave, the master of all, formless,\nmassed splendour, pure, detached, divinely shining, the self that exceeds and whose form is\nimponderable. They behold it by sublation in this body that is as fickle as bubbles in water, empty like\nthe plantain pith, a city in the sky, a painted wall, very much conditioned.\nThus the Eighth Section\n1-14. Then Raikva asked, \u2018Sir, into what do all things set ?\u2019 He answered \u2018The visible disappears in the\neye, it is resolved (in the self) in the eye. The visible disappears in the sun, it is resolved in the sun.\nWhat disappears in the Virat (cosmic Man) is resolved in the self in the Virat. What disappears in the\nPrana is resolved in the Prana. What disappears in Vijnana (cognition) is resolved (in the self) in the\nVijnana. What disappears in Ananda is resolved in Ananda (Bliss). What disappears in the Turiya is\nresolved in Turiya. That self is immortal, fearless, painless, infinite seedless. (All things are) resolved\nin that self\u2019 \u2013 so said he.\n15. He who knows this seedless (Brahman) himself becomes seedless. He does not get birth and death,\nis not deluded, nor pierced or burned; does not tremble or get angry \u2013 they say he is the self \u2013 the\nburner of all.\n16. This self is not got by hundreds of expositions, not by great learning, nor by reliance on intellectual\nknowledge, nor through power of memory, Vedas, sacrifices, austerities, Sankhya or Yoga, Ashramas,\nelucidation, laudation and exercises. The Vedic scholars achieve it, having become calm, restrained,\nwithdrawn, tolerant and concentrating.\nThus the Nineth Section\nThen Raikva asked, \u2018Sir, in what are all these established, He replied \u2018In the Rasatalas\u2019. He asked \u2018In\nwhat are the Rasatalas woven, warp and woof ?\u2019 \u2018In the Bhu regions\u2019.\n\u2018In what are Bhu woven ?\u2019 \u2018In Suvar\u2019.\n\u2018In what are Suvar woven ?\u2019 \u2018In Mahar\u2019.\n\u2018In what are Mahar woven ?\u2019 \u2018In Janas\u2019.\n\u2018In what are Janas woven ?\u2019 \u2018In Tapas\u2019.\n\u2018In what are Tapas woven ?\u2019 \u2018In Prajapati\u2019s region\u2019.\n\u2018In what are these woven ?\u2019 \u2018In Brahma\u2019s region\u2019.\nAll the worlds are extended, warp and woof, in the Brahman, like gems in a string \u2013 Thus he spoke.\nWhoever knows these worlds as extended in the self, indeed, becomes the self. This is the doctrine of\nNirvana of the Vedas.\nThus the Tenth Section\nLESSON SIX: THE UPWARD PATH\nThen Raikva asked him, \u2018Sir, this mass of knowledge moving upwards, what place does he leave when\ndeparting upwards ?\u2019 He replied \u2018In the centre of the heart is a red mass of flesh \u2013 in it a small white\nlotus, blooming like a lily in many ways. In its centre is a sea with a shining space in the middle. Four\narteries are these \u2013 Rama, Arama, Iccha, Apunarbhava (pleasing, not pleasing, desire and not born\nagain). Of these Rama leads to the world of merit through merit, Arama to the world of demerit through\ndemerit. By Iccha, one reaches what one thinks of. By Apunarbhava he breaks through the sheath\n(Kosa) then the cranium, earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, elements, Mahat, Avyakta, akshara, Mrityu.\nThis Mrityu becomes one with the supreme deity. Beyond that there is neither being nor non-being, nor\ntheir combination. This is the doctrine of Nirvana of the Vedas.\n\nThus the Eleventh Section\nLESSON SEVEN: SAMADHI\nFrom Narayana, arose raw food (Ignorance of Atman) (at the beginning of Brahma\u2019s day); at the end of\nthe day (the deluges) is cooked in Aditya. Flesh etc., are again cooked in the gastric fire. Eat only what\nis fresh, not meant for another \u2013 do not beg for it.\nThus the Twelfth Section\n1. The sage should desire to be with child-like nature, which is unattached, faultless. Through silence,\nlearning, free from obligation is got aloneness. Prajapati said, \u2018Knowing the great place, one should\nlive at the base of a tree, ill-clad, friendless, alone in Samadhi desiring the self alone, having won all\ndesired objects, desireless, desires eroded. He is not afraid of elephants, lions, flies, mongoose, snakes\netc., knowing as forms of death. One should remain like a tree; he shall not become angry even when\ncut down, or tremble, like stone, like sky, he shall remain with truth.\n2. The heart of all smells is Earth, of tastes water, of forms fire, of touchless air, of sounds ether.\nAvyakta is the heart of all movements, Mrityu of all Sattvas (living beings). Death indeed becomes one\nwith the supreme Deity. Beyond it there is neither being nor non-being nor their combination \u2013 this is\nthe doctrine of Nirvana of the Vedas.\nThus the Thirteenth Section\nLESSON EIGHT\nThe earth is indeed the food, water is the eater; water is the food, fire the eater; fire is the food, air is\nthe eater; air is the food, ether the eater; mind the food, intellect the eater; intellect the food, Avyakta\nthe eater; Avyakta the food, Akshara (imperishable) is the eater, Akshara the food, Death is the eater \u2013 it\nbecomes one in the supreme deity beyond which there is neither existence nor non-existence \u2013 this is\nthe Vedic doctrines of liberation.\nThus the Fourteenth Section\nLESSON NINE: BURNING THE PRINCIPLES (BASES)\nThe Raikva asked, \u2018Sir, this mass of knowledge, the spirit \u2013 when he departs, which does he burn ?\u2019\nThe reply, \u2018He burns Prana, Apana, Vyana, Udana, Samana, Vairambha, Mukhya, Antaryama,\nPrabhanja, Kumara, Syena, Sveta, Krishna, Naga, also Prithvi etc., from Jagarita upto Turiya;\nLokaloka, dharma and adharma; regions without the sun, without limits and light \u2013 Mrityu becomes\none with the supreme deity \u2013 this is the Vedic lecture of liberation\u2019.\nThus the Fifteenth Section\nLESSON TEN: IMPARTING BRAHMAVIDYA\nThe secret doctrine of Subala, should not be taught to one who is not tranquil, one who is not son or\ndisciple, one who stays for less than a year, whose family and character are unknown.\nTo one supremely devoted to god and so to the preceptor, these ideas reveal themselves, to the great\nsoul !\nThis is the doctrine of liberation according to Vedas.\nThus the Sixteenth Section\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\n\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Subalopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Kshurika": "\nKshurika Upanishad\nTranslated by P. R. Ramachander\nPublished by celextel.org\nOm !

Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nKshurika means knife. This Upanishad shows us the way to cut the attachment with this world using\nthe knife called wisdom and shows us the way to salvation. It is called \u201cKshurikopanishad.\u201d\nI am relating to you the Kshurikopanishad. Using which we can attain awakening through Yoga and\nreach the birthless state. 1\n(Slokas 2-9 are not available.)\nUsing the mind with very sharp wisdom as knife, you have to meditate on the secret place called\n\u201cprabhada\u201d which is above the feet and cut it and go above. 10\nUsing the path of a sharp mind you have to practice yoga relentlessly and have to reach out the secret\nplace called \u201cIndra Vajram\u201d which is in a place above the knees and separate it out using meditation\nand Yoga. 11\nThen you have to release the life power which is in between the union of thighs. Practicing skilful yoga\nyou should separate it out and go upward. 12\nThen you have to attain the group of nadis (nerves) near the neck and realize the 101 Nadis there and\n\nidentify the best three Nadis. You have to identify the Ida Nadi which is the protector on the left side,\nthe pingala Nadi on the right side and understand the proper position of Sushumna Nadi. The one who\nidentifies this is the only one who understand the secrets of Vedas. 13-14\nSushumna Nadi is the one which makes you merge with the ultimate reality (Brahman) and is one\nwithout any deficiencies and is of the form of Brahmam. In each of the 72000 Nadis, there is a material\nwhich is like oil. This is taken out of it by meditation. Only in case of Sushumna Nadi, it is not possible\nto separate this oily material out of it. 15\nSimilar to the fact that oil gets the fragrance of jasmine flower when it joins with it, this Nadi gets the\nsmell of the good or bad deed done by a person. So you have to meditate on this Nadi. 16\nThen this person who has won over his mental senses should sit in a place without any sound and\nbecome detached, realize the philosophy of yoga, become one with no desires and should withdraw\nwithin himself like the lamps getting off one by one when they are lit together. 17-21\nThe one who realizes yoga through intense practice of pranayama and meditation on Om cuts off the\nbonds of family life using the very sharp mind which has been sharpened using an efficient sharpener\nof renunciation and gets freedom from all bondage. 22\nThe one who gets freedom from desires reaches the deathless state. The one who gets freedom from all\ndesires by cutting off all desires and affection becomes devoid of all bonds. 23\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm !

The eight-footed immaculate Swan, bound with three cords, subtle and imperishable, to whom three\nways lead, I see not though I see it everywhere.\n2. At the time all living beings are confounded (in the darkness of nescience) when (however) the\npileless darkness is shattered (by the sun of saving knowledge). The sages established in Sattva behold\nthe Absolute beyond Gunaa (right) in the sphere of gunas.\n3 (a). Contemplated by sages like Kumara, etc.; the Absolute is not otherwise capable of being\nperceived (at all).\n3(b)-4. The agent of superimposition the Unborn (Maya), the nescient eight-fold inveterate mother of\nmodifications; thus it is extended and again prodded. The world under such power and guidance gives\nrise to the values of man.\n5. The Lord\u2019s mighty Maya, having both a beginning and end, the creatrix, brings beings into existence;\nwhite, black and red (She) fulfils all desires.\n6. (The ignorant) experiences this non-objective Maya (whose real nature is) unknown (even) to sages\nlike Kumara. The Lord alone freely following (Her) enjoys Maya (as Her Lord and Companion).\n7. He enjoys (Her) through both contemplation and action. He, the omnipresent one, sustains (Her) who\nis common to one and all, the yielder (of desired objects) and is enjoyed by the sacrificers.\n8. The magnanimous (sages) behold in (the sphere of) Maya the bird eating the fruits (of Karmas). The\npriests who have completed their Vedic training have declared the Other to be detached.\n9. The masters of the Rig-Veda, well-versed in the Shastras repeat what the Yajur-Vedins have declared.\n\nThe adepts in Sama-Veda singing Brhatsama and Rathantara also (reaffirm this truth).\n10. (Vedic) sages like Bhrigu and the Bhargavas \u2013 these followers of the Atharva-Veda, practising the\nVeda, the mantras and the secret doctrines, in the sequence on Words, (all set forth the same doctrine).\n11-13. The faithful co-disciple, firm and accomplished, the red Bull, the sacrificial Remainder \u2013 as all\nthese, in regard to Its immensity; and as Time, Life, the divine wrath, the Destroyer, the great Lord, the\nBecoming, Rudra, the Protector of Jivas, the Rewarder of the virtuous, the Lord of living beings, the\nVirat, the sustainer and the Waters (of life), is the all-Pervader lauded by beings magnified in the\nmantras and well-known to the Atharva-Veda.\n14. Some aver Him (the great Lord) as the twenty sixth (Principle); others as the twenty seventh; the\nmasters of the Atharva-Veda and the Atharva Upanishads know the Spirits beyond qualities, as set forth\nin the Sankhya.\n15. The manifest and the unmanifest have been counted (together) as twenty four. (Some) declare Him\nnon-dual; as dual; as three-fold; and similarly as five-fold.\n16.

    "Sarvasara": "\nSarva Sara Upanishad\nTranslated by Swami Madhavananda\nPublished by Advaita Ashram, Kolkatta\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm !

What is Avidya\n(nescience) ? What is Vidya (knowledge) ? What are the states of Jagrat (waking), Svapna (dreaming) ,\nSushupti (Dreamless sleep), and the fourth, Turiya (Absolute) ? What are the Annamaya, Pranamaya,\nManomaya, Vijnanamaya and Anandamaya Koshas (vestures or sheaths of the soul) ? What is the Karta\n(agent), what the Jiva (individual self), the Kshetrajna (knower of the body), the Sakshi (Witness), the\nKutastha, the Antaryamin (Internal Ruler) ? What is the Pratyagatman (Inner Self), what the\nParamatman (Supreme Self), the Atman, and also Maya ? -- the master of Self looks upon the body and\nsuch like things other than the Self as Itself: this egoism is the bondage of the soul. The cessation of\nthat (egoism) is Moksha, liberation. That which causes that egoism is Avidya, nescience. That by which\nthis egoism is completely turned back is Vidya, knowledge. When the self, by means of its four and ten\norgans of sense beginning with the mind and benignly influenced by the sun and the rest which appear\noutside, perceives gross objects such as sound etc., then it is the Atman\u2019s Jagrat (wakeful) state. When,\neven in the absence of sound etc., (the self) not divested of desire for them, experiences, by means of\nthe four organs, sound and the rest in the form of desires \u2013 then it is the Atman\u2019s state of Svapna\n(dream). When the four and ten organs cease from activity, and there is the absence of differentiated\nknowledge, then is the Atman\u2019s state of Sushupti (dreamless sleep).\n2. When the essence of consciousness which manifests itself as the three states, is a witness of the\nstates, (but is) itself devoid of states, positive or negative, and remains in the state of non-separation\nand oneness, then it is spoken of as the Turiya, the fourth. The aggregate of the six sheaths, which are\n\nthe products of food, is called the Annamaya-kosha, alimentary sheath. When the fourteen kinds of\nVayus beginning with the Prana, are in the alimentary sheath, then it is spoken of as the Pranamayakosha, vesture of the vital airs. When the Atman united with these two sheaths performs, by means of\nthe four organs beginning with the mind, the functions of desire, etc., which have for their objects\nsound and the rest, then it (this state) is called the Manomaya-kosha, mental sheath. When the soul\nshines being united with these three sheaths, and cognisant of the differences and non-differences\nthereof then it is called the Vijnanamaya-kosha, sheath of intelligence. When these four sheaths remain\nin their own cause which is Knowledge (Brahman), in the same way as the latent Banyan tree remains\nin the Banyan seed, then it is spoken of as the Anandamaya-kosha, causal frame of the Soul. When it\ndwells in the body, as the seat of the idea of pleasure and pain, then it is the Karta, agent. The idea of\npleasure is that which pertains to wished-for objects, and the idea of pain is that which pertains to\nundesirable objects. Sound, touch, sight, taste, and smell are the causes of pleasure and pain. When the\nsoul, conforming itself to good and bad actions, has made a link of the present body (with its past\nbody), and is seen to be effecting a union, a connection as it were, with the body not yet received, then\nit is called the Jiva, individual soul, on account of its being limited by Upadhis. The five groups are\nthose beginning with the mind, those beginning with the Prana, those beginning with the Sattva, those\nbeginning with the will, and those beginning with merit. The ego possessing the attributes of these five\ngroups, does not die out without the knowledge of the ever-attained Self. That which, owing to its\nproximity to the Self, appears as imperishable and is attributed to Atman, is called the Linga-sharira\n(subtle body), and the \u201cheart\u2019s knot\u201d. The Consciousness which manifests itself therein is called the\nKshetrajna, Knower of the Kshetra (body).\n3. He who is the cogniser of the manifestation and disappearance of the knower, knowledge, and the\nknowable, but is himself devoid of such manifestation and disappearance, and is self-luminous, is\ncalled the Sakshi, Witness. When being perceived in an undifferentiated manner in the intelligence of\nall beings, from Brahma (the Creator) down to an ant, it resides in the intelligence of all beings, then it\nis called the Kutastha. When, standing as the means of realising the real nature of the Kutastha and\nothers, which are differentiations by virtue of possessing limiting adjuncts, the Atman manifests itself\nas inter-woven in all bodies, like the thread through a string of jewels, then it is called the Antaryamin,\nInternal Ruler. When the Atman shines forth - absolutely free from all limiting adjuncts, brilliant, as a\nhomogeneous mass of consciousness in its nature of pure Intelligence, independent \u2013 then, it is spoken\nof as the Entity of \u201cThou\u201d (Tvam), and as the Pratyagatman, Inner-Self. (That which is) Satya (the\nReality), Jnana (Knowledge), Ananta (the Infinite), Ananda (Bliss), is Brahman. The Reality is the\nindestructible; That which, when name, space, time, substance, and causation are destroyed, dies not, is\nthe indestructible; and that is called Satya, the Reality. And Jnana \u2013 that essence of Intelligence which\nhas no beginning and no end, spoken of as Jnana.\n4. And Ananta, the Infinite, (remaining in the same manner) as (does) clay in modifications of clay, as\ngold in modifications of gold, as thread in fabrics of thread, the antecedent, all-pervading\nConsciousness, that is in all phenomena of creation beginning with the Unmanifested, is called the\nInfinite. And Ananda, Bliss \u2013 the essence of the consciousness of happiness, the ocean of measureless\nbliss, and the state of undifferentiated happiness is called Bliss. That, of which the above fourfold\nnature is an indication, and which is permanent in all space, time, substance, and causation, is called the\nEntity of \u201cThat\u201d (Tat) Paramatman, Supreme Self, and Para-Brahman, or the Highest Brahman.\nDistinguished from the Entity of \u201cThou\u201d (when it appears to be) possessed of attributes, as well as from\nthe Entity of \u201cThat\u201d (when it appears to be) possessed of attributes, that which is all-pervading like the\nsky, subtle, whole by itself, pure Existence, the Entity of \u201cArt\u201d (Asi). Self-luminous, is spoken of as the\nAtman; the Entity of \u201cnot-That\u201d, also is spoken of as Atman. That which is beginningless, fruitful, open\nto both proof and disproof, neither real nor unreal, nor real-unreal \u2013 non-existent, when, because of the\nimmutability of its own substratum, the cause of change is ascertained; -- existent when it is not so\nascertained \u2013 (thus that) which is undefinable, is called Maya.\n\n5. I am neither the body nor the ten senses, Buddhi, Mind, Ego. Without Prana and mind, pure, I am\nalways the witness, pure consciousness, surely. I am neither the doer nor the enjoyer, only a witness to\nPrakriti. By my presence body etc., function as alive, still, eternal, ever joy, pure. I am Brahman to be\nknown from all Vedanta, yet unknowable like sky and air. I am neither form nor action, only Brahman.\n6. I am not body; birth, death do not come to me. I am not Prana \u2013 have no hunger and thirst; I am not\nmind \u2013 have no grief or delusion. I am not the doer \u2013 have no bondage or release.\nOm !

(1) What is Brahman?\n(2) Who is God?\n(3) Who is living being?\n(4) What is Prakriti?\n(5) Who is the Supreme Self?\n(6) Who is Brahma ?\n(7) Who is Vishnu ?\n(8) Who is Rudra ?\n(9) Who is Indra ?\n(10) Who is (the god of) Death ?\n(11) Who is the Sun ?\n(12) Who is the Moon ?\n(13) Who are the Gods ?\n(14) Who are the demons ?\n(15) Who are the evil spirits ?\n(16) Who are men ?\n(17) Who are women ?\n\n(18) Who are animals and so forth ?\n(19) What is the immobile ?\n(20) Who are the Brahmanas, etc., ?\n(21) What is a caste ?\n(22) What is deed ?\n(23) What is a non-deed ?\n(24) What is knowledge ?\n(25) What is ignorance ?\n(26) What is pleasure ?\n(27) What is pain ?\n(28) What is heaven ?\n(29) What is hell ?\n(30) What is bondage ?\n(31) What is liberation ?\n(32) What is to be adored ?\n(33) Who is the disciple ?\n(34) Who is the sage ?\n(35) Who is the deluded ?\n(36) What is the demoniac ?\n(37) What is austerity ?\n(38) Which is the supreme abode ?\n(39) What is to be sought after ?\n(40) What is to be rejected ?\n(41) Who is the renouncer (Sannyasin) ?\n3. (1) Brahman is the ineffable Spirit. It appears as the Mahat (the Sankhyan Great), the ego, (the\nelements) earth, water, fire, air and ether \u2013 the macrocosm and as actions, knowledge and ends. It is\nnon-dual and free from all adjuncts. It is big with all powers and is without beginning and end. It may\nbe spoken of as pure, good, quiescent, unqualified.\n4. (2) God is the veritable Brahman that, depending on Its power called Prakriti creates the worlds and\nenters (into them) as the inner Controller of Brahma, etc., (He) is Ishvara, as He controls the intellect\nand the sense-organs.\n5. (3) The living being (Jiva) is he who, through false superimposition, affirms \u2018I am gross\u2019 due to \u2018the\nname and form\u2019 of Brahma, Vishnu, Isana, Indra, etc. (Jiva thinks): Though I am one, due to the\ndifferences of the causes that originate the body, the Jivas are many.\n6. (4) Prakriti is but the power of Brahman; it is intellectual in nature and competent to create the\nvariegated and marvellous world from (the matrix) of Brahman.\n7. (5) The supreme Self is Brahman alone being altogether different from body, etc.\n8-9. (6-20) Brahma, Vishnu, Indra, (the god of) Death, the Sun, the Moon, the gods, the demons, men,\nwomen, animals, etc.; the immobile the Brahmanas, etc.; are that very Spirit.\n10. (21) Neither skin nor blood nor flesh nor bone has caste; To self is caste ascribed through mere\nusage.\n11. (22) \u2018I do the deeds that are done through sense-organs\u2019 \u2013 the deed thus done as centred in the Self\nalone is the deed (in question).\n12. (23) The deed done with conceit as agent and enjoyer, causing birth, etc., binds; The non-deed is the\nobligatory and occasional action \u2013 sacrifice, holy vow, austerity, gifts, etc., done without desire for their\nfruit.\n13. (24) Knowledge is the immediate realization, due to the disciplining of body and sense-organs,\nservice rendered to the Teacher, hearing, thinking and meditation, that there is nothing but Spirit, the\nessence of both subjects and objects, which is immutable among the mutables like pots and clothes, the\n\nsame in all, their innermost (essence).\n14. (25) Ignorance is the illusory knowledge \u2013 like that of the snake in the rope \u2013 of Brahman that is All\nin all, all-pervasive and non-dual. (This illusory knowledge) is associated with a plurality of selves\nbased on the plurality of the adjuncts of bondage and liberation, viz.; stations in life, castes, men,\nwomen, the immobiles, mankind, (lower) animals and gods.\n15. (26) Pleasure is the blissful state that succeeds the knowledge of the essence of Being, Intelligence\nand Bliss. (27) It (Dukha - pain) is the mere Sankalpa (or the thinking) of the objects of mundane\nexistence (or of not-Self).\n16. (28) Heaven is the association with the holy.\n17. (29) Association with the worldly folk who are unholy alone is hell.\n18. (30) Bondage consists in imagining due to the beginningless latent impressions of nescience, \u2018I am\nborn, etc.\u2019\n19. Bondage consists in imagining a plunge into the flux of existence with its possessive claims on\nfields, gardens, houses, children, wives, brothers, mothers and fathers.\n20. Bondage is the conceit of egoistic agency in regard to actions, etc.\n21. Bondage is the imagination prompted by the desire for the eight powers, anima, etc.\n22. Bondage is the imagination prompted by the yearning for adoring gods, men, etc.\n23. Bondage is the imagination (leading to) the practice of Yoga with its eight limbs, Yama, etc.\n24. Bondage is the planning of action and duties bound up with castes and stations of life.\n25. Bondage is to imagine that Atman has qualities like doubts, fear, etc.\n26. Bondage is to plan (to acquire) knowledge, to perform sacrifices, vows, austerity and (make) gifts.\n27. Bondage is to plan to devote oneself exclusively to moksha.\n28. Bondage is what springs exclusively from imagination.\n29. (31) Liberation is the attenuation, through discrimination between the eternal and the ephemeral, of\nthe sense of ownership in regard to objects that generate fleeting pleasures and pains in the\ntransmigratory life.\n30. (32) Adorable is the teacher who leads one to Brahman, the Spirit dwelling in all bodies.\n31. (33) The disciple is Brahman indeed that remains altogether immersed in the knowledge of the\nworld as obliterated by the awareness (of its ground, viz., Brahman).\n32. (34) The sage is the knower of the essence of Self-awareness present in all as their innermost (part).\n33. (35) The deluded is he who is sustained by the conceit of egoism as regards agency, etc.\n34. (36) Demoniac is the austerity, rooted in entrenched attachment, aversion, destructive violence,\nhypocrisy, etc.; that torments oneself by performing \u2018repetition of holy names\u2019 and Agnihotra while\nfasting and that is prompted by the desire to secure the power of gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and\nIsana.\n35. (37) Austerity is the burning, in the fire of immediate realization of the world\u2019s falsity, of the seed\nof imagination fashioned by the desire to secure the power of Brahma, etc.\n36. (38) The supreme abode is Brahman\u2019s status, one of eternal freedom, comprising Being,\nIntelligence, and Bliss, beyond the qualities of the inner organ and the sense-organs and the vital\nbreaths.\n37. (39) To be sought after is the essence of the pure Spirit undetermined by space, time and objects.\n38. (40) To be rejected is the thought that true is the world other than one\u2019s own Self that is perceived\nby the false sense organs and the intellect.\n39. (41) The Sannyasin (mendicant monk) is the wandering independent ascetic who has known for\ncertain, in the indeterminate concentration (Nirvikalpa-Samadhi), \u2018I am Brahman\u2019. He is led upto it\nthrough the experiential knowledge of the contents of Major texts like: \u2018There is no plurality here\u2019; \u2018All\nthis is Brahman\u2019; 'That Thou Art', etc.; after renouncing all duties, sense of possession and the ego, and\ntaking refuge in the beloved Brahman. That ascetic is liberated; he is adorable; he is the Yogin; he is the\nImmense; he is the Brahmana.\n\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Niralambopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Sukarahasya": "\nSuka Rahasya Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1-19. Now we expound the Rahasya Upanishad: the divine sages, worshipping Brahma, asked: Lord,\ntell us the Rahasya Upanishad. He said, \u2018In the past Vyasa, the treasure of all Vedas and penance asked\nShiva: O Lord of great wisdom, who has vowed firmly to break the bondage (of life). The time has\ncome to give initiation to my son Suka into the sacrament of Veda\u2019. Shiva said, \u2018When the sole\nBrahman is imparted by me, your son will depart by himself having got detachment\u2019.\nVyasa said: Be it as it may; in the Upanayana, when Brahman is imparted, may my son become\nomniscient very quickly and get the four kinds of Moksha.\nThen Shiva, hearing this sat in a divine seat to give instruction. Suka, the fortunate, came there with\ndevotion and getting the Pranava, spoke again to Shiva.\nSuka aid, \u2018First among gods, all-knowing, be pleased. The supreme Brahman, inherent in Om, has been\nimparted; the special sense 'That Thou Art' etc., with the six limbs, I desire to hear\u2019.\nShiva said, \u2018Well said, O treasure of knowledge, you have asked for the desirable, the mystery of the\nVedic texts, named Rahasyopanishad with the six parts, knowing which one shall be directly released.\nThe texts without the six parts one should not teach. Just as Upanishads are the crown of the Vedas, so\nis the Rahasya of Upanishads. For the wise man who meditates upon Brahman, holy spots, Vedic rites\nand mantras are useless. One wins a hundred years of life, meditating the sense of major texts. The\nsame is won, uttering this once.\n20. Om, for this mantra, Hamsa is the Rishi, unmanifest Gayatri is the metre, deity is Paramahamsa,\nHamsa is the seed, Sama-Veda is the power. \u2018I am That\u2019 is the pin. Its application is in the context of\n\nuttering the major text to secure the grace of the Paramahamsa. \u2018Truth, knowledge, infinity is Brahman.\nBow to the thumbs, \u2018Eternal joy is Brahman\u2019 \u2013 Svaha to the index fingers. \u2018Brahman is eternal joy,\nmostly\u2019 \u2013 Vasat to the middle fingers. \u2018That which is plenitude\u2019 \u2013 Hum to the ring fingers. \u2018The lord of\nplenitude\u2019 \u2013 Vasat to the little fingers. \u2018One and non-dual is Brahman. Phat\u2019 to the inside and outside of\nthe palms. \u2018Truth, knowledge, infinity is Brahman\u2019 \u2013 Phat to the inside and outside of the palm. \u2018Truth,\nknowledge, infinity is Brahman \u2013 bow to the heart\u2019.\n\u2018Eternal bliss is Brahman\u2019 \u2013 Svaha to the head \u2013 Vasat to the braid of hair. \u2018That which is plenitude\u2019 \u2013\nHum to armour \u2013 Vausat to the three eyes. \u2018One and non-dual Brahman\u2019 \u2013 Phat to the missile. The\nearth, old region, heaven, Om, this is the link of space.\n21-22. Meditation: I bow to the noble teacher, beyond becoming and the three Gunas, one, eternal,\nholy, witness of all knowledge, giver of bliss, beyond the world, sky-like, purpose of major texts.\nThe four major passages:\n(1) Consciousness is Brahman\n(2) I am Brahman\n(3) That Thou Art and\n(4) This self is Brahman.\nThose who recite the statement of identity become liberated in Sayujya (identity).\n23-24. Of the great incantation \u2018Tat\u2019, the seer is Hamsa, un-manifest Gayatri is the metre. Paramahamsa\nthe deity; Hamsa the seed; Sama-Veda, power; So\u2019ham is the pin; application is the meditation for my\nliberation. Bow to the thumbs, to that aspirant Svaha to Isana, the index fingers, Vasat to Aghora the\nmiddle fingers, to Sadyojata, the ring fingers, hum; to Vamadeva, the little fingers Vausat; to that spirit,\nIsana, Aghora etc. Phat.\nMeditation: Meditate on that shining light as knowledge and its objects and what is beyond them both,\ntaintless, awake, free and imperishable.\n25-26. Of the chant of \u2018Tvam\u2019 Vishnu is the seer, Gayatri is the metre, supreme self the deity, \u2018aim\u2019 the\nseed, \u2018klim\u2019 the power, \u2018sauh\u2019 the pin, application is to the repetition for my liberation.\nBow to Vasudeva, to the thumbs: Svaha to Samkarsana, the index-fingers; Vasat to Pradyumna, the\nmiddle fingers; Hum to Aniruddha, the ring fingers; Vausat to Vasudeva, the little finger; Phat to\nVasudeva and others.\nMeditation: I adore the word \u2018Thou\u2019 the Jiva state, in all living things, everywhere, impartite form,\ncontroller of mind and egoism.\n27. For \u2018Asi\u2019, the seer is Manah, metre Gayatri, deity Ardhanarishvara, seed is Avyaktadi, power is\nNrisimha, pin is supreme Self. Application is repetition for identification of Jiva and Brahman. I bow to\nthe thumbs, the dyad of Earth; Svaha to the index finger, the dyad of water. Vasat to the middle fingers,\nthe dyad of fire; Hum to the ring fingers, the dyad of Air; Vausat for the little fingers, the dyad of Ether;\nPhat for the front and back of the hand, the dyad of Earth etc. So too the consecration of the heart.\nBhuh, Bhuvah, Svah, Om. Thus the directions are enclosed.\n28-29. Meditation: \u2018Meditate ever on Asi, thou art. Aiming at the merger of Jiva in that, as long as the\nmind dwells on the purport\u2019. Thus have been stated the six limbs of the major texts.\n30-38. Now according to the classification of the mystic teachings are set forth the verses on the\npurport.\nPrajnana is that whereby one sees, hears, smells and makes clear all objects here, pleasant and\nunpleasant, by which one knows. In the four-faced Brahman, Indra and Devas, men, horses, cows, etc.,\nspirit is one Brahman \u2013 so, in me too Prajnana is Brahman. In this body being remains witness to the\nintellect and is called I. The Being full in itself is described as Brahman, referred to with Asmi. So, I\nam Brahman. The being, one without a second, without name and form before creation and even now is\ncalled That. The being called Thou here beyond the senses understood as one. Let this unity be\nexperienced. The inner self, from ego to the body, is called this (ayam) because it is self-luminous and\nrealizes intimately. The truth of the universe is stated of all that is seen by the word Brahman.\n\n39. I was in the state of dream of \u2018I\u2019 and \u201cMine\u2019 because of the absence of the vision of the spirit. But I\nwas awakened when the sun of my own nature arose by means of the major texts spoken clearly by the\nperception.\n40-42. Senses has two ways: expressed and implied. In \u2018Tattvam Asi\u2019 the expressed meaning is the\nsenses etc., which are elemental and the implied is, \u2018He\u2019 in \u2018you\u2019 (Tvam), in the word Tat the expressed\nsense is lordship etc., the implied is the supreme being which is Sat, Chit and Ananda. \u2018Asi\u2019 identifies\nthese two. Tvam and Tad mean effect and cause respectively when this is the adjunct; otherwise both\nare the same Sat, Chit and Ananda \u2013 separating the space and time faites the identity is got, just as in\nthe world, in the expression, \u2018This is that Devadatta\u2019.\nThe Jiva is having the effect-adjunct, Isa has cause-adjunct \u2013 when both are removed, only the full\nknowledge remains.\n43-45. First hearing from the Guru, then thought about it and meditation \u2013 this is the cause of full\nknowledge. Other knowledge will surely perish, while the knowledge of Brahman leads to Brahman.\nThe Guru should instruct the words of the Upanishad with the limbs, not merely the words \u2013 These are\nBrahma\u2019s words.\n46-53. Ishvara said, \u2018O Suka, thus being instructed by me as requested by Vyasa, you will become\nJivanmukta\u2019.\nThe Svara which is uttered at the start of Veda is Parameshvara. Suka being thus instructed by Shiva\nbecame one with the universe; rose, bowed to Shiva and giving up all possessions, went away as if\nswimming in the ocean of the supreme spirit.\nVyasa, seeing him go away as a recluse, went after him calling, affected by separation. All the world\nechoed him. Hearing this Vyasa was over joyed along with his son.\nHe who learns this through the Guru\u2019s grace will become released from all sin and enjoy Moksha.\nThus the Upanishad.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Sukarahasyopanishad belonging to the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",

It\nmust be asked, \u2018Who is a Brahmana\u2019 \u2013 the self, body, class, knowledge, action or virtue ?\nThe soul is not a Brahmana because the soul is the same in all bodies past and future. The same person\ntakes many bodies according to karma, nor is the body Brahmana \u2013 the body is the same from the\nChandala (to the highest caste) being made of the five elements and is seen to have old age, death etc.,\nalike. There is no fixity (of colour) such as Brahmana is white, Kshatriya is red, Vaishya is yellow and\nSudra is black; also when the father\u2019s body is cremated, the son etc., may be guilty of killing a\nBrahmana.\nNor is the class a Brahmana. Then there would be many classes within the classes. Many are the great\nsages: Rishyasringa born of a deer, Kausika of reed, Jambuka of a jackal, Valmiki of an ant-hill, Vyasa\nof a fisher-girl, Gautama of a hare\u2019s back, Vasistha of Urvasi, Agastya of a pot according to tradition.\nThese are not Brahmanas by birth but by their knowledge.\nNor is knowledge Brahmana: Kshatriyas and others also have knowledge. Nor is karma: all creatures\n\nare seen to have similar karma of Prarabdha etc., and all creatures act being impelled by karma. Nor is\na man of virtue: There are many givers of gold \u2013 Kshatriyas etc.\nOne who has directly realized, like the berry in the palm, the Atman without a second, devoid of class,\nquality and action and of defects like the six waves (like hunger), the states (like birth and death), of the\nnature of truth, knowledge and bliss, free from adjuncts, the basis of all thoughts, immanent in all\ncreatures, present inside and outside like space. Bliss impartite, beyond (ordinary) knowledge, to be\nrealized by experience alone \u2013 and having become successful, free from lust etc., rich in mental control,\nwithout greed etc., mind untouched by hypocrisy etc.\nThis is the intention of Veda etc. Otherwise the nature of Brahmana cannot be achieved.\nOne should contemplate one\u2019s self as the spirit without a second, truth, knowledge and bliss.\nThis is the Upanishad.\nOm!

PARAM-DHYANA (the supreme meditation) should be upon Tejo-bindu (the seed or source of\nspiritual light), which is the Atma of the universe, which is seated in the heart, which is of the size of an\natom, which pertains to Shiva, which is quiescent and which is gross and subtle, as also above these\nqualities.\n2. That alone should be the Dhyana of the Munis as well as of men, which is full of pains, which is\ndifficult to meditate on, which is difficult to perceive, which is the emancipated one, which is decayless\nand which is difficult to attain.\n3. One whose food is moderate, whose anger has been controlled, who has given up all love for society,\nwho has subdued his passions, who has overcome all pairs (heat and cold etc.), who has given up his\negoism, who does not bless anyone nor take anything from others;\n4. And also who goes where they naturally ought not to go and naturally would not go where they like\nto go \u2013 such persons also obtain three in the face. Hamsa is said to have three seats.\n5. Therefore know it is the greatest of mysteries, without sleep and without support. It is very subtle, of\nthe form of Soma and is the supreme seat of Vishnu.\n6. That seat has three faces, three gunas and three Dhatus and is formless, motionless, changeless,\nsizeless and supportless.\n7. That seat is without Upadhi and is above the reach of speech and mind. It is Svabhava (Self or\nnature) reachable only by Bhava (being).\n8. The indestructible seat is associateless, without bliss, beyond mind, difficult to perceive,\nemancipated and changeless. It should be meditated upon as the liberated, the eternal, the permanent\n\nand the indestructible.\n9. It is Brahman, is Adhyatma (or the deity presiding as Atma) and is the highest seat of Vishnu. It is\ninconceivable, of the nature of Chidatma and above the Akasa.\n10. It is void and non-void and beyond the void and is abiding in the heart. There is (in It) neither\nmeditation nor meditator, nor the meditated, nor the non-meditated.\n11. It is not the universe. It is the highest space; it is neither supreme nor above the supreme. It is\ninconceivable, unknowable, non-truth and not the highest.\n12. It is realised by the Munis, but the Devas do not know the supreme One. Avarice, delusion, fear,\npride, passion, anger, sin;\n13. Heat, cold, hunger, thirst, thought and fancy \u2013 (all these do not exist in It). (In It) there is no pride\nof (belonging to) the Brahmana caste, nor is there the collection of the knot of salvation.\n14. (In It) there is no fear, no happiness, no pains, neither fame nor disgrace. That which is without\nthese states is the supreme Brahman.\n15. Yama (forbearance), Niyama (religious observance), Tyaga (renunciation), Mouna (silence)\naccording to time and place, Asana (posture), Mulabandha, seeing all bodies as equal, the position of\nthe eye;\n16. Prana-samyamana (control of breath), Pratyahara (subjugation of the senses), Dharana, AtmaDhyana and Samadhi \u2013 these are spoken of as the parts (of Yoga) in order.\n17. That is called Yama in which one controls all his organs (of sense and actions) through the Vijnana\nthat all is Brahman; this should be practised often and often.\n18. Niyama, in which there is the supreme bliss enjoyed through the flowing (or inclination) of the\nmind towards things of the same (spiritual) kind, (viz., Brahman) and the abandoning of things\ndiffering from one another is practised by the sages as a rule.\n19. In Tyaga (renunciation), one abandons the manifestation (or objects) of the universe through the\ncognition of Atman that is Sat and Chit. This is practised by the great and is the giver of immediate\nsalvation.\n20. Mouna (the silence), in which, without reaching That, speech returns along with mind, is fit to be\nattained by the Yogins and should be ever worshipped by the ignorant (even).\n21. How is it possible to speak of \u2018That\u2019, from which speech returns ? How should it be described as\nthe universe as there is no word to describe it ?\n22. It is \u2018That\u2019 which is (really) called silence and which is naturally understood (as such). There is\nsilence in children, but with words (latent); whereas the knowers of Brahman have it (silence) but\nwithout words.\n23. That should be known as \u2018the lonely seat\u2019 in which there is no man in the beginning, middle, or end\nand through which all this (universe) is fully pervaded.\n24-25. The illusion of Brahma and all other beings takes place within one twinkling (of His eye). That\nshould be known as Asana (posture), in which one has with ease and without fatigue (uninterrupted)\nmeditation of Brahman; that is described by the word Kala (time), that is endless bliss and that is\nsecondless. Everything else is the destroyer of happiness.\n26. That is called Siddhasana (Siddha-posture) in which the Siddhas (psychical personages) have\nsucceeded in realising the endless One as the support of the universe containing all the elements, etc.\n27. That is called the Mulabandha, which is the Mula (root) of all worlds and through which the root\nChitta is (Bandha) bound. It should be always practised by the Rajayogins.\n28. One after having known the equality of the Angas (or parts of Yoga) point to one and the same\nBrahman, should be absorbed in that equal (or uniform) Brahman; if not, there is not that equality\n(attained). Then like a dry tree, there is straightness (or uniformity throughout).\n29. Making one\u2019s vision full of spiritual wisdom, one should look upon the world as full of Brahman.\nThat vision is very noble. It is (generally) aimed at the tip of the nose;\n30. But it should be directed towards that seat (of Brahman) wherein the cessation of seer, the seen and\n\nsight will take place and not towards the tip of the nose.\n31. That is called Pranayama (the control of breath), in which there is the control of the modifications\n(of mind) through the cognition of Brahman in all the states of Chitta and others.\n32. The checking of (the conception of the reality of) the universe, is said to be expiration. The\nconception of \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 is inspiration.\n33. The holding on (long) to this conception without agitation is cessation of breath. Such is the\npractice of the enlightened.\n34. The ignorant close their nose. That should be known as Pratyahara, through which one sees Atman\n(even) in the objects of sense and pleases Chitta through Manas. It should be practised often and often.\n35. Through seeing Brahman wherever the mind goes, the Dharana is meant that state where one\nindulges in the good thought:\n36. \u2018I am Brahman alone\u2019, and is without any support. This Dhyana is the giver of supreme bliss.\n37. Being first in a state of changelessness and then thoroughly forgetting (even) that state owing to the\ncognition of the (true) nature of Brahman \u2013 this is called Samadhi.\n38. This kind of bliss should be practised (or enjoyed) by a wise person till his cognition itself united in\na moment with the state of Pratyag (Atman).\n39. Then this King of Yogins becomes a Siddha and is without any aid (outside himself). Then he will\nattain a state, inexpressible and unthinkable.\n40. When Samadhi is practised, the following obstacles arise with great force \u2013 absence of right\ninquiry, laziness, inclination to enjoyment;\n41. Absorption (in material object), Tamas, distraction, impatience, sweat and absent-mindedness. All\nthese obstacles should be overcome by inquirers into Brahman.\n42. Through Bhava-Vrittis (worldly thoughts), one gets into them. Through Sunya-Vrittis (void or\nempty thoughts), one gets into them. But through the Vrittis of Brahman, one gets fullness.\n43. Therefore one should develop fullness through this means (of Brahman). He who abandons this\nVritti of Brahman, which is very purifying and supreme \u2013 that man lives in vain like a beast.\n44. But he who understands this Vritti (of Brahman) and having understood it makes advances in it,\nbecomes a good and blessed person, deserving to be worshipped by the three worlds.\n45. Those who are greatly developed through the ripening (of their past Karmas) attain the state of\nBrahman; others are simply reciters of words.\n46. Those who are clever in arguments about Brahman, but are without the action pertaining to\nBrahman and who are greatly attached to the world \u2013 those certainly are born again and again (in this\nworld) through their Ajnana;\n47. (The former) never remain, even for half a moment \u2013 without the Vritti of Brahman, like Brahma\nand others, Sanaka, etc., Suka and others.\n48. When a cause is subject to changes, it (as an effect) must also have its cause. When the cause ceases\nto exist in truth, the effect perishes through right discrimination. Then that substance (or principle)\nwhich is beyond the scope of words, remains pure.\n49. After that, Vritti Jnana arises in their purified mind; through meditation with transcendental energy,\nthere arises a firm certitude.\n50. After reducing the visible into the invisible state, one should see everything as Brahman. The wise\nshould ever stay in bliss with their understanding full of the essence of Chit.\nThus ends the first chapter.\nCHAPTER - II\nThen the Kumara asked Shiva: \u201cPlease explain to me the nature of Chinmatra, that is the partless nondual essence\u201d. The great Shiva replied:\n1-23. \u201cThe partless non-dual essence is the visible. It is the world, it is the existence, it is the Self, it is\nmantra, it is action, it is spiritual wisdom, it is water. It is the earth, it is Akasa, it is the books, it is the\n\nthree Vedas, it is the Brahman, it is the religious vow, it is Jiva, it is Aja (the unborn), it is Brahma, it is\nVishnu, it is Rudra; it is I, it is Atman, it is the Guru. It is the aim, it is sacrifice, it is the body, it is\nManas, it is Chitta, it is happiness, it is Vidya; it is the undifferentiated, it is the eternal, it is the\nsupreme, it is everything. O six-faced one, different from It there is nothing. None, none but It; It is I. It\nis gross, it is subtle, it is knowable, it is thou; it is the mysterious; it is the knower; it is existence, it is\nmother, it is father, it is brother, it is husband, It is Sutra (Atman), it is Virat. It is the body, it is the\nhead, it is the internal, it is the eternal, it is full, it is nectar, it is Gotra (clan), it is Griha (the house), it\nis the preservable, it is the moon, it is the stars, it is the sun, it is the holy seat. It is forgiveness, it is\npatience, it is the gunas, it is the witness. It is a friend, it is a relative, it is an ally, it is the king, town,\nkingdom and subjects. It is Om, Japa, meditation, the seat, the one worthy to be taken (in), the heart,\nthe Jyotis, Swarga (heaven) and Self\u201d.\n24. \u201cAll the partless and non-dual essence should be regarded as Chinmatra. Chinmatra alone is the\nAbsolute Consciousness; and this partless non-dual essence alone is the (real) essence.\n25. All having consciousness alone except those having changes, are Chinmatra. All this is Chinmatra.\n26. He is Chinmaya; the state of Atman is known as Chinmatra and the partless non-dual essence. The\nwhole world is Chinmatra. Your state and my state are Chinmatra.\n27. Akasa, earth, water, Vayu, Agni, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and all else that exist or do not, are\nChinmatra.\n28. That which is the partless non-dual essence is Chinmatra. All the past, present and future are\nChinmatra.\n29. Substance and time are Chinmatra. Knowledge and the knowable are Chinmatra. The knower is\nChinmatra. Everything is Chinmatra.\n30. Every speech is Chinmatra. Whatever else is Chinmatra. Asat and Sat are Chinmatra.\n31. The beginning and end are Chinmatra; that which is in the beginning and end is Chinmatra ever.\nThe Guru and the disciple are Chinmatra. If the seer and the seen are Chinmatra, then they are always\nChinmaya.\n32. All things wondrous are Chinmatra. The (gross) body is Chinmatra, as also subtle and causal\nbodies. There is nothing beyond Chinmatra.\n33. I and thou are Chinmatra. Form and non-form are Chinmatra. Virtue and vice are Chinmatra. The\nbody is a symbol of Chinmatra.\n34. Sankalpa, knowing, Mantra and others, the gods invoked in Mantras;\n35. The gods presiding over the eight quarters the phenomenal and the supreme Brahman are nothing\nbut Chinmatra. There is nothing without Chinmatra.\n36-38. Maya is nothing without Chinmatra. Puja (worship) is nothing without Chinmatra. Meditation,\ntruth, sheaths and others, the (eight) Vasus, silence, non-silence and indifference to objects \u2013 are\nnothing without Chinmatra. Everything is from Chinmatra. Whatever is seen and however seen \u2013 it is\nChinmatra so far.\n39-41. Whatever exists and however distant is Chinmatra. Whatever elements exist, whatever is\nperceived and whatever is Vedanta \u2013 all these are Chinmatra. Without Chinmatra, there is no motion, no\nMoksha and no goal aimed at. Everything is Chinmatra. Brahman that is the partless non-dual essence\nis known to be nothing but Chinmatra.\n42. Thou, O Lord, art the partless non-dual essence (stated) in the books, in me, in Thee and in the\nruler. He who thus perceives \u2018I\u2019 as of one homogeneity (pervading everywhere) will at once be\nemancipated through this spiritual wisdom. He is his own Guru with this profound spiritual wisdom.\nThus ends the second chapter.\nCHAPTER - III\nThe Kumara addressed his father (again): \u201cPlease explain to me the realisation of Atman\u201d. To which the\ngreat Shiva said:\n\n1-3. \u201cI am of the nature of the Parabrahman. I am the supreme bliss. I am solely of the nature of divine\nwisdom. I am the sole supreme, the sole quiescence, the sole Chinmaya, the sole unconditioned, the\nsole permanent and the sole Sattva. I am the \u2018I\u2019 that has given up \u2018I\u2019. I am one that is without anything.\nI am full of Chidakasha.\n4. I am the sole fourth one. I am the sole one above the fourth (state of Turya). I am of the nature of\n(pure) consciousness. I am ever of the nature of the bliss-consciousness.\n5-7. I am of the nature of the non-dual. I am ever of a pure nature, solely of the nature of divine\nwisdom, of the nature of happiness, without fancies, desires or diseases of the nature of bliss, without\nchanges or differentiations and of the nature of the eternal one essence and Chinmatra.\n8. My real nature is indescribable, of endless bliss, the bliss above Sat and Chit and the interior of the\ninterior. I am beyond reach of Manas and speech.\n9. I am of the nature of Atmic bliss, true bliss and one who plays with (my) Atman; I am Atman and\nSadashiva.\n10. My nature is Atmic spiritual effulgence. I am the essence of the Jyotis of Atman. I am without\nbeginning, middle, or end. I am like the sky.\n11. I am solely Sat, Ananda and Chit which is unconditioned and pure. I am the Sachchidananda that is\neternal, enlightened and pure.\n12. I am ever of the nature of the eternal Sesha (serpent-time). I am ever beyond all. My nature is\nbeyond form. My form is supreme Akasa.\n13. My nature is of the bliss of earth. I am ever without speech. My nature is the all-seat (foundation of\nall).\n14-15. I am ever replete with consciousness, without the attachment of body, without thought, without\nthe modifications of Chitta, the sole essence of Chidatma, beyond the visibility of all and of the form of\nvision. My nature is ever full.\n16. I am ever fully contented, the all, and Brahman, and the very consciousness; I am \u2018I\u2019. My nature is\nof the earth.\n17-21. I am the great Atman and the supreme of the supreme; I appear sometimes as different from\nmyself; sometimes as possessing a body, sometimes as a pupil and sometimes as the basis of the\nworlds. I am beyond the three periods of time, am worshipped by the Vedas, am determined by the\nsciences and am fixed in the Chitta. There is nothing left out by me, neither the earth nor any other\nobjects here. Know that there is nothing which is out of myself. I am Brahma, a Siddha, the eternally\npure, non-dual one. Brahman, without old age or death.\n22-25. I shine by myself; I am my own Atman, my own goal, enjoy myself, play in myself, have my\nown spiritual effulgence, am my own greatness and am used to play in my own Atman, look on my\nown Atman, and am in myself happily seated. I have my own Atman as the residue, stay in my own\nconsciousness, and play happily in the kingdom of my own Atman. Sitting on the real throne of my\nown Atman, I think of nothing else but my own Atman.\n26-32. I am Chidrupa alone, Brahman alone, Sachchidananda, the secondless, the one replete with bliss\nand the sole Brahman and ever without anything, have the bliss of my own Atman, the unconditioned\nbliss, and am always Atma-Akasa. I alone am in the heart like Chid-aditya (the consciousness-sun). I\nam content in my own Atman, have no form, or no decay, am without, the number one, have the nature\nof an unconditioned and emancipated one, and I am subtler than Akasa; I am without the existence of\nbeginning or end, of the nature of the all-illuminating, the bliss greater than the great, of the sole nature\nof Sat, of the nature of pure Moksha, of the nature of truth and bliss, full of spiritual wisdom and bliss,\nof the nature of wisdom alone and of the nature of Sachchidananda. All this is Brahman alone. There is\nnone other than Brahman and that is \u2018I\u2019. I am Brahman that is Sat and bliss and the ancient.\n33. The word \u2018thou\u2019 and the word \u2018that\u2019 are not different from me. I am of the nature of consciousness.\nI am alone the great Shiva.\n34. I am beyond the nature of existence. I am of the nature of happiness. As there is nothing that can\n\nwitness me, I am without the state of witness.\n35. Being purely of the nature of Brahman, I am the eternal Atman. I alone am the Adisesha (the\nprimeval Sesha). I alone am the Sesha.\n36. I am without name and form, of the nature of bliss, of the nature of being unperceivable by the\nsenses and of the nature of all beings;\n37-39. I have neither bondage nor salvation. I am of the form of eternal bliss. I am the primeval\nconsciousness alone, the partless and non-dual essence, beyond reach of speech and mind, of the nature\nof bliss everywhere, of the nature of fullness everywhere, of the nature of earthly bliss, of the nature of\ncontentment everywhere, the supreme nectary essence and the one and secondless Sat, (viz.,) Brahman.\nThere is no doubt of it.\n40-43. I am of the nature of all-void. I am the one that is given out by the Vedas. I am of the nature of\nthe emancipated and emancipation, of Nirvanic bliss, of truth and wisdom, of Sat alone and bliss, of the\none beyond the fourth, of one without fancy and ever of the nature of Aja (the unborn). I am without\npassion or faults. I am the pure, the enlightened, the eternal, the all-pervading and of the nature of the\nsignificance of Om, of the spotless and of Chit. I am neither existing nor non-existing.\n44-45. I am not of the nature of anything. I am of the nature of the actionless. I am without parts. I have\nno semblance, no manas, no sense, no Buddhi, no change, none of the three bodies, neither the waking,\ndreaming, or dreamless sleeping states.\n46. I am neither of the nature of the three pains nor of the three desires. I have neither Sravana nor\nManana in Chidatma in order to attain salvation.\n47. There is nothing like me or unlike me. There is nothing within me. I have none of the three bodies.\n48. The nature of Manas is unreal, the nature of Buddhi is unreal, the nature of Aham (the \u2018I\u2019) is unreal;\nbut I am the unconditioned, the permanent and the unborn.\n49. The three bodies are unreal, the three periods of time are unreal, the three Gunas are unreal, but I\nam of the nature of the Real and the pure.\n50. That which is heard is unreal, all the Vedas are unreal, the Shastras are unreal, but I am the Real and\nof the nature of Chit.\n51. The Murtis (Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra having limitation) are unreal, all the creation is unreal, all\nthe Tattvas are unreal, but know that I am the great Sadashiva.\n52. The master and the disciple are unreal, the mantra of the Guru is unreal, that which is seen is unreal,\nbut know me to be the Real.\n53. Whatever is thought of is unreal, whatever is lawful is unreal, whatever is beneficial is unreal, but\nknow me to be the Real.\n54. Know the Purusha (ego) to be unreal, know the enjoyments to be unreal, know things seen and\nheard are unreal as also the one woven warp-wise and woof-wise, viz., this universe;\n55-56. Cause and non-cause are unreal, things lost or obtained are unreal. Pains and happiness are\nunreal, all and non-all are unreal, gain and loss are unreal, victory and defeat are unreal.\n57-59. All the sound, all the touch, all the forms, all the taste, all the smell and all Ajnana are unreal.\nEverything is always unreal \u2013 the mundane existence is unreal \u2013 all the Gunas are unreal. I am of the\nnature of Sat. One should cognise his own Atman alone. One should always practise the mantra of his\nAtman.\n60-69. The mantra (Aham Brahmashmi) \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 removes all the sins of sight, destroys all other\nmantras, destroys all the sins of body and birth, the noose of Yama, the pains of duality, the thought of\ndifference, the pains of thought, the disease of Buddhi, the bondage of Chitta, all diseases, all grieves\nand passions instantaneously, the power of anger, the modifications of Chitta, Sankalpa, Crores of sins,\nall actions and the Ajnana of Atman.\n70-71. The mantra \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 gives indescribable bliss, gives the state of Ajada (the non inertness\nor the undecaying) and kills the demon of non-Atman. The thunderbolt \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 clears all the\nhill of not-Atman.\n\n72. The wheel \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 destroys the Asuras of not-Atman. The Mantra \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 will\nrelieve all (persons).\n73. The Mantra \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 gives spiritual wisdom and bliss. There are seven Crores of great\nMantras and there are Vratas (vows) of (or yielding) hundred Crores of births.\n74. Having given up all other Mantras, one should ever practise this Mantra. He obtains at once\nsalvation and there is not even a particle of doubt about it.\nThus ends the third chapter.\nCHAPTER - IV\nThe Kumara asked the great Lord: \u201cPlease explain to me the nature of Jivanmukti (embodied salvation)\nand Videhamukti (disembodied salvation).\u201d To which the great Shiva replied:\n1. \u201cI am Chidatma. I am Para-Atma. I am the Nirguna, greater than the great. One who will simply stay\nin Atman is called a Jivanmukta.\n2. He who realises: \u2018I am beyond the three bodies, I am the pure consciousness and I am Brahman\u2019, is\nsaid to be a Jivanmukta.\n3. He is said to be a Jivanmukta, who realises: \u2018I am of the nature of the blissful and of the supreme\nbliss, and I have neither body nor any other thing except the certitude \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 only.\n4-6. He is said to be a Jivanmukta who has not at all got the \u2018I\u2019 in myself, but who stays in Chinmatra\n(absolute consciousness) alone, whose interior is consciousness alone, who is only of the nature of\nChinmatra, whose Atman is of the nature of the all-full, who has Atman left over in all, who is devoted\nto bliss, who is undifferentiated, who is all-full of the nature of consciousness, whose Atman is of the\nnature of pure consciousness, who has given up all affinities (for objects), who has unconditioned bliss,\nwhose Atman is tranquil, who has got no other thought (than Itself) and who is devoid of the thought of\nthe existence of anything.\n7-11(a). He is said to be a Jivanmukta who realises: \u2018I have no Chitta, no Buddhi, no Ahamkara, no\nsense, no body at any time, no Pranas, no Maya, no passion and no anger, I am the great, I have nothing\nof these objects or of the world and I have no sin, no characteristics, no eye, no Manas, no ear, no nose,\nno tongue, no hand, no waking, no dreaming, or causal state in the least or the fourth state.\u2019\n11(b)-30(a). He is said to be a Jivanmukta, who realises: \u2018All this is not mind, I have no time, no space,\nno object, no thought, no Snana (bathing), no Sandhyas( junction-period ceremonies), no deity, no\nplace, no sacred places, no worship, no spiritual wisdom, no seat, no relative, no birth, no speech, no\nwealth, no virtue, no vice, no duty, no auspiciousness, no Jiva, not even the three worlds, no salvation,\nno duality, no Vedas, no mandatory rules, no proximity, no distance, no knowledge, no secrecy, no\nGuru, no disciple, no diminution, no excess, no Brahma, no Vishnu, no Rudra, no moon, no earth, no\nwater, no Vayu, no Akasa, no Agni, no clan, no Lakshya (object aimed at), no mundane existence, no\nmeditator, no object of meditation, no Mans, no cold, no heat, no thirst, no hunger, no friend, no foe, no\nillusion, no victory, no past, present, or future, no quarters, nothing to be said or heard in the least,\nnothing to be gone to (or attained), nothing to be contemplated, enjoyed or remembered, no enjoyment,\nno desire, no Yoga, no absorption, no garrulity, no quietude, no bondage, no love, no joy, no instant joy,\nno hugeness, no smallness, neither length nor shortness, neither increase nor decrease, neither\nAdhyaropa (illusory attribution) nor Apavada (withdrawal of that conception) , no oneness, no\nmanyness, no blindness, no dullness, no skill, no flesh, no blood, no lymph, no skin, no marrow, no\nbone, no skin, none of the seven Dhatus, no whiteness, no redness, no blueness, no heat, no gain,\nneither importance nor non-importance, no delusion, no perseverance, no mystery, no race, nothing to\nbe abandoned or received, nothing to be laughed at, no policy, no religious vow, no fault, no\nbewailments, no happiness, neither knower nor knowledge nor the knowable, no Self, nothing\nbelonging to you or to me, neither you nor I, and neither old age nor youth nor manhood; but I am\ncertainly Brahman. \u2018I am certainly Brahman. I am Chit, I am Chit\u2019.\n30(b)-31. He is said to be a Jivanmukta who cognises: \u2018I am Brahman alone, I am Chit alone, I am the\n\nsupreme\u2019. No doubt need be entertained about this; \u2018I am Hamsa itself, I remain of my own will, I can\nsee myself through myself, I reign happy in the kingdom of Atman and enjoy in myself the bliss of my\nown Atman\u2019.\n32. He is a Jivanmukta who is himself, the foremost and the one undaunted person who is himself the\nlord and rests in his own Self.\n33. He is a Videhamukta who has become Brahman, whose Atman has attained quiescence, who is of\nthe nature of Brahmic bliss, who is happy, who is of a pure nature and who is a great Mouni (observer\nof silence).\n34-37. He is a Videhamukta who remains in Chinmatra alone without (even) thinking thus: \u2018I am all\nAtman, the Atman that is equal (or the same) in all, the pure, without one, the non-dual, the all, the self\nonly, the birthless and the deathless \u2013 I am myself the undecaying Atman that is the object aimed at, the\nsporting, the silent, the blissful, the beloved and the bondless salvation \u2013 I am Brahman alone \u2013 I am\nChit alone\u2019.\n38. He is a Videhamukta who having abandoned the thought: \u2018I alone am the Brahman\u2019 is filled with\nbliss.\n39-47(a). He is a Videhamukta who having given up the certainty of the existence or non-existence of\nall objects is pure Chidananda (the consciousness-bliss), who having abandoned (the thought): \u2018I am\nBrahman\u2019 (or) \u2018I am not Brahman\u2019 does not mingle his Atman with anything, anywhere or at any time,\nwho is ever silent with the silence of Satya, who does nothing, who has gone beyond Gunas, whose\nAtman has become the All, the great and the purifier of the elements, who does not cognise the change\nof time, matter, place, himself or other differences, who does not see (the difference of) \u2018I\u2019, \u2018thou\u2019,\n\u2018this\u2019, or \u2018that\u2019, who being of the nature of time is yet without it, whose Atman is void, subtle and\nuniversal, but yet without (them), whose Atman is divine and yet without Devas, whose Atman is\nmeasurable and yet without measure, whose Atman is without inertness and within every one, whose\nAtman is devoid of any Sankalpa, who thinks always: \u2018I am Chinmatra, I am simply Paramatman, I am\nonly of the nature of spiritual wisdom, I am only of the nature of Sat, I am afraid of nothing in this\nworld\u2019, and who is without the conception of Devas, Vedas and sciences, \u2018All this is consciousness,\netc.,\u2019 and regards all as void.\n47(b)-48. He is a Videhamukta who has realised himself to be Chaitanya alone, who is remaining at\nease in the pleasure-garden of his own Atman, whose Atman is of an illimitable nature, who is without\nconception of the small and the great and who is the fourth of the fourth state and the supreme bliss.\n49-53(a). He is a Videhamukta whose Atman is nameless and formless, who is the great spiritual\nwisdom of the nature of bliss and of the nature of the state beyond Turya, who is neither auspicious nor\ninauspicious, who has Yoga as his Atman, whose Atman is associated with Yoga, who is free from\nbondage or freedom, without Guna or non-Guna, without space, time, etc., without the witnessable and\nthe witness, without the small or the great and without the cognition of the universe or even the\ncognition of the nature of Brahman, but who finds his spiritual effulgence in his own nature, who finds\nbliss in himself, whose bliss is beyond the scope of words and mind and whose thought is beyond the\nbeyond.\n53(b)-54. He is said to be a Videhamukta who has gone beyond (or mastered quite) the modifications of\nChitta, who illumines such modifications and whose Atman is without any modifications at all. In that\ncase, he is neither embodied nor disembodied. If such a thought is entertained (even), for a moment,\nthen he is surrounded (in thought) by all.\n55-62. He is a Videhamukta whose external Atman invisible to others is the supreme bliss aiming at the\nhighest Vedanta, who drinks of the juice of the nectar of Brahman, who has the nectar of Brahman as\nmedicine, who is devoted to the juice of the nectar of Brahman, who is immersed in that juice, who has\nthe beneficent worship of the Brahmic bliss, who is not satiated with the juice of the nectar of\nBrahman, who realises Brahmic bliss, who cognises the Shiva bliss in Brahmic bliss, who has the\neffulgence of the essence of Brahmic bliss, who has become one with it, who lives in the household of\n\nBrahmic bliss, has mounted the car of Brahmic bliss, who has an imponderable Chit being one with it,\nwho is supporting (all), being full of it, who associates with me having it, who stays in Atman having\nthat bliss and who thinks: \u2018All this is of the nature of Atman, there is nothing else beside Atman, all is\nAtman, I am Atman, the great Atman, the supreme Atman and Atman of the form of bliss\u2019.\n63-68(a). He who thinks: \u2018My nature is full, I am the great Atman, I am the all-contented and the\npermanent Atman. I am the Atman pervading the heart of all, which is not stained by anything, but\nwhich has no Atman; I am the Atman whose nature is changeless, I am the quiescent Atman; and I am\nthe many Atman\u2019. He who does not think this is Jivatma and that is Paramatma, whose Atman is of the\nnature of the emancipated and the non-emancipated, but without emancipation or bondage, whose\nAtman is of the nature of the dual and the non-dual one, but without duality and non-duality; whose\nAtman is of the nature of the All and the non-All, but without them; whose Atman is of the nature of\nthe happiness arising from objects obtained and enjoyed, but without it; and who is devoid of any\nSankalpa \u2013 such a man is a Videhamukta.\n68(b)-79. He whose Atman is partless, stainless, enlightened, Purusha, without bliss, etc., of the nature\nof the nectar, of the nature of the three periods of time, but without them; whose Atman is entire and\nnon-measurable, being subject to proof though without proof; whose Atman is the eternal and the\nwitness, but without eternality and witness; whose Atman is of the nature of the secondless, who is the\nself-shining one without a second, whose Atman cannot be measured by Vidya and Avidya but without\nthem; whose Atman is without conditionedness or unconditionedness, who is without this or the higher\nworlds, whose Atman is without the six things beginning with Sama, who is without the qualifications\nof the aspirant after salvation, whose Atman is without gross, subtle, causal and the fourth bodies and\nwithout the Anna, Prana, Manas and Vijnana sheaths; whose Atman is of the nature of Ananda (bliss)\nsheath, but without five sheaths; whose Atman is of the nature of Nirvikalpa, is devoid of Sankalpa,\nwithout the characteristics of the visible or the audible and of the nature of void, owing to unceasing\nSamadhi, who is without beginning, middle, or end; whose Atman is devoid of the word Prajnana, who\nis without the idea \u2018I am Brahman\u2019, whose Atman is devoid (of the thought) of \u2018thou art\u2019, who is\nwithout the thought \u2018this is Atman\u2019, whose Atman is devoid of that which is described by Om, who is\nabove the reach of any speech or the three states and is the indestructible and the Chidatma, whose\nAtman is not the one which can be known by Atman and whose Atman has neither light nor darkness.\nSuch a personage is a Videhamukta.\n80-81. Look only upon Atman; know It as your own. Enjoy your Atman yourself and stay in peace. O\nsix-faced one, be content in your own Atman, be wandering in your own Atman and be enjoying your\nown Atman. Then you will attain Videhamukti\u201d.\nThus ends the fourth chapter.\nCHAPTER - V\nThe sage named Nidagha addressed the venerable Ribhu: \u201cO Lord please explain to me the\ndiscrimination of Atman from non-Atman\u201d. The Sage replied thus:\n1-4(a). \u201cThe furthest limit of all Vak (speech) is Brahman; the furthest limit to all thoughts is the Guru.\nThat which is of the nature of all causes and effects but yet without them, that which is without\nSankalpa, of the nature of all bliss and the auspicious, that which is the great one of the nature of bliss,\nthat which illuminates all luminaries and that which is full of the bliss of Nada (spiritual sound),\nwithout any enjoyment and contemplation and beyond Nadas and Kalas (parts) \u2013 that is Atman, that is\n\u2018I\u2019, the indestructible.\n4(b)-5(a). Being devoid of all the difference of Atman and non-Atman, of heterogeneity and\nhomogeneity and of quiescence and non-quiescence \u2013 that is the one Jyotis at the end of Nada.\n5(b)-6. Being remote from the conception of Maha-Vakyartha (i.e., the meaning of Maha Vakyas) as\nwell of \u2018I am Brahman\u2019, being devoid of or without the conception of the word and the meaning and\nbeing devoid of the conception of the destructible and indestructible \u2013 that is the one Jyotis at the end\n\nof Nada.\n7. Being without the conception \u2018I am the partless non-dual essence\u2019 or \u2018I am the blissful\u2019, and being of\nthe nature of the one beyond all \u2013 \u2018that is one\u2018 Jyotis at the end of Nada.\n8. He who is devoid of the significance of Atman (viz., motion) and devoid of Sachchidananda \u2013 he is\nalone Atman, the eternal.\n9. He who is undefinable and unreachable by the words of the Vedas, who has neither externals nor\ninternals and whose symbol is either the universe or Brahman \u2013 he is undoubtedly Atman.\n10-12(a). He who has no body, nor is a Jiva made up of the elements and their compounds, who has\nneither form nor name, neither the enjoyable nor the enjoyer, neither Sat nor Asat, neither preservation\nnor regeneration, neither Guna nor non-Guna \u2013 that is undoubtedly my Atman.\n12(b)-15(a). He who has neither the described nor description, neither Sravana nor Manana, neither\nGuru nor disciple, neither the world of the Devas nor the Devas nor the Asuras, neither duty nor nonduty, neither the immaculate nor non-immaculate, neither time nor non-time, neither certainty nor\ndoubt, neither Mantra nor non-Mantra, neither science nor non-science, neither the seer nor the sight\nwhich is subtle, nor the nectar of time \u2013 that is Atman.\n15(b)-16(a). Rest assured that not-Atman is a misnomer. There is no Manas as not-Atman. There is no\nworld as not-Atman.\n16(b)-17(a). Owing to the absence of all Sankalpas and to the giving up of all actions, Brahman alone\nremains and there is no not-Atman.\n17(b)-21. Being devoid of the three bodies, the three periods of time, the three Gunas of Jiva, the three\npains and the three worlds and following the saying \u2018All is Brahman\u2019, know that there is nothing to be\nknown through the absence of Chitta; there is no old age through the absence of body; no motion\nthrough the absence of legs; no action through the absence of hands; no death through the absence of\ncreatures; no happiness through the absence of Buddhi; no virtue, no purity, no fear, no repetition of\nMantras, no Guru nor disciple. There is no second in the absence of one. Where there is not the second,\nthere is not the first.\n22. Where there is truth alone, there is no non-truth possible; where there is non-truth alone, there is no\ntruth possible.\n23. If you regard a thing auspicious as inauspicious, then auspiciousness is desired (as separate) from\ninauspiciousness. If you regard fear as non-fear, then fear will arise out of non-fear.\n24. If bondage should become emancipation, then in the absence of bondage will be no emancipation.\nIf birth should imply death, then in the absence of birth, there is no death.\n25. If \u2018thou\u2019 should imply \u2018I\u2019, then in the absence of \u2018thou\u2019 there is no \u2018I\u2019. If \u2018this\u2019 should be \u2018that\u2019,\n\u2018this\u2019 does not exist in the absence of \u2018that\u2019.\n26. If being should imply non-being, then non-being will imply being. If an effect implies a cause, then\nin the absence of effect, there is no cause.\n27. If duality implies non-duality, then in the absence of duality, there is no non-duality. If there should\nbe the seen, then there is the eye (or sight); in the absence of the seen, there is no eye.\n28. In the absence of the interior, there is no exterior. If there should be fullness, then non-fullness is\npossible. Therefore (all) this exists nowhere.\n29. Neither you nor I, nor this nor these exist. There exists no (object of) comparison in the true one.\n30. There is no simile in the unborn. There is (in it) no mind to think. I am the supreme Brahman. This\nworld is Brahman only. Thou and I are Brahman only.\n31. I am Chinmatra simply and there is no not-Atman. Rest assured of it. This universe is not (really at\nall). This universe is not (really) at all. It was nowhere produced and stays nowhere.\n32. Some say that Chitta is the universe. Not at all. It exists not. Neither the universe nor Chitta nor\nAhankara nor Jiva exists (really).\n33-34. Neither the creation of Maya nor Maya itself exists (really). Fear does not (really) exist. Actor,\naction, hearing, thinking, the two Samadhis, the measurer, the measure, Ajnana and Aviveka \u2013 none of\n\nthese exists (truly) anywhere.\n35-38. Therefore the four moving considerations and the three kinds of relationship exist not. There is\nno Ganga, no Gaya, no Setu (bridge), no elements or anything else, no earth, water, fire, Vayu and\nAkasa anywhere, no Devas, no guardians of the four quarters, no Vedas, no Guru, no distance, no\nproximity, no time, no middle, no non-duality, no truth, no untruth, no bondage, no emancipation, no\nSat, no Asat, no happiness, etc., no class, no motion, no caste and no worldly business.\n39. All is Brahman only and nothing else \u2013 all is Brahman only and nothing else. There exists then\nnothing (or Statement) as that \u2018consciousness alone is\u2019; there is (then) no saying such as \u2018Chit is I\u2019.\n40-41. The statement \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 does not exist (then); nor does exist (then) the statement: \u2018I am\nthe eternally pure\u2019. Whatever is uttered by the mouth, whatever is thought by Manas, whatever is\ndetermined by Buddhi, whatever is cognised by Chitta \u2013 all these do not exist. There is no Yogin or\nYoga then. All are and are not.\n42. Neither day nor night, neither bathing nor contemplating, neither delusion nor non-delusion \u2013 all\nthese do not exist then. Know that is no not-Atman.\n43. The Vedas, Sciences, Puranas, effect and cause, Ishvara and the world and the elements and\nmankind \u2013 all these are unreal. There is no doubt of it.\n44. Bondage, salvation, happiness, relatives, meditation, Chitta, the Devas, the demons, the secondary\nand the primary, the high and the low \u2013 all these are unreal. There is no doubt of it.\n45. Whatever is uttered by the mouth, whatever is willed by Sankalpa, whatever is thought by Manas \u2013\nall these are unreal. There is no doubt of it.\n46-47. Whatever is determined by the Buddhi, whatever is cognised by Chitta, whatever is discussed by\nthe religious books, whatever is seen by the eye and heard by the ears and whatever exists as Sat, as\nalso the ear, the eye and the limbs \u2013 all these are unreal.\n48-51(a). Whatever is described as such and such, whatever is thought as so-and-so, all the existing\nthoughts such as \u2018thou art I\u2019, \u2018that is this\u2019, and \u2018He is I\u2019, and whatever happens in Moksha, as also all\nSankalpas, delusion, illusory attribution, mysteries and all the diversities of enjoyment and sin \u2013 all\nthese do not exist. So is also not-Atman. Mine and thine, my and thy, for me and for thee, by me and by\nthee \u2013 all these are unreal.\n51(b)-52(a). (The statement) that Vishnu is the preserver, Brahma is the creator, Rudra is the destroyer\n\u2013 know that these undoubtedly are false.\n52(b)-54(a). Bathing, utterings of Mantras, Japas (religious austerities) Homa (sacrifice), study of the\nVedas, worship of the Devas, Mantra, Tantra, association with the good, the unfolding of the faults of\nGunas, the working of the internal organ, the result of Avidya and the many Crores of mundane eggs \u2013\nall these are unreal.\n54(b)-55. Whatever is spoken of as true according to the verdict of all teachers, whatever is seen in this\nworld and whatever exists \u2013 all these are unreal.\n56-58(a). Whatever is uttered by words, whatever is ascertained, spoken, enjoyed, given or done by\nanyone, whatever action is done, good or bad, whatever is done as truth \u2013 know all these to be unreal.\n58(b)-59. Thou alone art the transcendental Atman and the supreme Guru of the form of Akasa, which\nis devoid of fitness (for it) and of the nature of all creatures. Thou art Brahman; there is no doubt of it.\n60. Thou art time; and thou art Brahman, that is ever and imponderable. Thou art everywhere, of all\nforms and full of consciousness.\n61. Thou art the truth. Thou art one that has mastered the Siddhis and thou art the ancient, the\nemancipated, emancipation, the nectar of bliss, the God, the quiescent, the diseaseless, Brahman the\nfull and greater than the great.\n62-64. Thou art impartial, Sat and the ancient knowledge, recognised by the words \u2018Truth, etc.\u2019. Thou\nart devoid of all parts. Thou art the ever-existing \u2013 thou appearest as Brahma, Rudra, Indra, etc., -- thou\nart above the illusion of the universe \u2013 thou shinest in all elements \u2013 thou art without Sankalpa in all \u2013\nthou art known by means of the underlying meaning of an scriptures; thou art ever content and ever\n\nhappily seated (in thyself); thou art without motion, etc., In all things, thou art without any\ncharacteristics; in all things thou art contemplated by Vishnu and other Devas at all times.\n65-69. Thou hast the nature of Chit, thou art Chinmatra unchecked, thou stayest in Atman itself, thou\nart void of everything and without Gunas, thou art bliss, the great, the one secondless, the state of Sat\nand Asat, the knower, the known, the seer, the nature of Sachchidananda, the lord of Devas, the allpervading, the deathless, the moving, the motionless, the all and the non-all with quiescence and nonquiescence, Sat alone, Sat commonly (found in all), of the form of Nitya-Siddha (the unconditioned\ndeveloped one) and yet devoid of all Siddhis.\n70-73. There is not an atom which thou dost not penetrate; but yet thou art without it. Thou art devoid\nof existence and non-existence as also the aim and object aimed at. Thou art changeless, decayless,\nbeyond all Nadas, without Kala or Kashta (divisions of time) and without Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.\nThou lookest into the nature of each and art above the nature of each. Thou art immersed in the bliss of\nSelf. Thou art the monarch of the kingdom of Self and yet without the conception of Self. Thou art of\nthe nature of fullness and incompleteness.\n74. There is nothing that thou seest which is not in thyself. Thou dost not stir out of thy nature. Thou\nactest according to the nature of each. Thou art nothing but the nature of each. Have no doubt \u2018thou art\nI\u2019.\n75. This universe and everything in it, whether the seer or the seen, resembles the horns of a hare (or an\nillusory).\n76-89(a). Earth, water, Agni, Vayu, Akasa, Manas, Buddhi, Ahankara, Tejas, the worlds and the sphere\nof the universe, destruction, birth, truth, virtue, vice, gain, desires, passion, anger, greed, the object of\nmeditation, wisdom, guru, disciple, limitation, the beginning and end, auspiciousness, the past, present\nand future, the aim and the object of aim, mental restraint, inquiry, contentment, enjoyer, enjoyment,\netc., the eight parts of Yoga, Yama, etc., the going and coming (of life), the beginning, middle and end,\nthat which can be taken and rejected, Hari, Shiva, the organs, Manas, the three states, the twenty-four\nTattvas, the four means, one of the same class or different classes, Bhuh and other worlds, all the castes\nand orders of life with the rules laid down for each, Mantras and Tantras, science and nescience, all the\nVedas, the inert and the non-inert, bondage and salvation, spiritual wisdom and non-wisdom, the\nenlightened and the non-enlightened, duality and non-duality, the conclusion of all Vedantas and\nShastras, the theory of the existence of all souls and that of one soul only, whatever is thought by\nChitta, whatever is willed by Sankalpa, whatever is determined by Buddhi, whatever one hears and\nsees, whatever the guru instructs, whatever is sensed by all the organs, whatever is discussed in\nMimamsa, whatever is ascertained by Nyaya (philosophy) and by the great ones who have reached the\nother side of the Vedas, the saying \u2018Shiva destroys the world, Vishnu protects it and Brahma creates it\u2019,\nwhatever is found in the Puranas, whatever is ascertained by the Vedas and is the signification of all the\nVedas \u2013 all these resemble the horns of a hare.\n89(b). The conception \u2018I am the body\u2019 is spoken of as the internal organ.\n90. The conception \u2018I am the body\u2019 is spoken of as the great mundane existence; the conception \u2018I am\nthe body\u2019 constitutes the whole universe.\n91-96. The conception \u2018I am the body\u2019 is spoken of as the knot of the heart, as non-wisdom, as the state\nof Asat, as nescience, as the dual, as the true Jiva and as with parts, is certainly the great sin and is the\ndisease generated by the fault of thirst after desires.\n97. That which is Sankalpa, the three pains, passion, anger, bondage, all the miseries, all the faults and\nthe various forms of time \u2013 know these to be the result of Manas.\n98-104. Manas alone is the whole world, the ever-deluding, the mundane existence, the three worlds,\nthe great pains, the old age and others, death and the great sin, the Sankalpa, the Jiva, the Chitta, the\nAhankara, the bondage, the internal organ and earth, water, Agni, Vayu and Akasa. Sound,, touch, form,\ntaste and odour, the five sheaths, the waking, the dreaming and dreamless sleeping states, the guardians\nof the eight quarters, Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, the seen, the inert, the pairs and non-wisdom \u2013 all these\n\nare the products of Manas.\n105. Rest assured that there is no reality in all that is Sankalpa. The whole world, the guru, disciple,\netc., do not exist, yea, do not exist.\nThus ends the fifth chapter.\nCHAPTER - VI\n1-9(a). Ribhu continued again: \u201cKnow everything as Sachchinmaya (full of sat and consciousness). It\npervades everything. Sachchidananda is non-dual, decayless, alone and other than all. It is \u2018I\u2019. It alone\nis Akasa and \u2018thou\u2019. It is I. There is (in it) no Manas, no Buddhi, no Ahankara, no Chitta, or the\ncollection of these \u2013 neither \u2018thou\u2019 nor I, nor anything else nor everything. Brahman alone is. Sentence,\nwords, Vedas, letters, beginning, middle or end, truth, law, pleasure, pain, existence, Maya, Prakriti,\nbody, face, nose, tongue, palate, teeth, lip, forehead, expiration and inspiration, sweat, bone, blood,\nurine, distance, proximity, limb, belly, crown, the movement of hands and feet, Shastras, command, the\nknower, the known and the knowledge, the waking, dreaming and dreamless sleeping and the fourth\nstate \u2013 all these do not belong to me. Everything is Sachchinmaya interwoven.\n9(b)-29. No attributes pertaining to body, elements and spirit, no root, no vision, no taijasa, no Prajna,\nno Virat, no Sutratma, no Ishvara and no going or coming, neither gain nor loss, neither the acceptable\nnor the rejectable, nor the censurable, neither the pure nor the impure, neither the stout nor the lean, no\nsorrow, time, space, speech, all, fear, duality, tree, grass or mountain, no meditation, no Siddhi of Yoga,\nno Brahmana, Kshatriya or Vaishya, no bird or beast, or limb, no greed, delusion, pride, malice,\npassion, anger or others, no woman, Sudra, castes or others, nothing that is eatable or enjoyable, no\nincrease or decrease, no belief in the Vedas, no speech, no worldliness or unworldliness, no transaction,\nno folly, no measure or measured, no enjoyment or enjoyed, no friends, son, etc., father, mother, or\nsister, no birth or death, no growth, body or \u2018I\u2019, no emptiness or fullness, no internal organs or mundane\nexistence, no night, no day, no Brahma, Vishnu, or Shiva, no week, fortnight, month, or year, no\nunsteadiness, no Brahmaloka, Vaikuntha, Kailasa and others, no Swarga, Indra, Agniloka, Agni,\nYamaloka, Yama, Vayuloka, guardians of the world, three worlds \u2013 Bhuh, Bhuvah, Svah, Patala or\nsurface of earth, no science, nescience, Maya, Prakriti, inertness, permanency, transience, destruction,\nmovement, running, object of meditation, bathing, Mantra or object, no adorable object, anointment or\nsipping with water, no flower, fruit, sandal, light waved before god, praise, prostrations or\ncircumambulation, no entreaty conception of separateness even, oblation of food, offered food,\nsacrifice, actions, abuse, praise, Gayatri and Sandhi (period of junction, such as twilight, etc.,), no\nmental state, calamity, evil desire, bad soul, Chandala (low caste person), Pulkasa, unbearableness,\nunspeakableness, Kirata (hunter), Kaitava (demon), partiality, partisanship, ornament, chief, or pride,\nno manyness, no oneness, durability, triad, tetrad, greatness, smallness, fullness, or delusion, no\nKaitava, Benares, Tapas, clan, family, Sutra, greatness, poverty, girl, old woman or widow, no\npollution, birth, introvision or illusion, no sacred sentences, identity, or the Siddhis, Anima, etc.\n30. Everything being consciousness alone, there is no fault in anything. Everything being of the nature\nof Sat alone, is Sachchidananda only.\n31. Brahman alone is everything and there is nothing else. So \u2018That\u2019 is \u2018I\u2019, \u2018That\u2019 is \u2018I\u2019, \u2018That\u2019 alone is\n\u2018I\u2019. \u2018That\u2019 alone is \u2018I\u2019. \u2018That\u2018 alone is \u2018I\u2019. The eternal Brahman alone is \u2018I\u2019.\n32-33. I am Brahman alone without being subject to mundane existence. I am Brahman alone without\nany Manas, any Buddhi, organs or body. I am Brahman alone not perceivable. I am Brahman alone and\nnot Jiva. I am Brahman alone and not liable to change.\n34. I am Brahman alone and not inert. I am Brahman alone and have no death. I am Brahman alone and\nhave no Pranas. I am Brahman alone and greater than the great.\n35. This is Brahman. Great is Brahman. Truth is Brahman. It is all-pervading. Time is Brahman. Kala is\nBrahman. Happiness is Brahman. It is self-shining.\n36. One is Brahman. Two is Brahman. Delusion is Brahman. Sama and others are Brahman. Badness is\n\nBrahman. Goodness is Brahman. It is of the form of restraint, quiescence, the all-pervading and the allpowerful.\n37. The Loka (world) is Brahman. Guru is Brahman. Disciple is Brahman. It is Sadashiva. (That which)\nis before is Brahman. (That which will be) hereafter is Brahman. Purity is Brahman. Auspiciousness\nand inauspiciousness are Brahman.\n38. Jiva always is Brahman. I am Sachchidananda. All are of the nature of Brahman. The universe is\nsaid to be of the nature of Brahman.\n39. Brahman is Itself (Svayam). There is no doubt of it. There is nothing out of itself. The letter Om of\nthe form of consciousness is Brahman alone. Everything is itself.\n40-45. I alone am the whole universe and the highest seat, have crossed the Gunas and am greater than\nthe great, the supreme Brahman, Guru of Gurus, the support of all and the bliss of bliss. There is no\nuniverse besides Atman. The universe is of the nature of Atman.\n46-52(a). There is nowhere (or no place) without Atman. There is not even grass different from Atman.\nThere is not husk different from Brahman. The whole universe is of the nature of Atman. All this is of\nthe nature of Brahman. Asat is not of the nature of Brahman. There is not a grass different from\nBrahman. There is not a seat different from Brahman; there is not a Guru different from Brahman; there\nis nor a body different from Brahman. There is nothing different from Brahman like I-ness or you-ness.\n52(b)-57. Whatever is seen in this world, whatever is spoken of by the people, whatever is enjoyed\neverywhere \u2013 all these are Asat (unreal) only. The differences arising from the actor, action, qualities,\nlikes, taste and gender \u2013 all these arise from Asat and are (but) pleasurable. The differences arising\nfrom time, objects, actions, success or defeat and whatever else \u2013 all these are simply Asat. The internal\norgan is Asat. The organs are Asat. All the Pranas, the collections of all these, the five sheaths, the five\ndeities, the six changes, the six enemies, the six seasons and the six tastes are Asat.\n58. I am Sachchidananda. The universe is rootless. I am Atman alone, Chit and Ananda. The scenes of\nmundane existence are not different.\n59. I am the Truth of the nature of Ananda and the nature of the imponderable Chit.\n60. All this is of the nature of Jnana. I am the secondless, having Jnana and bliss. I am of the nature of\nan illuminator of all things. I am of the nature of all non-being.\n61-63. I alone shine always. Therefore how can I with such a nature become Asat ? That which is called\n\u2018thou\u2019 is the great Brahman of the nature of the bliss of consciousness and of the nature of Chit having\nChidakasha and Chit alone as the great bliss. Atman alone is \u2018I\u2019. Asat is not \u2018I\u2019. I am Kutastha, the great\nguru and Sachchidananda alone. I am this born universe. No time, no universe, no Maya, no Prakriti (in\nme).\n64. I alone am the Hari. Personally, I alone am the Sadashiva. I am of the nature of pure consciousness.\nI am the enjoyer of pure Sattva.\n65-71. I am the only essence full of Chit. Everything is Brahman and Brahman alone. Everything is\nBrahman and is Chit alone. I am of the nature of the all-latent and the all-witness. I am the supreme\nAtman, the supreme Jyotis, the supreme wealth, the supreme goal, the essence of all Vedantas, the\nsubject discussed in all the Shastras the nature of Yogic bliss, the ocean of the chief bliss, the brightness\nof all wisdom, of the nature of chief wisdom, the brightness of the fourth state and the non-fourth but\ndevoid of them, the indestructible Chit, truth, Vasudeva, the birthless and the deathless Brahma,\nChidakasha, the unconditioned, the stainless, the immaculate, the emancipated, the utterly emancipated,\nthe soulless, the formless and of the nature of the non-created universe. The universe which is assumed\nas truth and non-truth does not really exist.\n72. Brahman is of the nature of eternal bliss and is even by itself. It is endless, decayless, quiescent and\nof one nature only.\n73-75. If anything is other than myself, then it is as unreal as the mirage in an oasis. If one should be\nafraid of the son of a barren woman, or if a powerful elephant be killed by means of the horns of a hare,\nthen the world (really is). If one (person) can quench his thirst by drinking the waters of the mirage, or\n\nif one should be killed by the horns of a man, then the universe really is. The universe exists always in\nthe true Gandharva city (merely unreal).\n76-98. When the blueness of the sky really exists in it, then the universe really is. When the silver in\nmother-of pearl can be used in making an ornament, when a man is bitten by (the conception of) a\nsnake in a rope, when the flaming fire is quenched by means of a golden arrow, when milky food is\nobtained in the (barren) forest of Vindhya (mountains), when cooking can take place by means of the\nfuel of (wet) plantain trees, when a female (baby) just born begins to cook, when curds resume the state\nof milk, or when the milk (milked) goes back through the teats of a cow, then will the universe really\nbe. When the dust of the earth shall be produced in the ocean, when the maddened elephant is tied by\nmeans of the hair of a tortoise, when (mountain) Meru is shaken by the thread in the stalk of a lotus,\nwhen the ocean is bound by its rows of tides, when the fire flames downwards, when flame shall\nbecome (really) cold, when the lotus shall grow out of flaming fire, when Indranila (sapphire) arises in\nthe great mountains, when Meru comes and sits in the lotus-eye, when a mountain can become the\noffspring of a black bee, when Meru shall shake, when a lion is killed by goat, when the three worlds\ncan be found in the space of the hollow of an atom, when the fire which burns a straw shall last for a\nlong time, when the objects seen in a dream shall come in the waking state, when the current of a river\nshall stand still (of itself), when the delivery of a barren woman shall be fruitful, when the crow shall\nwalk like a swan, when the mule shall fight with a lion, when a great ass shall walk like an elephant,\nwhen the full moon shall become a sun, when Rahu (one of the nodes) shall abandon the sun and the\nmoon, when a good crop shall arise out of the waste (burnt) seeds, when the poor shall enjoy the\nhappiness of the rich, when the lions shall be conquered by the bravery of dogs, when the heart of\nJnanis is known by fools, when the ocean is drunk by the dogs without any remainder, when the pure\nAkasa shall fall upon men, when heaven shall fall on the earth, when the flower in the sky shall emit\nfragrance, when a forest appearing in pure Akasa shall move and when reflection shall arise in a glass\nsimply (without mercury or anything else in its back), then the world really is.\n99. There is no universe in the womb of Aja (the unborn Brahman) \u2013 there is no universe in the womb\nof Atman. Duality and non-duality, which are but the results of differentiation, are really not.\n100. All this is the result of Maya. Therefore, there should be Brahma-Bhavana. If misery should arise\nfrom the conception of \u2018I am the body\u2019, then it is certain \u2018I am Brahman\u2019.\n101. The knot of the heart is the wheel of Brahman, which cuts asunder the knot of existence. When\ndoubt arises in one, he should have faith in Brahman.\n102. That non-dual Brahman, which is eternal and of the form of unconditioned bliss, is the guard of\nAtman against the chief of the form of not-Atman.\n103. Through instances like the above is established the nature of Brahman. Brahman alone is the allabode. Abandon the name even of the universe.\n104. Knowing for certain \u2018I am Brahman\u2019, give up the \u2018I\u2019. Everything disappears as the flower from the\nhands of a sleeping person.\n105. There is neither body nor Karma. Everything is Brahman alone. There are neither objects, nor\nactions, nor the four states.\n106. Everything which has the three characteristics of Vijnana is Brahman alone. Abandoning all\naction, contemplate:\n107. \u2018I am Brahman\u2019, \u2018I am Brahman\u2019. There is no doubt of this. I am Brahman of the nature of Chit. I\nam of the nature of Sachchidananda.\n108. This great science of Shankara should never be explained to any ordinary person, to an atheist or\nto a faithless, ill-behaved or evil-minded person.\n109. It should be, after due examination, given to the high-souled ones whose minds are purified with\ndevotion to their gurus. It should be taught for a year and a half.\n110. Leaving off thoroughly and entirely the practice recommended by the (other) Upanishads, one\nshould study the Tejobindu Upanishad always with delight.\n\n111. By once studying it, he becomes one with Brahman.\nThus ends the sixth chapter.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Tejobindu Upanishad, as contained in the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",

The syllable \u2018A\u2019 is considered to be its (the bird Om\u2019s) right wing, \u2018Upanishad\u2019, its left; \u2018M\u2019, its tail;\nand the Ardha-Matra (half-metre) is said to be its head.\n2. The (Rajasic and Tamasic) qualities, its feet upwards (to the loins); Sattva, its (main) body; Dharma\nis considered to be its right eye, and Adharma, its left.\n3. The Bhur-Loka is situated in its feet; the Bhuvar-Loka, in its knees; the Suvar-Loka, in its loins; and\nthe Mahar-Loka, in its navel.\n4. In its heart is situate the Janoloka; Tapoloka in its throat and the Satya-Loka in the centre of the\nforehead between the eyebrows.\n5(a). Then the Matra (or Mantra) beyond the Sahasrara (thousand-rayed) is explained (viz.,) should be\nexplained.\n5(b)-6(a). An adept in Yoga who bestrides the Hamsa (bird) thus (viz., contemplates on Om) is not\naffected by Karmic influences or by tens of Crores of sins.\n\n6(b)-7. The first Matra has Agni as its Devata (presiding deity); the second, Vayu as its Devata; the next\nMatra is resplendent like the sphere of the sun and the last, Ardha-Matra the wise know as belonging to\nVaruna (the presiding deity of water).\n8. Each of these Matras has indeed three Kalas (parts). This is called Omkara. Know it by means of the\nDharanas, viz., concentration on each of the twelve Kalas (or the variations of the Matras produced by\nthe difference of Svaras or intonation).\n9-11. The first Matra is called Ghoshini; the second, Vidyunmali (or Vidyunmatra); the third, Patangini;\nthe fourth, Vayuvegini; the fifth, Namadheya; the sixth, Aindri; the seventh, Vaishnavi; the eighth,\nSankari; the ninth, Mahati; the tenth, Dhriti (Dhruva); the eleventh, Nari (Mauni); and the twelfth,\nBrahmi.\n12. If a person happens to die in the first Matra (while contemplating on it), he is born again as a great\nemperor in Bharatavarsha.\n13. If in the second Matra, he becomes an illustrious Yaksha; if in the third Matra, a Vidyadhara; if in\nthe fourth, a Gandharva (these three being the celestial hosts).\n14. If he happens to die in the fifth, viz., Ardha-Matra, he lives in the world of the moon, with the rank\nof a Deva greatly glorified there.\n15. If in the sixth, he merges, into Indra; if in the seventh, he reaches the seat of Vishnu; if in the eighth,\nRudra, the Lord of all creatures.\n16. If in the ninth, in Mahar-Loka; if in the tenth, in Janoloka (Dhruva-Loka -- ?); if in the eleventh,\nTapoloka, and if in the twelfth, he attains the eternal state of Brahma.\n17. That which is beyond these, (viz.,) Para-Brahman which is beyond (the above Matras), the pure, the\nall-pervading, beyond Kalas, the ever resplendent and the source of all Jyotis (light) should be known.\n18. When the mind goes beyond the organs and the Gunas and is absorbed, having no separate\nexistence and no mental action, then (the Guru) should instruct him (as to his further course of\ndevelopment).\n19. That person always engaged in its contemplation and always absorbed in it should gradually leave\noff his body (or family) following the course of Yoga and avoiding all intercourse with society.\n20. Then he, being freed from the bonds of karma and the existence as a Jiva and being pure, enjoys the\nsupreme bliss by his attaining of the state of Brahma.\n21. O intelligent man, spend your life always in the knowing of the supreme bliss, enjoying the whole\nof your Prarabdha (that portion of past Karma now being enjoyed) without making any complaint (of\nit).\n22-23(a). Even after Atma-Jnana (knowledge of Atman or Self) has awakened (in one), Prarabdha does\nnot leave (him); but he does not feel Prarabdha after the dawning of Tattva-Jnana (knowledge of Tattva\nor truth) because the body and other things are Asat (unreal), like the things seen in a dream to one on\nawaking from it.\n23(b)-24. That (portion of the) Karma which is done in former births and called Prarabdha does not at\nall affect the person (Tattva-Jnani), as there is no rebirth to him. As the body that exists in the dreaming\nstate is untrue, so is this body.\n25(a). Where then is rebirth to a thing that is illusory ? How can a thing have any existence, when there\nis no birth (to it) ?\n25(b)-26(a). As the clay is the material cause of the pot so one learns from Vedanta that Ajnana is the\nmaterial cause of the universe and when Ajnana ceases to exist, where then is the cosmos ?\n26(b)-27. As a person through illusion mistakes a rope for a serpent, so the fool not knowing Satya (the\neternal truth) sees the world (to be true). When he knows it to be a piece of rope, the illusory idea of a\nserpent vanishes.\n28-29(a). So when he knows the eternal substratum of everything and all the universe becomes\n(therefore) void (to him), where then is Prarabdha to him, the body being a part of the world ?\nTherefore the word Prarabdha is accepted to enlighten the ignorant (only).\n\n29(b)-30. Then as Prarabdha has, in course of time, worn out, he who is the sound resulting from the\nunion of Pranava with Brahman who is the absolute effulgence itself, and who is the bestower of all\ngood, shines himself like the sun at the dispersion of the clouds.\n31. The Yogin being in the Siddhasana (posture) and practising the Vaishnavi-Mudra, should always\nhear the internal sound through the right ear.\n32. The sound which he thus practises makes him deaf to all external sounds. Having overcome all\nobstacles, he enters the Turya state within fifteen days.\n33. In the beginning of his practice, he hears many loud sounds. They gradually increase in pitch and\nare heard more and more subtly.\n34. At first, the sounds are like those proceeding from the ocean, clouds, kettle-drum and cataracts; in\nthe middle (stage) those proceeding from Mardala (a musical instrument), bell and horn.\n35. At the last stage, those proceeding from tinkling bells, flute, Vina (a musical instrument) and bees.\nThus he hears many such sounds more and more subtle.\n36. When he comes to that stage when the sound of the great kettle-drum is being heard, he should try\nto distinguish only sounds more and more subtle.\n37. He may change his concentration from the gross sound to the subtle, or from the subtle to the gross,\nbut he should not allow his mind to be diverted from them towards others.\n38. The mind having at first concentrated itself on any one sound fixes firmly to that and is absorbed in\nit.\n39. It (the mind) becoming insensible to the external impressions, becomes one with the sound as milk\nwith water and then becomes rapidly absorbed in Chidakasa (the Akasa where Chit prevails).\n40. Being indifferent towards all objects, the Yogin having controlled his passions, should by continual\npractice concentrate his attention upon the sound which destroys the mind.\n41. Having abandoned all thoughts and being freed from all actions, he should always concentrate his\nattention on the sound and (then) his Chitta becomes absorbed in it.\n42-43(a). Just as the bee drinking the honey (alone) does not care for the odour, so the Chitta which is\nalways absorbed in sound, does not long for sensual objects, as it is bound by the sweet smell of Nada\nand has abandoned its flitting nature.\n43(b)-44(a). The serpent Chitta through listening to the Nada is entirely absorbed in it and becoming\nunconscious of everything concentrates itself on the sound.\n44(b)-45(a). The sound serves the purpose of a sharp goad to control the maddened elephant \u2013 Chitta\nwhich roves in the pleasure-garden of the sensual objects.\n45(b)-46(a). It serves the purpose of a snare for binding the deer \u2013 Chitta. It also serves the purpose of a\nshore to the ocean waves of Chitta.\n46(b)-47(a). The sound proceeding from Pranava which is Brahman is of the nature of effulgence; the\nmind becomes absorbed in it; that is the supreme seat of Vishnu.\n47(b)-48(a). The sound exists till there is the Akasic conception (Akasa-Sankalpa). Beyond this, is the\n(Asabda) soundless Para-Brahman which is Paramatman.\n48(b). The mind exists so long as there is sound, but with its (sound\u2019s cessation) there is the state called\nUnmani of Manas (viz., the state of being above the mind).\n49(a). This sound is absorbed in the Akshara (indestructible) and the soundless state is the supreme\nseat.\n49(b)-50(a). The mind which along with Prana (Vayu) has (its) Karmic affinities destroyed by the\nconstant concentration upon Nada is absorbed in the unstained One. There is no doubt of it.\n50(b)-51(a). Many myriads of Nadas and many more of Bindus \u2013 (all) become absorbed in the BrahmaPranava sound.\n51(b)-52(a). Being freed from all states and all thoughts whatever, the Yogin remains like one dead. He\nis a Mukta. There is no doubt about this.\n52(b). After that, he does not at any time hear the sounds of conch or Dundubhi (large kettle drum).\n\n53. The body in the state of Unmani is certainly like a log and does not feel heat or cold, joy or sorrow.\n54. The Yogin\u2019s Chitta having given up fame or disgrace is in Samadhi above the three states.\n55. Being freed from the waking and the sleeping states, he attains to his true state.\n56. When the (spiritual) sight becomes fixed without any object to be seen, when the Vayu (Prana)\nbecomes still without any effort, and when the Chitta becomes firm without any support, he becomes of\nthe form of the internal sound of Brahma-Pranava.\nSuch is the Upanishad.\nOm !

Even if sin should accumulate to a mountain extending over many Yojanas (distance), it is destroyed\nby Dhyana-Yoga. At no time has been found a destroyer of sins like this.\n2. Bijakshara (seed-letter) is the supreme Bindu. Nada (spiritual sound) is above it. When that Nada\nceases along with letter, then the Nada-less is supreme state.\n3. The Yogin who considers as the highest that which is above Nada, which is Anahata, has all his\ndoubts destroyed.\n4. If the point of a hair be divided into one hundred thousand parts, this (Nada) is one-half of that still\nfurther divided; and when (even) this is absorbed, the Yogin attains to the stainless Brahman.\n5-6. One who is of a firm mind and without the delusion (of sensual pleasures) and ever resting in\nBrahman, should see like the string (in a rosary of beads) all creatures (as existing) in Atman like odour\nin flowers, ghee in milk, oil in gingelly seeds and gold in quartz.\n7. Again just as the oil depends for its manifestation upon gingelly seeds and odour upon flowers, so\ndoes the Purusha depend for its existence upon the body, both external and internal.\n8. The tree is with parts and its shadow is without parts but with and without parts, Atman exists\neverywhere.\n9(a). The one Akshara (letter OM) should be contemplated upon as Brahman by all who aspire for\nemancipation.\n9(b)-10(a). Prithvi, Agni, Rig-Veda, Bhuh and Brahma -- all these (are absorbed) when Akara (A), the\nfirst Amsa (part) of Pranava (OM) becomes absorbed.\n10(b)-11(a). Antariksha, Yajur-Veda, Vayu, Bhuvah and Vishnu, the Janardana \u2013 all these (are absorbed)\n\nwhen Ukara (U), the second Amsa of Pranava becomes absorbed.\n11(b)-12(a). Dyur, sun, Sama-Veda, Suvah and Maheshvara \u2013 all these (are absorbed) when Makara\n(M), the third Amsa of Pranava becomes absorbed.\n12(b)-13(a). Akara is of (Pita) yellow colour and is said to be of Rajo-Guna; Ukara is of white colour\nand of Sattva-Guna; Makara is of dark colour and of Tamo-Guna.\n13(b)-14(a). He who does not know Omkara as having eight Angas (parts), four Padas (feet), three\nSthanas (seats) and five Devatas (presiding deities) is not a Brahmana.\n14(b)-15. Pranava is the bow. Atman is the arrow and Brahman is said to be the aim. One should aim at\nit with great care and then he, like the arrow, becomes one with It. When that Highest is cognised, all\nKarmas return (from him, viz., do not affect him).\n16. The Vedas have Omkara as their cause. The Swaras (sounds) have Omkara as their cause. The three\nworlds with (all) the locomotive and the fixed (ones in them) have Omkara as their cause.\n17. The short (accent of OM) burns all sins, the long one is decayless and the bestower of prosperity.\nUnited with Ardha-Matra (half-metre of OM), the Pranava becomes the bestower of salvation.\n18. That man is the knower of the Vedas who knows that the end (viz., Ardha-Matra) of Pranava should\nbe worshipped (or recited) as uninterrupted as the flow of oil and (resounding) as long as the sound of a\nbell.\n19. One should contemplate upon Omkara as Ishvara resembling an unshaken light, as of the size of a\nthumb and as motionless in the middle of the pericarp of the lotus of the heart.\n20. Taking in Vayu through the left nostril and filling the stomach with it, one should contemplate upon\nOmkara as being in the middle of the body and as surrounded by circling flames.\n21. Brahma is said to be inspiration, Vishnu is said to be cessation (of breath) and Rudra is said to be\nexpiration. These are the Devatas of Pranayama.\n22. Having made Atman as the (lower) Arani (sacrificial wood) and Pranava as the upper Arani, one\nshould see the God in secret through the practice of churning which is Dhyana.\n23. One should practise restraint of breath as much as it lies in his power along with (the uttering of)\nOmkara sound, until it ceases completely.\n24. Those who look upon OM as of the form of Hamsa staying in all, shining like Crores of suns, being\nalone, staying in Gamagama (ever going and coming) and being devoid of motion \u2013 at last such persons\nare freed from sin.\n25. That Manas which is the author of the actions (viz.,) creation, preservation and destruction of the\nthree worlds, is (then) absorbed (in the supreme One). That is the highest state of Vishnu.\n26. The lotus of the heart has eight petals and thirty-two filaments. The sun is in its midst; the moon is\nin the middle of the sun.\n27. Agni is in the middle of the moon; the Prabha (spiritual light) is in the middle of Agni. Pitha (seat or\ncentre) is in the midst of Prabha, being set in diverse gems.\n28-29. One should meditate upon the stainless Lord Vasudeva as being (seated) upon the centre of\nPitha, as having Srivatsa (black mark) and Kaustubha (garland of gems) on his chest and as adorned\nwith gems and pearls resembling pure crystal in lustre and as resembling Crores of moons in\nbrightness. He should meditate upon Maha-Vishnu as above or in the following manner.\n30-31. (That is) he should meditate with inspiration (of breath) upon Maha-Vishnu as resembling the\nAtasi flower and as staying in the seat of navel with four hands; then with restraint of breath, he should\nmeditate in the heart upon Brahma, the Grandfather as being on the lotus with the Gaura (pale-red)\ncolour of gems and having four faces;\n32-34(a). Then through expiration, he should meditate upon the three-eyed Shiva between the two\neyebrows shining like the pure crystal, being stainless, destroying all sins, being in that which is like\nthe lotus facing down with its flower (or face) below and the stalk above or like the flower of a plantain\ntree, being of the form of all Vedas, containing one hundred petals and one hundred leaves and having\nthe pericarp full-expanded.\n\n34(b)-35. There he should meditate upon the sun, the moon and the Agni, one above another. Passing\nabove through the lotus which has the brightness of the sun, moon and Agni and taking its Hrim Bija\n(letter), one leads his Atman firmly.\n36. He is the knower of Vedas who knows the three seats, the three Matras, the three Brahmas, the three\nAksharas (letters) and the three Matras associated with the Ardha-Matra.\n37. He who knows that which is above Bindu, Nada and Kala as uninterrupted as the flow of oil and\n(resounding) as long as the sound of a bell \u2013 that man is a knower of the Vedas.\n38. Just as a man would draw up (with his mouth) the water through the (pores of the) lotus-stalk, so\nthe Yogin treading the path of Yoga should draw up the breath.\n39. Having made the lotus-sheath of the form of Ardha-Matra, one should draw up the breath through\nthe stalk (of the Nadis Susumna, Ida and Pingala) and absorb it in the middle of the eyebrows.\n40. He should know that the middle of the eyebrows in the forehead which is also the root of the nose is\nthe seat of nectar. That is the great place of Brahman.\n41. Postures, restraint of breath, subjugation of the senses, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi are the six\nparts of Yoga.\n42. There are as many postures as there are living creatures; and Maheshvara (the great Lord) knows\ntheir distinguishing features.\n43. Siddha, Bhadra, Simha and Padma are the four (chief) postures. Muladhara is the first Chakra.\nSvadhisthana is the second.\n44. Between these two is said to be the seat of Yoni (perineum), having the form of Kama (God of\nlove). In the Adhara of the anus, there is the lotus of four petals.\n45-46. In its midst is said to be the Yoni called Kama and worshipped by the Siddhas. In the midst of\nthe Yoni is the Linga facing the west and split at its head like the gem. He who knows this, is a knower\nof the Vedas.\n47. A four-sided figure is situated above Agni and below the genital organ, of the form of molten gold\nand shining like streaks of lightning. Prana is with its Sva (own) sound, having Svadhisthana as its\nAdhisthana (seat), (or since Sva or Prana arises from it).\n48. The Chakra Svadhisthana is spoken of as the genital organ itself. The Chakra in the sphere of the\nnavel is called Manipuraka, since the body is pierced through by Vayu like Manis (gems) by string.\n49-50(a). The Jiva (ego) urged to actions by its past virtuous and sinful Karmas whirls about in this\ngreat Chakra of twelve spokes, so long as it does not grasp the truth.\n50(b). Above the genital organ and below the navel is Kanda of the shape of a bird\u2019s egg.\n51. There arise (from it) Nadis seventy-two thousand in number. Of these seventy-two are generally\nknown.\n52-53. Of these, the chief ones are ten and carry the Pranas. Ida, Pingala, Susumna, Gandhari,\nHastijihva, Pusha, Yasasvini, Alambusa, Kuhuh and Sankhini are said to be the ten.\n54-55(a). This Chakra of the Nadis should ever be known by the Yogins. The three Nadis Ida, Pingala\nand Susumna are said to carry Prana always and have as their Devatas, moon, sun and Agni.\n55(b)-56(a). Ida is on the left side and Pingala on the right side, while the Susumna is in the middle.\nThese three are known to be the paths of Prana.\n56(b)-57. Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana and Vyana; Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya;\nof these, the first five are called Pranas, etc., and last five Naga, etc., are called Vayus (or sub-Pranas).\n58. All these are situated (or run along) the one thousand Nadis, (being) in the form of (or producing)\nlife. Jiva which is under the influence of Prana and Apana goes up and down.\n59-60(a). Jiva on account of its ever moving by the left and right paths is not visible. Just as a ball\nstruck down (on the earth) with the bat of the hand springs up, so Jiva ever tossed by Prana and Apana\nis never at rest.\n60(b)-61(a). He is knower of Yoga who knows that Prana always draws itself from Apana and Apana\ndraws itself from Prana, like a bird (drawing itself from and yet not freeing itself) from the string (to\n\nwhich it is tied).\n61(b)-63. The Jiva comes out with the letter \u2018Ha\u2019 and gets in again with the letter \u2018Sa\u2019. Thus Jiva\nalways utters the Mantra \u2018Hamsa\u2019, \u2018Hamsa\u2019. The Jiva always utters the Mantra twenty-one thousand\nand six hundred times in one day and night. This is called Ajapa Gayatri and is ever the bestower of\nNirvana to the Yogins.\n64-66(a). Through its very thought, man is freed from sins. Neither in the past nor in the future is there\na science equal to this, a Japa equal to this or a meritorious action equal to this. Parameshvari (viz.,\nKundalini Sakti) sleeps shutting with her mouth that door which leads to the decayless Brahma-hole.\n66(b)-68. Being aroused by the contact of Agni with Manas and Prana, she takes the form of a needle\nand pierces up through Susumna. The Yogin should open with great effort this door which is shut. Then\nhe will pierce the door to salvation by means of Kundalini.\n69. Folding firmly the fingers of the hands, assuming firmly the Padma posture, placing the chin firmly\non the breast and fixing the mind in Dhyana, one should frequently raise up the Apana, fill up with air\nand then leave the Prana. Then the wise man gets matchless wisdom through (this) Sakti.\n70. That Yogin who assuming Padma posture worships (i.e., controls) Vayu at the door of the Nadis and\nthen performs restraint of breath is released without doubt.\n71-72. Rubbing off the limbs the sweat arising from fatigue, abandoning all acid, bitter and saltish\n(food), taking delight in the drinking of milk and Rasa, practising celibacy, being moderate in eating\nand ever bent on Yoga, the Yogin becomes a Siddha in little more than a year. No inquiry need be made\nconcerning the result.\n73. Kundalini Sakti, when it is up in the throat, makes the Yogi get Siddhi. The union of Prana and\nApana has the extinction of urine and faeces.\n74-75(a). One becomes young even when old through performing Mula-Bandha always. Pressing the\nYoni by means of the heels and contracting the anus and drawing up the Apana \u2013 this is called MulaBandha.\n75(b)-76. Uddiyana Bandha is so called because it is (like) a great bird that flies up always without rest.\nOne should bring the western part of the stomach above the navel.\n77. This Uddiyana Bandha is a lion to the elephant of death, since it binds the water (or nectar) of the\nAkasa which arises in the head and flows down.\n78-79(a). The Jalandhara Bandha is the destroyer of all the pains of the throat. When this Jalandhara\nBandha which is destroyer of the pains of the throat is performed, then nectar does not fall on Agni nor\ndoes the Vayu move.\n79(b)-80(a). When the tongue enters backwards into the hole of the skull, then there is the Mudra of\nvision latent in the eyebrow called Khechari.\n80(b)-81(a). He who knows the Mudra Khechari has not disease, death, sleep, hunger, thirst, or swoon.\n81(b)-83(a). He who practises this Mudra is not affected by illness or Karma; nor is he bound by the\nlimitations of time. Since Chitta moves in the Kha (Akasa) and since the tongue has entered (in the\nMudra) Kha (viz., the hole in the mouth). Therefore the Mudra is called Khechari and worshipped by\nthe Siddhas.\n83(b)-84. He whose hole (or passage) above the Uvula is closed (with the tongue backwards) by means\nof Khechari-Mudra never loses his virility, even when embraced by a lovely woman. Where is the fear\nof death, so long as the Bindu (virility) stays in the body.\n85-86(a). Bindu does not go out of the body, so long as the Khechari-Mudra is practised. (Even) when\nBindu comes down to the sphere of the perineum, it goes up, being prevented and forced up by violent\neffort through Yoni-Mudra.\n86(b)-87. This Bindu is twofold, white and red. The white one is called Sukla and the red one is said to\ncontain much Rajas. The Rajas which stays in Yoni is like the colour of a coral.\n88. The Bindu stays in the seat of the genital organs. The union of these two is very rare. Bindu is Shiva\nand Rajas is Sakti. Bindu is the moon and Rajas is the sun.\n\n89-90(a). Through the union of these two is attained the highest body; when Rajas is roused up by\nagitating the Sakti through Vayu which unites with the sun, thence is produced the divine form.\n90(b)-92. Sukla being united with the moon and Rajas with the sun, he is a knower of Yoga who knows\nthe proper mixture of these two. The cleansing of the accumulated refuse, the unification of the sun and\nthe moon and the complete drying of the Rasas (essences), this is called Maha-Mudra.\n93. Placing the chin on the breast, pressing the anus by means of the left heel and seizing (the toe of)\nthe extended right leg by the two hands, one should fill his belly (with air) and should slowly exhale.\nThis is called Maha-Mudra, the destroyer of the sins of men.\n94. Now I shall give a description of Atman. In the seat of the heart is a lotus of eight petals. In its\ncentre is Jivatma of the form of Jyotis and atomic in size, moving in a circular line. In it is located\neverything. In knows everything. It does everything. It does all these actions attributing everything to\nits own power, (thinking) I do, I enjoy, I am happy, I am miserable, I am blind, I am lame, I am deaf, I\nam mute, I am lean, I am stout, etc. When it rests on the eastern petal which is of Sveta (white) colour,\nthen it has a mind (or is inclined) to Dharma with Bhakti (devotion). When it rests on the south-eastern\npetal, which is of Rakta (blood colour), then it is inclined to sleep and laziness. When it rests on the\nsouthern petal, which is of Krishna (black) colour, then it is inclined to hate and anger. When it rests on\nthe south-western petal which is of Nila (blue) colour, then it gets desire for sinful or harmful actions.\nWhen it rests on the western petal which is of crystal colour, then it is inclined to flirt and amuse. When\nit rests on the north-western petal which is of ruby colour, then it has a mind to walk, rove and have\nVairagya (or be indifferent). When it rests on the northern petal which is Pita (yellow) colour, then it is\ninclined to be happy and to be loving. When it rests on the north-eastern petal which is of Vaidurya\n(Lapis Lazuli) colour, then it is inclined to amassing money, charity and passion. When it stays in the\ninter-space between any two petals, then it gets the wrath arising from diseases generated through (the\ndisturbance of the equilibrium of) Vayu, bile and phlegm (in the body). When it stays in the middle,\nthen it knows everything, sings, dances, speaks and is blissful. When the eye is pained (after a day\u2019s\nwork), then in order to remove (its) pain, it makes first a circular line and sinks in the middle. The first\nline is of the colour of Bandhuka flower (Bassia). Then is the state of sleep. In the middle of the state of\nsleep is the state of dream. In the middle of the state of dream, it experiences the ideas of perception,\nVedas, inference, possibility, (sacred) words, etc. Then there arises much fatigue. In order to remove\nthis fatigue, it circles the second line and sinks in the middle. The second is of the colour of (the insect)\nIndragopa (of red or white colour). Then comes the state of dreamless sleep.\nDuring the dreamless sleep, it has only the thought connected with Parameshvara (the highest Lord)\nalone. This state is of the nature of eternal wisdom. Afterwards it attains the nature of the highest Lord\n(Parameshvara). Then it makes a round of the third circle and sinks in the middle. The third circle is of\nthe colour of Padmaraga (ruby). Then comes the state of Turya (the fourth). In Turya, there is only the\nconnection of Paramatman. It attains the nature of eternal wisdom. Then one should gradually attain the\nquiescence of Buddhi with self-control. Placing the Manas in Atman, one should think of nothing else.\nThen causing the union of Prana and Apana, he concentrates his aim upon the whole universe being of\nthe nature of Atman. Then comes the state of Turiyatita (viz., that state beyond the fourth). Then\neverything appears as bliss. He is beyond the pairs (of happiness and pains, etc.,). He stays here as long\nas he should wear his body. Then he attains the nature of Paramatman and attains emancipation through\nthis means. This alone is the means of knowing Atman.\nWhen Vayu (breath) which enters the great hole associated with a hall where four roads meet gets into\nthe half of the well-placed triangle, then is Achyuta (the indestructible) seen.\n95. Above the aforesaid triangle, one should meditate on the five Bija (seed) letters of (the elements)\nPrithvi, etc., as also on the five Pranas, the colour of the Bijas and their position. The letter \u2018Ya\u2019 is the\nBija of Prana and resembles the blue cloud. The letter \u2018Ra\u2019 is the Bija of Agni, is of Apana and\nresembles the sun.\n96. The letter \u2018La\u2019 is the Bija of Prithvi, is of Vyana and resembles Bandhuka flower. The letter \u2018Va\u2019 is\n\nthe Bija of Jiva (or Vayu), is of Udana and is of the colour of the conch.\n97-99(a). The letter \u2018Ha\u2019 is the Bija of Akasa, is of Samana and is of the colour of crystal. Prana stays\nin the heart, navel, nose, ear, foot, finger and other places, travels through the seventy-two thousand\nNadis, stays in the twenty-eight Crores of hair-pores and is yet the same everywhere. It is that which is\ncalled Jiva.\n99(b)-101(a). One should perform the three, expiration, etc., with a firm will and great control; and\ndrawing in everything (with the breath) in slow degrees, he should bind Prana and Apana in the cave of\nthe lotus of the heart and utter Pranava, having contracted his throat and the genital organ.\n101(b)-102. From the Muladhara (to the head) is the Susumna resembling the shining thread of the\nlotus. The Nada is located in the Vinadanda (spinal column); that sound from its middle resembles (that\nof) the conch, etc.\n103-104(a). When it goes to the hole of Akasa, it resembles that of the peacock. In the middle of the\ncave of the skull between the four doors shines Atman, like the sun in the sky.\n104(b)-105. Between the two bows in the Brahma-hole, one should see Purusha with Sakti as his own\nAtman. Then his Manas is absorbed there. That man attains Kaivalya who understands the gems,\nmoonlight, Nada, Bindu and the seat of Maheshvara (the great Lord).\nThus is the Upanishad.\nOm !

I shall now describe Yoga-Tattva (Yoga-Truth) for the benefit of Yogins who are freed from all sins\nthrough the hearing and the studying of it.\n2. The supreme Purusha called Vishnu, who is the great Yogin, the great being and the great Tapasvin,\nis seen as a lamp in the path of the truth.\n3. The Grandfather (Brahma) having saluted the Lord of the universe (Vishnu) and having paid Him\ndue respects, asked Him (thus): \u201cPray, explain to us the truth of Yoga which includes in it the eight\nsubservients.\u201d\n4. To which Hrisikesha (the Lord of the senses or Vishnu) replied thus: \u201cListen. I shall explain its truth.\nAll souls are immersed in happiness and sorrow through the snare of Maya.\n5-6. Kaivalya, the supreme seat, is the path which gives them emancipation, which rends asunder the\nsnare of Maya, which is the destroyer of birth, old age and disease and which enables one to overcome\ndeath. There are no other paths to salvation. Those who go round the net of Shastras are deluded by that\nknowledge.\n7. It is impossible even for the Devas to describe that indescribable state. How can that which is selfshining be illuminated by the Shastras ?\n8. That only which is without parts and stains and which is quiescent beyond all and free from decay\nbecomes the Jiva (self) on account of the results of past virtues and sins.\n9. How did that which is the seat of Paramatman, is eternal and above the state of all existing things\nand is of the form of wisdom and without stains attain the state of Jiva ?\n10. A bubble arose in it as in water and in this (bubble) arose Ahankara. To it arose a ball (of body)\n\nmade of the five (elements) and bound by Dhatus.\n11. Know that to be Jiva which is associated with happiness and misery and hence is the term Jiva\napplied to Paramatman which is pure.\n12-13. That Jiva is considered to be the Kevala (alone) which is freed from the stains of passion, anger,\nfear, delusion, greed, pride, lust, birth, death, miserliness, swoon, giddiness, hunger, thirst, ambition,\nshame, fright, heart-burning, grief and gladness.\n14. So I shall tell you the means of destroying (these) sins. How could Jnana capable of giving Moksha\narise certainly without Yoga ?\n15. And even Yoga becomes powerless in (securing) Moksha when it is devoid of Jnana. So the aspirant\nafter emancipation should practise (firmly) both Yoga and Jnana.\n16. The cycle of births and deaths comes only through Jnana and perishes only through Jnana. Jnana\nalone was originally. It should be known as the only means (of salvation).\n17-18(a). That is Jnana through which one cognises (in himself) the real nature of Kaivalya as the\nsupreme seat, the stainless, the partless and of the nature of Sachchidananda without birth, existence\nand death and without motion and Jnana.\n18(b)-19. Now I shall proceed to describe Yoga to you: Yoga is divided into many kinds on account of\nits actions: (viz.,) Mantra-Yoga, Laya-Yoga, Hatha-Yoga and Raja-Yoga.\n20. There are four states common to all these: (viz.,) Arambha, Ghata, Parichaya and Nishpatti.\n21. O Brahma, I shall describe these to you. Listen attentively. One should practise the Mantra along\nwith its Matrikas (proper intonations of the sounds) and others for a period of twelve years;\n22. Then he gradually obtains wisdom along with the Siddhis, (such as) Anima, etc. Persons of weak\nintellect who are the least qualified for Yoga practise this.\n23-24(a). The (second) Laya-Yoga tends towards the absorption of the Chitta and is described in\nmyriads of ways; (one of which is) \u2013 one should contemplate upon the Lord who is without parts (even)\nwhile walking, sitting, sleeping, or eating. This is called Laya-Yoga.\n24(b)-25. Now hear (the description of) Hatha-Yoga. This Yoga is said to possess (the following) eight\nsubservients, Yama (forbearance), Niyama (religious observance), Asana (posture), Pranayama\n(suppression of breath), Pratyahara (subjugation of the senses), Dharana (concentration), Dhyana, the\ncontemplation on Hari in the middle of the eyebrows and Samadhi that is the state of equality.\n26-27. Maha-Mudra, Maha-Bandha and Khechari, Jalandhara, Uddiyana and Mula-Bandha, uttering\nwithout intermission Pranava (OM) for a long time and hearing the exposition of the supreme truths,\nVajroli, Amaroli and Sahajoli, which form a triad \u2013 all these separately I shall give a true description of.\n28-29(a). O four-faced one (Brahma), among (the duties of) Yama moderate eating \u2013 and not others \u2013\nforms the principal factor; and non-injury is most important in Niyama.\n29(b). (The chief postures are) four (viz.,) Siddha, Padma, Simha and Bhadra.\n30-31. During the early stages of practice the following obstacles take place, O four-faced one, (viz.,)\nlaziness, idle talk, association with bad characters, acquisition of Mantras, etc., playing with metals\n(alchemy) and woman, etc., and mirage. A wise man having found out these should abandon them by\nthe force of his virtues.\n32. Then assuming Padma posture, he should practise Pranayama. He should erect a beautiful\nmonastery with a very small opening and with no crevices.\n33. It should be well pasted with cow-dung or with white cement. It should be carefully freed from\nbugs, mosquitoes and lice.\n34. It should be swept well every day with a broom. It should be perfumed with good odours; and\nfragrant resins should burn in it.\n35-36(a). Having taken his seat neither too high nor too low on a cloth, deer-skin and Kusa grass\nspread, one over the other, the wise man should assume the Padma posture and keeping his body erect\nand his hands folded in respect, should salute his tutelary deity.\n36(b)-40. Then closing the right nostril with his right thumb, he should gradually draw in the air\n\nthrough the left nostril. Having restrained it as long as possible, he should again expel it through the\nright nostril slowly and not very fast. Then filling the stomach through the right nostril, he should retain\nit as long as he can and then expel it through the left nostril. Drawing the air through that nostril by\nwhich he expels, he should continue this in uninterrupted succession. The time taken in making a round\nof the knee with the palm of the hand, neither very slowly nor vary rapidly and snapping the fingers\nonce is called a Matra.\n41-44. Drawing the air through the left nostril for about sixteen Matras and having retained it (within)\nfor about sixty-four Matras, one should expel it again through the right nostril for about thirty-two\nMatras. Again fill the right nostril as before (and continue the rest). Practise cessation of breath four\ntimes daily (viz.,) at sunrise, noon, sunset and midnight, till eighty (times are reached). By a continual\npractice for about three months, the purification of the Nadis takes place. When the Nadis have become\npurified, certain external signs appear on the body of the Yogin.\n45-46(a). I shall proceed to describe them. (They are) lightness of the body, brilliancy of complexion,\nincrease of the gastric fire, leanness of the body and along with these, absence of restlessness in the\nbody.\n46(b)-49. The proficient in Yoga should abandon the food detrimental to the practice of Yoga. He\nshould give up salt, mustard; things sour, hot, pungent, or bitter vegetables; asafoetida, etc., worship of\nfire, women, walking, bathing at sunrise, emaciation of the body by fasts, etc. During the early stages\nof practice, food of milk and ghee is ordained; also food consisting of wheat, green pulse and red rice\nare said to favour the progress. Then he will be able to retain his breath as long as he likes.\n50-53. By thus retaining the breath as long as he likes, Kevala Kumbhaka (cessation of breath without\ninspiration and expiration) is attained. When Kevala Kumbhaka is attained by one and thus expiration\nand inspiration are dispensed with, there is nothing unattainable in the three worlds to him. In the\ncommencement (of his practice), sweat is given out; he should wipe it off. Even after that, owing to the\nretaining of the breath, the person practising it gets phlegm. Then by an increased practice of Dharana,\nsweat arises.\n54. As a frog moves by leaps, so the Yogin sitting in the Padma posture moves on the earth. With a\n(further) increased practice, he is able to rise from the ground.\n55. He, while seated in Padma posture, levitates. There arises to him the power to perform\nextraordinary feats.\n56. He does (or should) not disclose to others his feats of great powers (in the path). Any pain small or\ngreat, does not affect the Yogin.\n57. Then excretions and sleep are diminished; tears, rheum in the eye, salivary flow, sweat and bad\nsmell in the mouth do not arise in him.\n58-60. With a still further practice, he acquires great strength by which he attains Bhuchara Siddhi,\nwhich enables him to bring under his control all the creatures that tread this earth; tigers, Sarabhas (an\nanimal with eight legs), elephants, with bulls or lions die on being struck by the palm of the Yogin. He\nbecomes as beautiful as the god of love himself.\n61-62. All females being taken up with the beauty of his person will desire to have intercourse with\nhim. If he so keeps connection, his virility will be lost; so abandoning all copulation with women, he\nshould continue his practice with great assiduity. By the preservation of the semen, a good odour\npervades the body of the Yogin.\n63. Then sitting in a secluded place, he should repeat Pranava (OM) with three Pluta-Matras (or\nprolonged intonation) for the destruction of his former sins.\n64. The Mantra, Pranava (OM) destroys all obstacles and all sins. By practising thus he attains the\nArambha (beginning or first) state.\n65-66. Then follows the Ghata (second State) \u2013 one which is acquired by constantly practising\nsuppression of breath. When a perfect union takes place between Prana and Apana, Manas and Buddhi,\nor Jivatma and Paramatman without opposition, it is called the Ghata state. I shall describe its signs.\n\n67. He may now practise only for about one-fourth of the period prescribed for practice before. By day\nand evening, let him practise only for a Yama (3 hours).\n68-69(a). Let him practise Kevala Kumbhaka once a day. Drawing away completely the organs from\nthe objects of sense during cessation of breath is called Pratyahara.\n69(b). Whatever he sees with his eyes, let him consider as Atman.\n70. Whatever he hears with his ears, let him consider as Atman. Whatever he smells with his nose, let\nhim consider as Atman.\n71. Whatever he tastes with his tongue, let him consider as Atman. Whatever the Yogin touches with\nhis skin, let him consider as Atman.\n72. The Yogin should thus unwearied gratify his organs of sense for a period of one Yama every day\nwith great effort.\n73-74. Then various wonderful powers are attained by the Yogin, such as clairvoyance, clair-audience,\nability to transport himself to great distances within a moment, great power of speech, ability to take\nany form, ability to become invisible and the transmutation of iron into gold when the former is\nsmeared over with his excretion.\n75-76. That Yogin who is constantly practising Yoga attains the power to levitate. Then should the wise\nYogin think that these powers are great obstacles to the attainment of Yoga and so he should never take\ndelight in them. The king of Yogins should not exercise his powers before any person whatsoever.\n77. He should live in the world as a fool, an idiot, or a deaf man, in order to keep his powers concealed.\n78-79. His disciples would, without doubt, request him to show his powers for the gratification of their\nown desires. One who is actively engaged in one\u2019s duties forgets to practise (Yoga); so he should\npractise day and night Yoga without forgetting the words of the Guru. Thus passes the Ghata state to\none who is constantly engaged in Yoga practice.\n80. To one nothing is gained by useless company, since thereby he does not practise Yoga. So one\nshould with great effort practise Yoga.\n81-83(a). Then by this constant practice is gained the Parichaya state (the third state). Vayu (or breath)\nthrough arduous practice pierces along with Agni the Kundalini through thought and enters the\nSusumna uninterrupted. When one\u2019s Chitta enters Susumna along with Prana, it reaches the high seat\n(of the head probably) along with Prana.\n83(b). There are the five elements: Prithvi, Apas, Agni, Vayu and Akasa.\n84-87(a). To the body of the five elements, there is the fivefold Dharana. From the feet to the knees is\nsaid to be the region of Prithvi, is four-sided in shape, is yellow in colour and has the Varna (or letter)\n\u2018La\u2019. Carrying the breath with the letter \u2018La\u2019 along the region of earth (viz., from the foot to the knees)\nand contemplating upon Brahma with four faces and four mouths and of a golden colour, one should\nperform Dharana there for a period of two hours. He then attains mastery over the earth. Death does not\ntrouble him, since he has obtained mastery over the earth element.\n87(b)-90. The region of Apas is said to extend from the knees to the anus. Apas is semi-lunar in shape\nand white in colour and has \u2018Va\u2019 for its Bija (seed) letter. Carrying up the breath with the letter \u2018Va\u2019\nalong the regions of Apas, he should contemplate on the God Narayana having four arms and a\ncrowned head, as being of the colour of pure crystal, as dressed in orange clothes and as decayless; and\npractising Dharana there for a period of two hours, he is freed from all sins. Then there is no fear for\nhim from water and he does not meet his death in water.\n91. From the anus to the heart is said to be the region of Agni. Agni is triangular in shape, of red colour\nand has the letter \u2018Ra\u2019 for its (Bija) seed.\n92-93(a). Raising the breath made resplendent through the letter \u2018Ra\u2019 along the region of fire, he should\ncontemplate on Rudra, who has three eyes, who grants all wishes, who is of the colour of the midday\nsun, who is daubed all over with holy ashes and who is of a pleased countenance.\n93(b)-94(a). Practising Dharana there for a period of two hours, he is not burnt by fire even though his\nbody enters the fire-pit.\n\n94(b)-96. From the heart to the middle of the eyebrows is said to the region of Vayu. Vayu is\nhexangular in shape, black in colour and shines with the letter 'Ya\u2019. Carrying the breath along the\nregion of Vayu, he should contemplate on Ishvara, the Omniscient, as possessing faces on all sides; and\npractising Dharana there for two hours, he enters Vayu and then Akasa.\n97-98(a). The Yogin does not meet his death through the fear of Vayu. From the centre of the eyebrows\nto the top of the head is said to be the region of Akasa, is circular in the shape, smoky in colour and\nshining with letter \u2018Ha\u2019.\n98(b)-101(a). Raising the breath along the region of Akasa, he should contemplate on Sadashiva in the\nfollowing manner, as producing happiness, as of the shape of Bindu, as the great Deva, as having the\nshape of Akasa, as shining like pure crystal, as wearing the rising crescent of moon on his head, as\nhaving five faces, ten hands and three eyes, as being of a pleased countenance, as armed with all\nweapons, as adorned with all ornaments, as having Uma (the goddess) in one-half of his body, as ready\nto grant favours and as the cause of all the causes.\n101(b). By practising Dharana in the region of Akasa, he obtains certainly the power of levitating in the\nAkasa (ether).\n102. Wherever he stays, he enjoys supreme bliss. The proficient in Yoga should practise these five\nDharanas.\n103. Then his body becomes strong and he does not know death. That great-minded man does not die\neven during the deluge of Brahma.\n104-105. Then he should practise Dharana for a period of six Ghatikas (2 hours, 24 minutes).\nRestraining the breath in (the region of) Akasa and contemplating on the deity who grants his wishes \u2013\nthis is said to be Saguna Dhyana capable of giving (the Siddhis) Anima, etc. One who is engaged in\nNirguna Dhyana attains the stage of Samadhi.\n106. Within twelve days at least, he attains the stage of Samadhi. Restraining his breath, the wise one\nbecomes an emancipated person.\n107. Samadhi is that state in which the Jivatman (lower self) and the Paramatman (higher Self) are\ndifferenceless (or of equal state). If he desires to lay aside his body, he can do so.\n108-109(a). He will become absorbed in Parabrahman and does not require Utkranti (going out or up).\nBut if he does not so desire and if his body is dear to him, he lives in all the worlds possessing the\nSiddhis of Anima, etc.\n109(b)-110. Sometimes he becomes a Deva and lives honoured in Svarga; or he becomes a man or an\nYaksha through his will. He can also take the form of a lion, tiger, elephant, or horse through his own\nwill.\n111. The Yogin becoming the great Lord can live as long as he likes. There is difference only in the\nmodes of procedure but the result is the same.\n112-115(a). Place the left heel pressed on the Anus, stretch the right leg and hold it firmly with both\nhands. Place the head on the breast and inhale the air slowly. Restrain the breath as long as you can and\nthen slowly breathe out. After practising it with the left foot, practise it with the right. Place the foot\nthat was stretched before on the thigh. This is Maha-Bandha and should be practised on both sides.\n115(b)-117(a). The Yogin sitting in Maha-Bandha and having inhaled the air with intent mind, should\nstop the course of Vayu (inside) by means of the throat Mudra and occupying the two sides (of the\nthroat) with speed. This is called Mahavedha and is frequently practised by the Siddhas.\n117(b)-118(a). With the tongue thrust into the interior cavity of the head (or throat) and with the eyes\nintent on the spot between the eyebrows, this is called Khechari-Mudra.\n118(b)-119(a). Contracting the muscles of the neck and placing the head with a firm will on the breast,\nthis is called the Jalandhara (Bandha); and is a lion to the elephant of death.\n119(b)-120(a). That Bandha by which Prana flies through Susumna is called Uddiyana Bandha by the\nYogins.\n120(b)-121(a). Pressing the heal firmly against the anus, contracting the anus and drawing up the\n\nApana, this is said to be Yoni-Bandha.\n121(b)-122(a). Through Mula-Bandha, Prana and Apana as well as nada and Bindu are united and gives\nsuccess in Yoga; there is no doubt about this.\n122(b)-124(a). The one practising in a reversed manner (or on both sides) which destroys all diseases,\nthe gastric fire is increased. Therefore a practitioner should collect a large quantity of provisions, (for)\nif he takes a small quantity of food, the fire (within) will consume his body in a moment.\n124(b)-125. On the first day, he should stand on his head with the feet raised up for a moment. He\nshould increase this period gradually every day. Wrinkles and greyness of hair will disappear within\nthree months.\n126. He who practises only for a period of a Yama (twenty-four minutes) every day conquers time. He\nwho practises Vajroli becomes a Yogin and the repository of all Siddhis.\n127-128. If the Yoga Siddhis are ever to be attained, he only has them within his reach. He knows the\npast and the future and certainly moves in the air. He who drinks of the nectar thus is rendered\nimmortal day by day. He should daily practise Vajroli. Then it is called Amaroli.\n129-131(a). Then he obtains the Raja-Yoga and certainly he does not meet with obstacles. When a\nYogin fulfils his action by Raja-Yoga, then he certainly obtains discrimination and indifference to\nobjects. Vishnu, the great Yogin, the grand one of great austerities and the most excellent Purusha is\nseen as a lamp in the path of truth.\n131(b)-134(a). That breast from which one suckled before (in his previous birth) he now presses (in\nlove) and obtains pleasure. He enjoys the same genital organ from which he was born before. She who\nwas once his mother will now be wife and she who is now wife is (or will be) verily mother. He who is\nnow father will be again son and he who is now son will be again father. Thus are the egos of this\nworld wandering in the womb of birth and death like a bucket in the wheel of a well and enjoying the\nworlds.\n134(b)-136(a). There are the three worlds, three Vedas, three Sandhyas (morning, noon and evening),\nthree Svaras (sounds), three Agnis and Gunas, and all these are placed in the three letters (OM). He\nwho understands that which is indestructible and is the meaning of the three (OM) \u2013 by him are all\nthese worlds strung. This is the Truth, the supreme seat.\n136(b)-138(a). As the smell in the flower, as the ghee in the milk, as the oil in the gingelly seed and as\nthe gold in the quartz, so is the lotus situated in the heart. Its face is downwards and its stem upwards.\nIts Bindu is downwards and in its centre is situated Manas.\n138(b)-139(a). By the letter \u2018A\u2019, the lotus becomes expanded; by the letter \u2018U\u2019, it becomes split (or\nopened). By the letter \u2018M\u2019, it obtains Nada; and the Ardha-Matra (half-metre) is silence.\n139(b)-140(a). The person engaged in Yoga obtains the supreme seat, which is like a pure crystal,\nwhich is without parts and which destroys all sins.\n140(b)-141. As a tortoise draws its hands and head within itself, so drawing in air thus and expelling it\nthrough the nine holes of the body, he breathes upwards and forwards.\n142. Like a lamp in an air-tight jar which is motionless, so that which is seen motionless through the\nprocess of Yoga in the heart and which is free from turmoil, after having been drawn from the nine\nholes, is said to be Atman alone.\u201d\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm !

The innermost Brahman is A, U, M \u2013 saying this a Yogi becomes free from the cycle of birth. Om,\nI bow to Narayana, having Sankha, Chakra and Gada. The upasaka will go to Vaikuntha.\nI-2-4. The Brahmapura is a lotus, shining like lightning and lamp. The son of Devaki is Brahmanya (a\nBrahmana with 44 sacraments); so are Madhusudana, Pundarikaksha, Vishnu and Achyuta.

The Maya has gone away from me, I am the pure vision; my ego has gone down, so has the\ndifference between world, god and soul. I am the inner-self, without positive and negative rules; I am\nthe expansive Bliss; I am the witness, independent, exerting in my greatness; without old age and\ndecay, opposing sides, pure knowledge, the ocean of liberation; I am subtle without any attributes.\nI am without three qualities, all worlds exists in my belly; the changeless consciousness, beyond reason\nand action, I have no parts, unborn, pure reality.\nI am endless knowledge, auspicious, indivisible, faultless, reality unbounded. I am to be known by\nAgamas, attractive to all the worlds. I am pure joy; purity, sole, ever shining, beginningless; I have\nascertained the highest Truth.\nI know myself without a second, with discrimination. Even then Bondage and Liberation are\nexperienced. The world has gone away that appears to be real like serpent and rope; only Brahman\nexists as the basis of the world; therefore the world does not exist; like sugar pervaded by the taste of\nthe sugarcane, I am pervaded by Bliss. All the three worlds, from Brahma to the smallest worm are\nimagined in me.\nIn the ocean there are many things, from the bubble to the wave; but the ocean does not desire these \u2013\nSo also, I have no desire for things of the world; I am like a rich-man not desiring poverty. A wise\nperson abandons poison favouring Amrita. The sun which makes the pot shine is not destroyed along\nwith the pot; so also the spirit is not destroyed with the body.\nI have no bondage nor liberation, no Shastra, no Guru. I have gone beyond Maya \u2013 let life go away or\nlet the mind be attacked \u2013 I have no misery as I am filled with joy, I know myself; Ignorance has run\naway somewhere \u2013 I have no doership nor duty, kula and gotra. These belong to the gross body, not to\nme different from it. Hunger, thirst, blindness, etc., belong to the Linga-deha only. Dullness, desire etc.,\nbelong only to the Karana-deha.\nJust as to an owl the sun is dark, so also for an ignorant person there is darkness in Brahman . When\nvision is blocked by clouds he thinks there is no sun. Just as Amrita, different from poison is not\naffected by its defects, I do not touch the defects of Inertia. Even a small lamp can remove big\ndarkness; so even a little knowledge destroys big ignorance.\nJust as there is no serpent in the rope at any time, there is no world in me.\nEven practising this for a muhurta (a short time) one does not return (to this world).\nOm!

Now once Narada, a jewel among ascetics, taking his (usual) rounds over all the (three) worlds,\nsanctifying (all the more) new sacred places and holy places of pilgrimage by his observation, (himself)\nattaining purity of mind, (remaining) free from enmity, tranquil, self-controlled, getting despondent\nfrom every quarter (seeing people\u2019s misery), closely investigating into his own Self, seeing the holy\nplace, the Naimisha (sacred) forest, noted for its joy of self-imposed religious observances and crowded\nwith saintly personages, he alighted there (from his aerial journey), fascinating groups of men, animals,\nhorse-faced demigods, gods, Kimnara demigods and nymphs with his songs on the exploits of Lord\nVishnu, called Sthavara and Jangama, which specially induce devotion to the Lord, set in musical notes\nsa, ri, ga, ma, pa, dha and ni, which arouse dispassion (to worldly attachments) and which are averse to\nthe ways of the world. On his approach, Saunaka and other great sages who had arrived there to\nparticipate in a sacrifice lasting twelve years, rich in Vedic lore, all wise (in sacerdotal functions), well\naddicted to stable penance and endowed with wisdom and dispassion, rose to greet him; and paying\nhomage, seated him (in a place of honour), after offering him a befitting welcome.\nThen, though they were (already) well instructed (in matters spiritual, yet for the benefit of the world)\nthey (said to Narada): \u2018Revered Sir, son of the god Brahma, what is the means of liberation (from\nworldly bondage) ? Please tell us.\u2019\n\nI-2. Thus requested, that (sage) Narada said to them: \u2018A (twice-born) of good family, invested with the\nsacred thread and initiated into Vedic study, having undergone the forty sacred rites (beginning with\nconsummation of marriage of his parents and ending with Aptoryama sacrifice), completing the course\non all branches of learning as a disciplined celibate student for twelve years, doing personal service to\nthe preceptor all along; the period of twenty-five years as a householder; (another) twenty-five years in\nthe stage of a forest dweller (Vanaprastha), all (the three stages) in due order in the prescribed manner;\nhaving studied well the duties of four kinds of Brahmacharya, six kinds of householders, four kinds of\nVanaprastha; having completed all the appropriate duties pertaining to them; equipped with the four\ndisciplines (for the study of Brahmavidya); free from desire in thought, word and deed as well as in\nlatent desires (vasanas) and solicitations (eshana), devoid of enmity and is peaceful and self-controlled;\nwhen such an ascetic, meditating on his Self without interruption in the highest stage of renunciation\n(as Paramahamsa), gives up the body, he becomes liberated (from rebirth), he becomes liberated. Thus\n(ends the first Upadesha of) the Upanishad.\nII-1. Then all (sages) Saunaka and others, requested the venerable Narada: \u2018Revered Sir, expound to us\nthe mode of renunciation\u2019. Observing them Narada said: \u2018It is but proper to know all about its nature\nfrom the mouth of the grandfather (the god Brahma)\u2019. After the completion of the sacrifice he went,\naccompanied by them, to the world of the god Brahma (Satyaloka) and made obeisance in the\nprescribed manner to him (Paramesthin) and eulogised him. Bidden by him he seated himself along\nwith them properly and said to the grandfather (of all): \u2018You are the preceptor, you are the Father, you\nare omniscient, knowing the secret of all lores. Hence be pleased to expound one secret (lore) of my\nchoice. Barring you, who is competent to speak on the secret (lore) dear to me ? It is to wit the stages in\nthe order of mendicant monks. Please tell us\u2019. Requested thus by Narada the god Brahma seeing them\nall on all sides, remained steady in deep meditation (Samadhi) for a short time. Coming to the\nconclusion that they were in search of a remedy against the ills of worldly life and turning to Narada\nthe grandfather said: \u2018My son, I shall now clearly expound the secret which was formerly taught by the\nsupreme Being (Viratpurusha) assuming the matchless form of the Purusha-sukta hymn and the secret\ndoctrine of the Upanishads. May you listen to this due order (of asceticism), very secret, with all your\nattention\u2019.\nII.2. \u2018O Narada, one born in a good family, being uninitiated at first, getting initiated into Vedic lore\n(after being invested with sacred thread), obedient to his mother and father, approaches (after the\npreliminary instructions by his father) a good preceptor, who maintains the noble tradition, has faith (in\nthe Vedic lore), is born of a good family, is well versed in the Vedas, has love for the Shastras, is\nvirtuous and free from devious ways. Bowing to him and rendering personal service appropriate for the\noccasion, he shall inform him of his heart\u2019s desire (to study under him). Having undergone the course\nof study in all branches of learning for twelve years, doing personal service all the while, he shall marry\nan agreeable damsel worthy of his family with his (preceptor\u2019s) consent. After this residence in the\npreceptor\u2019s house he leads, with the approval of the teacher, the life appropriate to a householder for\ntwenty-five years. Free from the evils of a bad Brahmana, getting a son with desire to perpetuate his\nfamily and completing twenty-five years befitting the stage of a householder, he shall lead the life of a\nlone forest-dweller (Vanaprastha) till (another) twenty five years are passed; bathing thrice a day after\ntouching with water the various parts of the body, eating one meal a day at the fourth watch (of day\ntime, i.e., in the afternoon), giving up journey to town and village as practised in former days,\nperforming appropriate rituals without using cultivated grains (such as wheat and rice, but using wild\ngrains alone), free from desire for enjoyments that are seen or heard of (i.e. pleasures in this world and\nthe next), being purified by the forty sacraments, free of attachments to all things, getting purity of\nmind, having burnt away envy, jealousy and egotism and being rich in the fourfold discipline \u2013 such a\nperson deserves to embrace (the life of) renunciation\u2019. Thus (ends the second Upadesha of) the\nUpanishad.\n\nIII-1. Then Narada asked the grandfather (Brahma): \u2018Lord, what is renunciation (Sannyasa) and who is\nentitled to renounce worldly life ?\u2019 \u2018I shall first deal with the (kind of) person entitled to renunciation\nand thereafter the mode of renunciation. Listen attentively:\n\u2018These (the following persons) do not deserve to renounce worldly life. A eunuch, one fallen (from\nright conduct), deformed person, women, the deaf, a child, the dumb, the heretic, an emperor, a\nreligious student, a Vaikhanasa anchorite and a Haradvija (Kapalika?), a hired teacher, a man without\nprepuce and one who does not maintain the sacred fire, even though all these are possessed of\ndispassion. Even if they adopt (the life of) renunciation they have no right to receive (instruction in) the\ngreat Vedic texts ('Thou art That' etc.,). One who is already an ascetic has the right to become the\nhighest kind of ascetic (Paramahamsa).\nIII-2. \u2018He who brings about protection from fear to others from him, as he gets himself (that protection\nfrom fear) from others, is declared in law books as a mendicant monk.\nIII-3-4. \u2018A eunuch, deformed person, the blind, a boy, one guilty of crime, one fallen from right\nconduct, one (always) at the gate of another (seeking help), the Vaikhanasa anchorite and the Haradvija,\nan emperor, a religious student, a heretic, one without prepuce, one who does not maintain the sacred\nfire, one who has twice or thrice renounced worldly life (previously), and a hired teacher \u2013 these\npersons do not deserve to embrace renunciation, excepting the afflicted in emergency (just before\ndeath).\u2019\nIII-5. How is (renunciation at) the time of dire affliction approved by the esteemed (Aryas) ?\n\u2018The time just prior to the departure of the vital breath from the body is called the sorely afflicted\n(time) and not any other; this occasion of emergency leads to the path of liberation (by recourse to\nrenunciation with the prescribed praisamantras).\nIII-6. Even in renunciation by the sorely afflicted (atura-sannyasa), a wise man shall renounce the\nworld only in the prescribed manner by uttering the mantras laid down for it and having repeated the\nmantras.\nIII-7. Even in the kind (of renunciation adopted) by the greatly afflicted, there is nowhere any\ndifference in the Praisa (mantras). There is no mantra (uttered) without a religious activity; (and) a\nreligious activity has an eye on a mantra.\nIII-8. (An act) without a mantra is no religious act (i.e. it is different); hence one shall not give up the\nmantra. A religious act done without mantra is like oblation offered in ashes.\nIII-9. Renunciation by the sorely afflicted is declared to be by abridging the ritual prescribed therefor;\nhence in atura-sannyasa, there is the mode of repeating mantras (without ritual), O sage\u2019.\nIII-10. If an ahitagni-householder gets disillusioned with the world while away in another province, he\nshall complete the Prapatya sacrifice in (a reservoir of) waters and then renounce worldly life.\nIII-11. A wise man shall renounce the world after completing (the prerequisite recital of Praisa mantras)\neither mentally, or by repeating the mantras in the prescribed manner (during the Prajapatya sacrifice)\nor (offer oblation) in waters or by performing rituals in the manner prescribed in the Veda; otherwise he\nwill be heading to a fall (degradation).\nIII-12. When desirelessness arises in the mind towards all objects, then (authorities) sanction\nrenunciation (by such person); contrariwise he shall fall (from virtue).\nIII-13. A wise man, when disillusioned with the world, may become a mendicant monk; when a person\nhas attachments he shall reside in his house. That degraded Brahmana who turns ascetic when he has\nattachments indeed goes to hell.\nIII-14. That Brahmana, in the stage of a disciplined celibate student, may take to renunciation, without\ngetting married whose tongue, genitals, stomach and hands are well guarded (i.e. they are under perfect\ncontrol).\nIII-15. Seeing worldly life as completely devoid of substance and with a desire to realize the essence\n(of all), they renounce the world without getting married, being imbued with great dispassion.\nIII-16. (All non-spiritual) activity is characterised by the play of an active part in worldly affairs; true\n\nknowledge is the characteristic of renunciation. Hence placing in front (i.e. preferring) wisdom, an\nintelligent man will renounce the world.\nIII-17. When a person realizes that the supreme reality is the eternal Brahman (alone) he shall, taking\nup the single emblematic staff, give up the tuft of hair along with the sacred thread.\nIII-18. He who is attached to the supreme Self (Paramatman), is detached from things other than that\n(Paramatman); freed from all desires it behoves on his part to eat food given as alms.\nIII-19. When a person, who becomes very pleased when he is honoured and respectfully saluted,\nbecomes similarly (very pleased) when he is being beaten, then he is a (true) mendicant monk\n(subsisting on alms).\nIII-20. \u2018I am the indestructible non-dual Brahman alone, called Vasudeva (Lord Vishnu)\u2019 \u2013 he whose\nfirm attitude is thus (established) becomes a (true) mendicant monk.\nIII-21. He is in the stage (leading to) final beatitude in whom are found peace, quiescence, purity, truth,\ncontentment, straightforwardness, absence of any possession and false airs.\nIII-22. When a person has no evil propensity towards all beings in deed, thought and speech he\nbecomes a (true) mendicant monk.\nIII-23. Attentively discharging his duties characterised by the ten (virtues) and studying in the\nprescribed manner the Upanishads (Vedanta), a twice-born (dvija), having discharged the three debts,\nmay renounce worldly life.\nIII-24. The ten virtues characterising right conduct (dharma) are: Contentment, forgiveness, selfcontrol, non-stealing, purity, control of the senses, humility, (scriptural) learning, truth, and an even\ntemper.\nIII-25. He abides in the stage (leading to) final emancipation who remembers not (with longing) past\npleasures, as also those not yet experienced; nor does he exult in those that have arrived.\nIII-26. He who is always able to keep the inward faculties of senses within and the outward objects of\nsense outside (without any reaction) resides in the stage (leading to) final beatitude.\nIII-27. Just as, when the vital breath has departed, the body no longer experiences pleasure and pain, he\n(the sage) is such even when he is alive (lit. when he is united with the vital breath); then he stays in the\nstage (leading to) final emancipation (Kaivalya).\nIII-28. A pair of loin cloth, a patched garment (against the cold of winter), and a single emblematic staff\nconstitute the accoutrements of the highest class of ascetics (Paramahamsa); no more is allowed by\n(scriptural) law;\nIII-29. If he were to possess more accoutrements for comfort he will go to the dreadful hell (Raurava)\nand be (renunciation-)born in the species of animals.\nIII-30. He may wear outwardly a patched garment strung out of pieces of discarded but clean cloth after\ndyeing it with ochre.\nIII-31. Wearing a single garment or unclad, his vision on one alone (i.e. liberation) and without longing\n(for pleasures) (the Paramahamsa) shall always be on the move alone; in the rainy season (alone) he\nmay stay in one place.\nIII-32. Giving up his house-hold (kinsmen), children and wife, all branches of the Veda, sacrificial rites\nand the sacred thread, the ascetic shall journey alone (without attracting attention to him).\nIII-33. Abandoning faults such as passion; anger, pride, greed and delusion the mendicant monk shall\nremain free from \u2018mine-ness\u2019 (nirmamah).\nIII-34. Ridding himself of love and hatred, (viewing) equally on clod, stone and gold and desisting\nfrom injuring (all) beings, the ascetic shall remain free from all desires.\nIII-35. An ascetic will attain liberation when he is freed of pride and egotism, devoid of hurting and\nwickedness, and possessed of the virtues of self-knowledge.\nIII-36. By attachment to (the pleasures of) the senses one undoubtedly comes to harm; restraining them\nalone well one attains final beatitude.\nIII-37-38. Desires do not subside by giving scope for their enjoyment; like fire fed by oblation, they\n\nonly increase all the more. That person is to be known as one who has conquered his senses, who\nneither rejoices in nor dislikes (the objects) having heard, touched, eaten, seen or smelt them.\nIII-39. He reaps all the fruits promised by the Vedanta (Upanishads) whose speech and mind are ever\npure and always well guarded.\nIII-40. A Brahmana (in quest of liberation) should always recoil from honours as from poison; he\nshould always welcome disregard as (he would) nectar.\nIII-41. A person illused (forgetting it) sleeps soundly, wakes up in good humour and goes about (his\nwork) in the world happily; (but) the insulter comes to grief.\nIII-42. One should bear patiently with abusive language and never insult another; nor should he in this\nembodied state, create enmity with anyone.\nIII-43. One shall not return anger for anger; when abused he shall speak gently for the welfare (of all);\none should never speak an untrue word which feeds (worldly desires of) the seven gates (of the body).\nIII-44. Taking delight in the supreme light (manifested in the individual Self), remaining quiescent, free\nfrom desires and blessings, seeking (supreme) bliss, he (the ascetic) should move about (as a mendicant\nmonk) with the Self alone as his companion.\nIII-45-47. He becomes fit for immortality by subduing the senses, enervating (feelings of) love and\nhatred and by non-injury to living beings. (This body) pillared by bones, bound together by tendons,\nplastered with flesh and blood, covered by skin, foul smelling, filled with urine and faeces, subject to\nold age and affliction, an abode of diseases, liable to injury, full of passion, impermanent and the abode\nof the elements (i.e. the body) one may abandon (without regret).\nIII-48. If one were to take delight in the body which is a conglomerate of flesh, blood, pus, faeces,\nurine, tendons, marrow and bones, that fool will be (delighted) in hell as well.\nIII-49. The attitude \u2018I am the body\u2019 is (the same as) the path leading to the hell (called) Kalasutra, the\ntrap for Mahavichi hell and a series of forest(-hells) where the trees have leaves as sharp as swords.\nIII-50. Even if total ruin faces one, this (identifying the body with the Self) should be abandoned by\nevery effort; it should not be touched (accepted) by a nobly-born person just as a (low born) tribal\nwoman carrying dog\u2019s meat.\nIII-51. Abandoning (both) virtuous acts towards one\u2019s dear ones and evil deeds towards unfriendly\npeople, (a person) attains the eternal Brahman by the practice of deep meditation (Dhyana-yoga).\nIII-52. By this method, abandoning all attachments gradually, and freed from (the influence of) all the\npairs (of opposites, such as pleasure and pain) one gets established in Brahman alone.\nIII-53. (The ascetic) shall journey alone without any helper for attaining final beatitude; for, seeing the\nperfection of the one (Brahman) he neither abandons it nor is he abandoned (by it).\nIII-54. A skull (for an alms bowl), (shelter under) the shade of trees, ragged garments, solitude and\nequanimity in all (things) - such is the characteristic of the liberated.\nIII-55. Benign to all beings, calm, wearing three-fold (emblematic) staff, (carrying) a water-pot,\ndelighting in the one (Brahman) \u2013 having become a mendicant monk (thus) he may enter a village for\nalms.\nIII-56. The mendicant monk shall be alone as stated before; two together are declared to be a pair\n(having attachment to each other); three together are said to constitute a village (with their bickerings);\nmore than these (three) become a city (of bustle and confusion).\nIII-57. The city (of ascetics) should not be created, nor the village nor the pair; an ascetic doing\n(forming part of) these three falls off his rightful duty.\nIII-58. Due to their close association there will doubtless be talks on royal personages, etc., mutual luck\nin alms, and (also) affection, tale-bearing and rivalry among them.\nIII-59. He shall remain alone and without desires; he shall not converse with any one. He shall utter\n\u2018Narayana\u2019 alone as the reply always (to other\u2019s statements).\nIII-60. In solitude he shall contemplate on Brahman (whole heartedly) in thought, word and deed. He\nshall not by any means either welcome death or (rejoice in) life.\n\nIII-61. He shall only mark time (when practising asceticism) till the allotted span of life is completed;\nhe shall neither welcome death nor rejoice in living. He shall await the time (of death) alone as an\nemployee awaits orders.\nIII-62. A mendicant monk gets liberation when he possesses the following six characteristics: he is\ntongueless (in relishing food and speech), a eunuch (in sex), lame (in push), blind (in seeing sense\nobjects), deaf (in hearing praise or curse) and innocent (like a child). There is no doubt about it.\nIII-63. That ascetic is said to be tongueless who, while eating food is not conscious of its being savoury\nor otherwise and who speaks words beneficial and truthful in moderation.\nIII-64. He is a eunuch who is unaffected on seeing a female whether newly born, sixteen year old or\none of a hundred years.\nIII-65. When an ascetic goes about (only) for alms and answering calls of nature and does not exceed (a\ndistance of) thirteen or fourteen kilometres (in a day) he is by all means a lame person.\nIII-66. That mendicant monk is said to be blind whose eyes, (being modestly lowered) while standing\nstill or walking, do not see far excepting sixteen cubits of ground (before him).\nIII-67. Hearing words beneficial or otherwise, pleasing to the mind or causing grief, he seems not to\nhear them (i.e. remains equanimous); such a sage is said to be deaf.\nIII-68. That mendicant monk is said to be childlike who always remains as if asleep in the presence of\nobjects of sensory pleasures, (though) his senses are efficient and unimpaired.\nIII-69. Show by dancers, etc., gambling, lady friend (of former days), eatables (heaped temptingly),\n(other) enjoyable things and a woman in her courses \u2013 these an ascetic shall always avoid.\nIII-70. An ascetic shall never even think of in his mind these six \u2013 love, hatred, intoxication,\nbamboozling, hurting and deluding others.\nIII-71. A bedstead, white clothes, talk on women, unsteadiness, daytime sleep and a carriage \u2013 these six\ncause the fall of ascetics.\nIII-72. One who thinks on the Self shall painstakingly avoid long journeys. The ascetic shall always be\npractising the lore of the Upanishads which is the means for liberation.\nIII-73. The ascetic shall not always be resorting to a place of pilgrimage nor be undergoing fasts\nfrequently; he shall not be studying the scripture all the time nor be expounding them exclusively.\nIII-74. He shall always conduct himself without (committing) sin, deceit and devious acts, restraining\nhis senses in every way as a tortoise does its limbs.\nIII-75-76. He will be released (from worldly bondage) when the functioning of his senses and the mind\nhas become quiescent; is free of hopes (of gain) and possessions; is indifferent to the pairs (of\nopposites, pleasure and pain, etc.,), reverential salutation and the exercise of his will (nihsvadhakara);\nis free from \u2018mine-ness\u2019, egotism, expectations and blessings; and sticks to solitude. There is no doubt\nabout it. Thus (are the duties of ascetics).\nIII-77. A disciplined celibate student, a householder or a forest-dweller (Vanaprastha) may renounce\nworldly life when he is ever vigilant in leading a righteous life, possesses (proficiency in) action, has\ndevotion and wisdom, and comes to possess dispassion of his own accord. If he is chiefly interested (in\nthe particular stage of his life) he shall complete the stage of studentship and become a householder;\nfrom (the stage of a householder) becoming a forest-dweller, he shall (thereafter) renounce the world.\nOr otherwise he may renounce worldly life from the stage of a student or householder or forest dweller.\nBut then a person may renounce, that very day on which he gets disillusioned with the world, whether\nhe is one who observes not vows (before the stage of renunciation) or observes them, whether he has\nundergone the prescribed ablution on completing the disciplined studentship or not, whether he is one\nwho has discontinued maintaining the ritual fire at the death of his wife (utsannagni) or is one who does\nnot maintain (for other causes) the ritual fire (anagnika). Some (law-givers) prescribe the sacrifice\ncalled Prajapatya (of which god Brahma is the presiding deity, to a twice-born before he embraces\nrenunciation). But (though thus said) he may not do so. He shall only perform the Agneyi sacrifice\n(whose presiding deity is Agni, the god of fire). For Agni is the vital breath (Prana). Thereby he does\n\n(strengthen) the vital breath. (Then) he shall perform the Traidhataviya sacrifice (whose presiding deity\nis the god Indra). By this (sacrifice) the three vital fluids (become strong like fire), namely the Sattva\n(semen), rajas (blood) and Tamas (the dark one).\nIII-78. (Having performed the sacrifice in the prescribed manner he shall smell the holy fire, reciting\nthe following mantra): \u2018Oh Fire, this (vital breath) is your source; as you are born at the proper time (of\nthe year) you put on effulgence. Knowing him (the Atman, your ultimate source) may you merge (with\nthe Prana, your source). May you increase our wealth (of transcendent knowledge)\u2019. Thus reciting the\nmantra he shall smell the fire. This is the source of fire, this vital air. May you go unto Prana, may you\ngo unto your source. Svaha. Thus alone this (mantra) says. Having secured the ritual fire from the\nAhavaniya (sacred fire) he shall smell it as before. If he is unable to procure the ritual fire he shall offer\nthe oblation in the waters. For water is (presided over by) all the gods. Reciting (the mantra) \u2018I offer the\noblation to all the gods, Svaha, he shall tender the oblation, and picking up (a small portion left over of)\nthe offered oblation which is mixed with ghee, he shall eat it (mixed) with water. The oblation mixed\nwith ghee is beneficial and gives (leads to) liberation. Thus (it has been declared). Only after discarding\nthe tuft of hair, sacred thread, parents, son, wife, (normal) work, study, mantras (other than those\nprescribed for ascetics), a wise man (knower of spiritual knowledge) renounces worldly life. By the\nmantras of liberation pertaining to the Traidhataviya sacrifice he shall attain (final beatitude). That is\nBrahman; that should reverently be resorted to. Thus alone is this (liberation attained). Thus.\nIII-79. Narada again asked of the grandfather (Brahma): \u2018How is he, (being now) without the sacred\nthread, a Brahmana ?\u2019 The god Brahma said to him (as follows).\nIII-80. Taking a shave with the (removal of the) tuft, a wise man shall discard the external (sacred)\nthread. He shall wear as the thread (i.e. he shall always be conscious of) the transcendent Brahman\nwhich is indestructible.\nIII-81. The sutra is so called as it indicates (Brahman). The sutra is indeed the supreme state. That\nBrahmana (alone) has completely mastered the Vedas who has realized that sutra.\nIII-82. The Yogin, the knower of yoga and the perceiver of the truth, shall possess that sutra (Brahman)\nby which everything is held together (sustained), as a group of gems by a thread.\nIII-83. Established in the highest yoga a wise man shall abandon the external (Sacred) thread. He is\nwise who possesses the sutra, the state of Brahman. Possessing that sutra he becomes neither unholy or\nimpure.\nIII-84. Those who have the sutra inwardly and possess the sacred thread of wisdom, are indeed the\nknowers of the sutra; they wear the (true) sacred thread.\nIII-85. Those who wear a tuft of hair in the form of wisdom (Jnana), whose fundamental condition is\nwisdom, who possess the sacred thread of wisdom, to whom wisdom alone is supreme, have, it is said,\npure knowledge.\nIII-86. That wise man whose tuft consists of wisdom, like the flame in the case of fire, and no other, is\nsaid to be the possessor of sikha (tuft; pre-eminence); not others who (merely) bear a lock of hair on the\ncrown of the head.\nIII-87. The Brahmana and such others who are engaged in Vedic rites are to wear this (sacred) thread;\nfor it is declared to be part of the ceremony.\nIII-88. He whose tuft consists of wisdom as also his sacred thread (of that wisdom), has all the\nrequisites of a Brahmana; so understand the knowers of the Veda. Thus.\nIII-89. Knowing thus (the duties of ascetics), a Brahmana, having renounced worldly life, becomes a\nmendicant monk, wearing a single garment and shaven-headed, he receives no gifts (other than simple\nfood for bare sustenance), if he is unable to bear bodily privation (of an unclad, unsoliciting Avadhuta\nascetic). Or, according to prescribed rules, becoming unclad (lit. possessing a form as when newly\nborn), renouncing his children, friends, wife, close kinsmen, etc., his Vedic study and rituals,\nabandoning the entire world, his loin cloth, emblematic staff and (warm) garment; being capable of\nputting up with the pairs (of opposites, pleasure and pain, etc.) and unmindful of cold and heat,\n\npleasure and pain, sleep, honour and dishonour, and the six human infirmities (hunger, etc.); leaving off\ncensuring, egotism, rivalry, pride, false airs, jealousy, envy, desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, love, anger,\ncovetousness, delusion, etc.; remembering his body as a corpse; not conscious of anything other than\nthe Self both inwardly and outwardly; not bowing to anyone, having neither the utterance of Svaha (in\nworshipping the gods) nor the utterance of Svadha (in honour of the manes); indulging neither in praise\nnor blame; he thus becomes independent of extraneous influences.\nContented with (food alone) that comes unsolicited, he shall not accept (gifts of) gold, etc. He does\nneither the invocation of deities nor utter mantras to send them back; he has not mantra or non-mantra,\nmeditation or worship, aim or non-aim, separation or union; and being of firm mind (in regard to\nresidence) has no home (to sleep in at night) other than a deserted house, the shade of a tree, a temple, a\nclump of (tall) grass, a potter\u2019s shed, a hut where ritual fire is kept, the Southeast quarter, the sandy\nbank of a river, a cellar, cave or grounds near water falls or in a forest. He may have no distinctive\nemblem of an ascetic (like the great sages of yore) such as Svetaketu, Ribhu, Nidagha, Rishabha,\nDurvasas, Samvartaka, Dattatreya and Raivataka. His conduct is incomprehensible (to ordinary people)\nlike the conduct of children, mad men and ghosts. Though (perfectly) sane he behaves like an insane\nperson. Muttering Svaha he shall discard all these in the waters \u2013 the threefold (emblematic) staff, sling\n(to carry his effects), (alms) bowl, (water) vessel, waist band and loin-cloth.\nIII-90. He shall journey (as a mendicant monk) unclad, leaving in the waters all these \u2013 the waistband,\nloin-cloth, the (emblematic) staff, garment and water vessel.\nIII-91. He shall seek the (realization of the) Self. Remaining unclad, free from (the influence of) the\npairs (of opposites), receiving no gifts, well established in the path of the reality of Brahman, with his\nmind pure, eating food to sustain life at the prescribed hour with his hand or otherwise (placed in the\nmouth) without begging, equanimous in gain or denial (of food), without \u2018mine-ness\u2019, deeply interested\nin meditating on the pure effulgence (i.e. Brahman), devoted to the supreme spirit (manifested as the\nindividual Self), deeply engaged in rooting out the effect of good and bad actions, he shall renounce\n(all other than the Self); having only one thought, namely of supreme bliss, ever recollecting Brahman\nin the form of Pranava (Om) and that he is Brahman alone, he shall give up the threefold body\naccording to the maxim of the wasp (to become one with Brahman) and abandon the body by\nrenunciation alone. He becomes one who has fulfilled himself (i.e. he attains liberation in the\ndisembodied state). Thus (ends the third Upadesha of) the Upanishad.\nIV-1. He who abandons the (three) worlds, the Vedas, objects of senses, the (influence of the) sense and\nremains (established) in the Atman alone, attains the highest goal.\nIV-2. A good ascetic shall never answer the inquiry on his name, lineage, etc., his native place, duration\n(of his stay there), study of the scripture, family, age, conduct, and the vows observed by him.\nIV-3. He shall neither converse with any woman nor remember one seen before; he shall avoid all talks\non them and never look at one even in a picture.\nIV-4. The mind of an ascetic will necessarily get disturbed on his doing the four things regarding\nwomen (mentioned above); due to this agitation of the mind he is lost.\nIV-5-6. An ascetic comes down (from his high position) if he has greed, anger, untruth, bamboozling,\ncovetousness, delusion, likes and dislikes, (love of) fine art, explaining tendency, desire, passion,\naccepting (gifts), egotism, \u2018mine-ness\u2019, practising medicine, enforcing right conduct (in others),\nexpiatory acts, journeying abroad (into unholy places), and (the practice of) mantras, herbs, poisons and\nblessing (others) which are prohibited.\nIV-7. A sage intent on liberation shall not speak (words such as) \u2018come, go, stop, welcome, friends and\nhonouring\u2019.\nIV-8. A mendicant monk shall neither accept gifts nor induce others to offer donation nor prompt\n(others to give or take gifts) at any time even in a dream.\nIV-9. Hearing or seeing good or bad of his (former) wife, brother, children, etc., and kinsmen, he shall\n\nnot get agitated; he shall give up sorrow and delusion.\nIV-10-12. Abstaining from injury, (having) truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, non-acquiring,\nhumility, absence of depression, serenity, stability, straight-forwardness, freedom from affection,\nserving respectable elders, faith, forgiveness, calmness, non-alignment, fortitude, amiability, endurance,\ncompassion, modesty, knowledge and wisdom, contemplation of the supreme Spirit (Yoga), very\nmoderate diet and contentment \u2013 these are well known as the essential requisites of self-controlled\nascetics.\nIV-13. Free from (the influence of) the pairs (of opposites), ever established in goodness, equanimous\nin everything, the sage in the fourth stage (of asceticism), the Paramahamsa, is the visible god\nNarayana.\nIV-14. Except in the rainy season, he may stay one night in a village and five nights in a city; during the\nrains he may stay four months (in a village or town).\nIV-15. The mendicant monk shall not stay two nights in a village; if he stays, affection, etc., may find\nscope (to deflect him); thereby he will go to hell.\nIV-16. In the outskirts of a village, in a secluded spot he may pitch his camp and go about (for alms)\nlike a worm (crawling) on the ground; during the rains he shall stay in one place.\nIV-17. Clad in a single garment or unclad, with his vision fixed in the one (Brahman), free from\ndesires, undeflected from the path of the good and deeply meditating he shall walk the earth.\nIV-18. Practising his essential duties in a pure place always a mendicant monk shall ever be on the\nmove, his eye fixed on the ground.\nIV-19. He shall never journey at night, midday or during the two twilights; neither in a deserted place\nnor an impassable region nor a place causing harm to creatures.\nIV-20. A mendicant monk may stay one night in a village, two nights in a small town, three nights in a\nbig town and five nights in a city. During the rains he may camp in one place which has plenty of pure\nwater.\nIV-21. Seeing all beings as like unto himself a mendicant monk shall walk the earth, like a person\nblind, dull-witted, deaf, mad and dumb.\nIV-22. A Bahudaka mendicant monk and a forest-dweller, it is declared, are to have a bath at the three\nperiods (junctures) of the day, the Hamsa ascetic but once a day and a Paramahamsa ascetic has none\n(prescribed).\nIV-23. The ascetic carrying a single emblematic staff shall observe these seven things - silence, Yoga\nposture, deep meditation, endurance, solitude, desirelessness and equanimity.\nIV-24. One at the stage of a Paramahamsa, due to the absence of prescribed rules in regard to bath, etc.,\nshall merely give up all the activities of the mind.\nIV-25. What difference is there between worms (revelling in putrid waters) and men who take delight\nin (the body consisting of) skin, flesh, blood, tendons, marrow, fat, bones, faeces, urine and pus ?\nIV-26. Where (on the one hand) is the body, a great conglomerate of all (foul things) such as phlegm\nand others and where (on the other hand) are merits such as bodily splendour, auspiciousness and\npersonal charm ?\nIV-27. If a fool takes delight in his body which is a conglomerate of flesh, blood, pus, faeces, urine,\ntendons, marrow and bones, he will be (delighted) in hell as well.\nIV-28. Though there is no difference between the unmentionable region of women and a purified ulcer,\npeople are generally deceived by the difference in outlook.\nIV-29. A piece of skin split in twain and perfumed by the Apana-wind \u2013 a bow to those who take\ndelight in it ! What is greater rashness than this ?\nIV-30-31. The wise ascetic has no (worldly) work to do nor has he any emblem. The sage free from\n\u2018mine-ness\u2019 and fear, calm, uninfluenced by the pairs (of opposites), taking food without castedistinction, clad in loin cloth or unclad, shall remain deeply engaged in meditation. Thus the Yogin,\nsolely devoted to wisdom is fit for identity with Brahman.\n\nIV-32. Even though he may carry an emblem (such as the staff), the (real) cause of his liberation is his\nspiritual knowledge alone. To the people here (in the matter of attaining final beatitude) an assemblage\nof emblems is meaningless.\nIV-33. He is a Brahmana (knower of Brahman) who knows not (the difference between) one who is\ngood or bad, unlearned or highly learned (in scripture), of good or bad character.\nIV-34. Therefore a wise (ascetic) shall move about unobtrusively without any emblem, knowing right\nconduct, devoted to the vow of (realizing) Brahman, and resorting to the secret doctrine (i.e. the\nUpanishads)).\nIV-35. He shall journey over the earth, a mystery to all people, devoid of class or stage of life, as\n(though he were) blind, dull-witted and dumb.\nIV-36. Seeing him calm in mind the gods desire to be like him. As he observes no distinction he attains\nthe (distinctionless) final beatitude. Thus the teaching of the god Brahma. Thus (it ends).\nIV-37. Then Narada asked of Brahma (the grandfather): \u2018Pray expound to us the method of\nrenunciation\u2019. The god Brahma agreeing to it saying \u2018Be it so\u2019 declared: For embracing the fourth stage\nof life (i.e. renunciation) whether one is in a state of emergency or in the regular sequence, one shall\nperform the eight commemorative religious ceremonies (astasraddha) after having first undergone the\npenance to expiate all sins (kricchraprayaschitta), the eight ceremonies being (the propitiation of) the\ngods, sages (of yore), (other) divine beings, men, (the five) primary elements, manes, father, mother\nand (one\u2019s) Self. First (he shall propitiate) the group of deities named Satya, Vasu, etc.; in the\ncommemorative ceremony for the gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshvara (Siva); in the Sraddha\nceremony for the sages, divine sages (like Narada), royal sages (like Janaka) and men-sages (like\nYajnavalkya); in the Sraddha for divine beings, the (eight) Vasus, the (eleven) Rudras and the (twelve)\nAdityas (suns); in the Sraddha for men, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumara and Sanatsujata (son of the\ngod Brahma); in the Sraddha for the Elements, the five primary elements Earth, etc., the sensory organs\nsuch as the eye, and the four groups of living beings; in the Sraddha for the manes, father, paternal\ngrandfather and paternal great grandfather; in the Sraddha for the female ancestors, mother, paternal\ngrandmother and paternal great grandmother; in the Sraddha for one\u2019s Self, one self, father and paternal\ngrandfather; if his father is alive, leaving off the father, himself, paternal grandfather and paternal great\ngrandfather.\nIn all cases he shall honour the Brahmanas, arranging that two of them are present each time. Having\nhonoured the Brahmanas in the manner prescribed for the ceremony of the daily offerings to deceased\nancestors (pitryajna) during the eight Sraddhas performed in eight days or in a day with the mantras\npertaining to his own branch of the Veda, following the option of a single ceremony a day or eight\nceremonies on the same day; having completed (the rituals) according to rules till they are fed; having\nperformed the offering of rice-balls to the manes and bidding farewell to the Brahmanas, pleased with\nthe presents and betel rolls; having saved seven hairs for the success of the remaining ritual acts; the\ntwice born, having had seven or eight hairs shaved together along with the (remaining) hairs and beard,\nand the nails cut for the success of the remaining ritual acts; bathing after the shave in which hairs in\nthe arm pits and the public hairs are exempted and preserving the (above said) seven hairs; completing\nthe evening twilight worship; muttering the Gayatri mantra a thousand times; performing the (daily)\nteaching and study of the Vedas; getting ready his own ritual fire; completing (the recital of) his branch\nof the Veda; offering the oblation of ghee in the fire as stated in it (his Vedic branch) till Agni and Soma\nhave been propitiated; completing the act of offering oblations; (ceremoniously) eating the barley meal\nthree times (invoking) himself, etc., keeping alive the fire after having ceremoniously sipped water\n(achamana); seating himself in a skin of the black antelope at the north of the fire, keeping awake\nlistening to the recital of Puranas; bathing at the end of the fourth watch (of the night), boiling the\noblation in that fire, offering the rice-oblation sixteen times reciting the Purusha-sukta; performing the\nViraja ritual (so as to be free from all sins); sipping water ceremoniously and gifting clothes, gold,\nvessel and cow along with a cash present, completing (the preceding rituals), bidding farewell to the\n\ngod Brahma who had been invoked, invoking the fire to be (symbolically) present on his person\n(reciting the mantras) \u2013\n\u2018May the Maruts bring together (the scattered vital energy), may Indra (do so), may Brihaspati (do so),\nmay this fire (do so granting) along with (long) life, wealth and strength; may he make me long lived\u2019.\nThus.\n\u2018Oh Agni, come with your body which is fit for sacrifice. (You) being my Self, may you climb into my\nbody, bringing before me great wealth suitable for men. Assuming the form of sacrifice, may you rest\nin my body, your source. Oh, Fire, being born of the earth, may you come with your abode; meditating\non Fire, bidding farewell to him after having circumambulated and prostrated in reverence before him;\nworshipping the morning twilight; paying obeisance to the Sun reciting the Gayatri mantra a thousand\ntimes, seated in the waters which reach up to his navel; bidding farewell to Gayatri having made\nrespectful offerings to the eight guardian-deities of the quarters; mingling the Gayatri with the Vyahritis\n(bhur, bhuvas, suvas) and reciting in a low, middling or high tone or mentally (the mantras), \u2018I am the\nstimulator of the tree (of the phenomenal world). Fame (of my knowledge) is lofty like the peak of a\nmountain. High and holy, I am the immortal being as (the immortal Self) in the sun. (I am) the wealth\n(of the Self) endowed with effulgence. Possessing true knowledge I am immersed in my immortal\nnature. Thus the words of self-realization (based on the Veda) of Trisanku (a realized soul)\u2019.\n\u2018He (the Om) who is the most exalted of the Vedas and omnipresent and who has sprung from the\nambrosial scripture \u2013 may that (Om), the (supreme) lord endow me with (true) intelligence. May I, Oh\nLord, become the possessor of (wisdom leading to) immortality; my body very active (in the higher\nlife); my tongue (speech) possessed of sweetness to the highest degree. May I with my ears, listen to\nthe wealth (of Vedantic learning). You are the sheath of Brahman, concealed by worldly intelligence\n(while please rent asunder). Pray protect my wisdom (born) of the study of the scripture\u2019; \u2018I am (now)\nrisen above the desire for wife, desire for wealth and desire for worldly glory\u2019. \u2018Om Bhuh, I have\nrenounced (the world)\u2019. \u2018Om Bhuvah, I have renounced\u2019. \u2018Om Suvah, I have renounced\u2019. Sipping water\n(ceremoniously, reciting the mantra) \u2018Freedom from fear to all beings; everything emanates from\nmemory, Svaha\u2019; offering (water) to the East with the palms fully folded and uprooting the sikha (of\nseven hairs) reciting Om Svaha; snapping the sacred thread (reciting the mantras) \u2013 \u2018The sacred thread\nis highly sanctifying; it has been natural to the god Brahma (Prajapati) in the first place; foremost in\npromoting long life, put on thus. May the bright (fresh) sacred thread be the strength and effulgence\n(unto me);\n\u2018Let not the sacred thread reside externally; may you, entering inside into the middle (of the heart) ever\ngrant (me) the highly sanctifying fame, strength, wisdom and dispassion, and (true) intelligence\u2019.\nOffering water with cupped palms, he shall offer (the sacred thread) as oblation to the waters, (reciting\nthe mantra) \u2018Om Bhuh, (pray) reach the sea, Svaha\u2019. Repeating thrice, \u2018Om Bhuh, I have renounced,\nOm Bhuvah, I have renounced, Om Suvah, I have renounced\u2019, he shall ceremoniously sip water and\ndiscard in the waters his garment and waist band, reciting \u2018Om Bhuh Svaha\u2019. Reminding himself that\nhe had ceased from all (worldly) activities and becoming unclad he shall start for the north with his\nhand raised and thinking of his Self.\nIV-38. If, as stated before, he is an enlightened recluse, he shall receive instruction from his Guru on\nthe Pranava (Om) and the great scriptural texts (such as 'Thou art That'), journeying (as a mendicant\nmonk) in easy stages, (convinced) that no one exists other than his Self and subsisting on fruits,\n(edible) leaves and water and thus move about on hills, forests and temples. Then unclad, giving up\njourneying all (over the earth), his heart solely filled with the experience of bliss always, profited by\nthe complete severance of (worldly) activities, sustaining life by means of fruits, juicy barks, leaves,\nbulbous roots and water only for attaining liberation, he shall discard his body in some mountain cave\nremembering the emancipating mantra (Om).\nIV-39. If he is a recluse desiring further study (Vividisha Sannyasin) he shall proceed along with\nlearned Brahmanas like his preceptor, etc., and receiving a staff, waistband, loin cloth, garment and\n\nwater vessel (offered) by his preceptors reciting, \u2018Pray wait, wait, blessed one, take the staff, (ochre)\ngarment and water vessel\u2019, he shall go to the spiritual guide\u2019s presence to receive instruction in the\nPranava (Om) and the great scriptural texts (Mahavakyas). He shall then receive the (emblematic)\nbamboo staff, which is free from cuts from the tip of the top, evenly shaped, smooth, free from black\ncolour and is auspicious looking, having first sipped water ceremoniously and (repeating the mantra),\n\u2018You are my friend. Protect my strength. You, my friend, are Indra\u2019s (weapon) Vajra, the destroyer of\n(the demon) Vritra. May you bring protection to me. Prevent that which is a sin\u2019. He shall then receive\nthe water-vessel reciting the Pranava first (and then the mantra) \u2018You are the life of the world, you are\nthe container of water, you who are always cool\u2019. (Receiving) the waist-band, loin cloth and the (ochre)\ngarment (reciting the mantra in the due order), \u2018the waist-band, the supporter of the loin cloth, Om; the\ncover for the privities, the loincloth, Om; the garment, which is the protection against cold, wind, and\nheat, Om;\u2019 and invested with the yoga cloth (cloth used for meditation) preceded by the ceremonial\nsipping of water, he shall zealously follow the rules of his stage of life (i.e. asceticism) considering that\nhe has fulfilled himself (in the quest for liberation). Thus (ends the fourth Upadesha of the Upanishad.\nV-1. Then Narada asked of the god Brahma: \u2018Lord, you have said that renunciation entails ceasing from\nall activity. Again you have said that one shall be zealous in the conduct of one\u2019s stage of life\u2019.\nThen the god Brahma replied: \u2018To the embodied being there are the four stages of waking, dreaming,\nsleeping and the fourth stage (Turiya). Under their influence people who engage themselves in action,\nknowledge and dispassion, conform to them in their conduct\u2019. \u2018If this is so, Lord, how many kinds of\nrenunciation are there ? What are the differences in their practice ? Pray expound to us completely\u2019.\nAgreeing to this saying \u2018Be it so\u2019 the god Brahma (said to) him (as follows).\nV-2. If the question is raised, \u2018How does conduct differ in the varieties of renunciation ? (the answer is)\nthat renunciation is really one only, that it becomes threefold due to imperfection of knowledge (vidvatsannyasa), incapacity (vividisha-sannyasa) and failure in action (atura-sannyasa) and it attains the four\nstages of renunciation due to dispassion, renunciation due to wisdom, renunciation due to wisdom and\ndispassion and renunciation of action.\nV-3. This is how it is. Due to the absence of wicked passion, by indifference to objects of pleasure and\nby the influence of good actions done before, one who renounces the world is (called) the renouncer\ndue to dispassion.\nV-4. Due to the knowledge of the scripture (shastras), withdrawing from the phenomenal world by\nlistening to sinful and auspicious experiences of the world; desisting from all the world composed of\nanger, jealousy, intolerance, egotism and pride; discarding bodily inclinations such as desire for wife,\ndesire for wealth and desire for worldly glory, (excessive) regard for the shastras and public esteem;\nconsidering all these common things to be eschewed as vomit; endowed with the four disciplines (such\nas discrimination or permanent and transitory things) \u2013 he who renounces thus alone is a renouncer due\nto wisdom.\nV-5. Having studied all (scripture) in due order and experienced all (worldly life) one who, influenced\nby wisdom cum dispassion and deep meditation on the Self, becomes an unclad (ascetic), is the\nrenouncer due to wisdom cum dispassion.\nV-6. Having completed the course of disciplined student-ship in celibacy, becoming a householder,\nreaching the stage of a forest-dweller, he who (thereafter) renounces the world in accordance with the\norder of the stages of life even in the absence of dispassion, is a renouncer of (worldly) activities.\nV-7. Renouncing the world in celibacy and becoming unclad in renunciation \u2013 such is the renouncer\ndue to dispassion. The renouncer due to (scriptural) learning is the renouncer due to wisdom. The\nrenouncer due to imperfect knowledge is the renouncer of (worldly) activity.\nV-8. Renunciation of activity is of two kinds: renunciation due to (some) cause and renunciation\nwithout (an adventitious) cause. The one with cause is the afflicted (and is at the point of death); the\ncauseless is renunciation in the regular order.\n\nThe afflicted skips over all preliminary ritual acts; it is renunciation at the point of the departure of the\nvital breath; this is renunciation due to (some) cause. Hale in body (but convinced) that created things\nare transient and hence all things such as the body are fit to be abandoned:\nV-9. \u2018The individual soul, non-different from Brahman, pervading pure ether, the sun (Vasu), remaining\nin the sky, the Fire that rests in the altar (of the universe), the Guest, residing in the house (of the\nsacrifice), residing in men, dwelling in the superior (gods), resting in truth, residing in the sky (as the\nsun), born in the waters, born on earth (as grain, etc.,) born as (sacrificial) truth, born in mountains (as\nrivers), this truth (Brahman) is (truly) great.\nV-10. Convinced that everything other than Brahman is transcient and as a result he renounces, that\nrenunciation is renunciation without (an adventitious) cause.\nV-11. Renunciation is of six kinds \u2013 Kutichaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa, Paramahamsa, Turiyatita and\nAvadhuta.\nV-12. The Kutichaka ascetic wears tuft and sacred thread, carries an (emblematic) staff and water\nvessel, puts on a loin cloth and patched garment, is devoted to the service of father, mother and\npreceptor, has recourse to the assistance of using mantras for the vessel (pithara), spade (khanitra) and\nsling (sikya), is addicted to eating food in one place, puts on the forehead a perpendicular sign of white\nsandal and has a three-fold (emblematic) staff.\nV-13. The Bahudaka ascetic wears tuft, etc., and patched garment, puts on the forehead a mark\nconsisting of three horizontal lines of holy ashes, looks on all equally like the Kutichaka and subsists\non eight mouthfuls of food gathered from (different) places like a bee.\nV-14. The Hamsa ascetic wears matted hair, puts on the forehead a horizontal mark of holy ashes or a\nperpendicular mark of sandal, subsists on food gathered without pre-determination like a bee and wears\nloincloth and khandatunda (a piece of cloth covering the mouth).\nV-15. The Paramahamsa ascetic wears no tuft or sacred thread, subsists only on food taken at night and\ngathered from five houses, has his hand serving as (alms-)bowl, wears a single loincloth and a single\ngarment, (carries) one bamboo staff or wears a single garment, smears holy ashes (all over the body)\nand renounces everything.\nV-16. The Turiyatita ascetic is \u2018cow-faced\u2019 (eats food at random without using hands), eats fruits (only)\nor if he takes cooked food, gets it from three houses (i.e. three mouthfuls), has his body just alive, is\nunclad and has his body as though it were a corpse (due to insensibility by nirvikalpa-samadhi).\nV-17. The Avadhuta ascetic follows no rules, subsists on food that comes to him, as is the practice of a\npython, from all classes of people excepting those who are accused or fallen, and is solely devoted to\nthe realization of his Self.\nV-18. If one lives in (great) affliction (of bodily infirmities), he shall renounce the world in the due\norder (by getting instruction in Pranava and the Mahavakyas from his Guru).\nV-19. To the Kutichaka, Bahudaka and Hamsa ascetics, the method of renunciation of the Kutichakas\napplies just as (renunciation is embraced after completing) the stages of brahmacharya, etc., (ending\nwith) the fourth stage (namely, renunciation).\nV-20. The rule is that the triad of the Paramahamsa, etc., has no waist band, loincloth, garment, water\nvessel or staff; their soliciting alms shall be from all classes of people and they shall be unclad. Even in\nthe stage of renunciation they may study (the scripture) till they feel fully satisfied and thereafter\ndiscard in the waters the waistband, loincloth, staff, garment and water-vessel. Then if unclad there\nshall not be any vestige of patched garment. They shall neither study nor expound (the scripture). There\nis nothing whatsoever for them worth hearing. Other than the Pranava (Om) they shall not cultivate any\nscience of logic, not even the Verbal authority (i.e. the Veda). He shall not speak much in expounding\n(sacred texts), he shall not stultify by his words the words of the great, (he shall not) communicate by\nmaking signs with his hands, etc.,, nor shall he use other special means of communication. He shall not\nspeak to the low class of people, women, the fallen and (specially to) women in their courses. To the\nascetic there is no worship of the gods, nor seeing (the deities) during festivals nor any journey on\n\npilgrimage.\nV-21. Again (on) the different kinds of ascetics. (In the rule relating) to the Kutichaka the receiving of\nalms is from one house; to the Bahudaka it is at random as in the case of a bee gathering honey; to the\nHamsa it is eight mouthfuls (collected) from eight houses, to the Paramahamsa (five mouthfuls\ncollected) from five houses, the hand being the (alms-)bowl; to the Turiyatita the food consists of fruits\nput into his mouth (gomukha); to the Avadhuta (the food comes to him) as in the case of a python, from\nall classes of people. The ascetic shall not stay many nights (in the same place). He shall not bow to\nany one. To the Turiyatita and Avadhuta none is superior. He who knows not the Self, though the eldest,\nis yet the youngest (in wisdom). He shall not swim across a river, nor climb a tree, nor travel in a\ncarriage. He shall not indulge in buying and selling, nor barter even the least. He shall not put on airs\nnor speak an untruth. There is no duty enjoined on an ascetic. If there is, then he will have to mix with\npeople practising religious observances (which is undesirable). Hence ascetics have the right (only) to\nmeditation, etc.\nV-22. The renouncer in an emergency and the Kutichaka ascetic attain the worlds of Bhur and Bhuvar\nrespectively. The Bahudaka ascetic attains heaven (Svarga). The Hamsa sage attains the (highest\nheaven of) Tapoloka. The Paramahamsa reaches the abode of Brahma and of Truth (Satyaloka). The\nTuriyatita and the Avadhuta attain final beatitude in the (individual) Self by deeply meditating on the\nSelf according to the maxim of the wasp and the worm.\nV-23. \u2018Whatever the state one remembers\nWhen discarding the body at death,\nThe same he attains (after death).\nThe teaching of the scripture is never false\u2019.\nV-24. Thus having known (the procedure), barring investigation into the nature of the Self, (the ascetic)\nshall not devote himself to any other practice. As a result of such practice there is the attainment of the\nrespective worlds (such as heaven, etc.,). By one endowed with wisdom and dispassion liberation is\n(attained) in himself; hence there is no adherence to any other practice. Adherence to (any other)\npractice (will be useless for attaining final beatitude). To the embodied (self) (there are the three states\nof) waking, dreaming and deep sleep; in the waking state (it has) the faculty to perceive individuality\n(vishva); in the dreaming state, the subtle essence of light (taijasa); in the state of deep sleep,\nintelligence dependent on individuality (prajna). Due to the difference in the state, there is the\ndifference in the conditioned Lord (Ishvara). For the difference in effect, there is the difference in the\ncause. In these (three states) the material cause for (such differences) is the external and internal\nactivity of the fourteen sensory organs. The mental states are four, the mind (manas), intelligence\n(buddhi), ego (ahamkara) and the heart (chitta). There is clear difference in practices due to the\ndifference in the activity of the mental states.\nV-25. \u2018Know (the individual Self) to be awake\nWhen it remains in the eye; when in the throat\nIt enters the dreaming (state); it is in the heart\nIn deep sleep; but remaining in the head\nIt is the fourth state (Turiya)\u2019.\nV-26. Knowing the Turiya to be the indestructible (Brahman) he who remains as though unconscious of\nall (happenings) such as whatever is heard or seen, remains as one in the state of deep sleep, though he\nis in the waking state. In him even in the dreaming state such condition (of non-consciousness)\nprevails. (The Shastras) say that he is one who is \u2018liberated while living\u2019. The exposition of the\nmeaning of all scriptures is that such a person alone attains liberation. A mendicant monk does not\nhanker after this world or the next (i.e. Svarga, the heaven of varying enjoyments with a time-limit). If\nhe has (such) expectation he becomes one in accordance with that. By (ritual) practices of the scripture\nother than investigation into the Self, he does a useless thing, like the burden borne by a camel of a load\nof saffron flowers. (for him) there is no practice of the science of Yoga, no pursuit of the lore of the\n\nSankhya, nor application of the mantras and rituals. If an ascetic practises lores other than (Selfrealization) it is like adorning a corpse. As a cobbler is far away from the performance of Vedic rituals,\nso is he from the (practice of Brahma-)vidya (by his rituals). He is not to devote himself to repeat the\nPranava. Whatever activity he does he has to reap the fruit there of. Hence discarding all (ritual acts)\nlike the foam in castor oil, and seeing the unclad ascetic engaged in it (Self-realization) with complete\ncontrol over the mind and using the hand as the (alms-)bowl, the mendicant monk shall (truly)\nrenounce (all worldly attachments). Like the child, mad man or a goblin the mendicant monk shall not\ndesire either for death or life, but shall merely mark time according to the maxim of a servant awaiting\norders.\nV-27. If an ascetic merely lives on the alms devoid of the qualities of forbearance, wisdom, dispassion,\ntranquillity, etc., he is a bane of the conduct of ascetics.\nV-28. Not by bearing an (emblematic) staff, not by a shaven head, not by (special) dress, not by\nhypocritical airs (of sage-hood) does liberation (come to one).\nV-29. He who bears the staff of wisdom is said to be \u2018single staffed\u2019. The ascetic who carries a wooden\nstick, eats all sorts of food and is devoid of wisdom goes to terrible hells called Maharaurava.\nV-30. A stable position (in a monastery) is said by great sages to be similar to the excreta of a sow;\nhence, leaving it aside, the ascetic shall move about like an (assiduous) worm.\nV-31. The Turiyatita ascetic shall have food and clothing without solicitation and just as they happen to\noccur, by others will. He shall be unclad and have a bath at others\u2019 will.\nV-32. The ascetic whose behaviour is well in harmony even with the dreaming state as with the waking\nstate, is considered the best; he is the most excellent among those that follow the Vedanta.\nV-33. In non-acquirement (of alms) he shall not grieve; in its acquisition he shall not feel joy. Avoiding\nattachment to material things he shall simply keep himself alive (for a higher purpose).\nV-34. He shall in all cases shrink from being honoured (by admiring disciples); the ascetic who\nwelcomes such honour gets bound (with worldly ties) though liberated.\nV-35. For the sake of bare subsistence an ascetic may go about for alms to the houses of approved\nclasses of people (i.e. the \u2018twice borns\u2019) at the proper time when they have dined after the fire-ritual.\nV-36. Using his hand as a vessel (for receiving food) the ascetic shall not solicit alms more than once a\nday; he may eat the food standing, he may eat the food walking. There is no ceremonial sipping of\nwater in between.\nV-37. (The ascetics) with pure thoughts keep within the limits (of good behaviour) like the sea; these\ngreat men do not abandon the prescribed course (of conduct) like the sun.\nV-38. When the ascetic seeks food with his mouth alone like a cow, he shall then be equanimous in all\nbeings; he is (then) fit for immortality.\nV-39. Going to a house which is not forbidden (for alms), he shall avoid a house which is prohibited.\nHe shall enter the house when the door is open; he shall never go towards the house when it is closed.\nV-40. He shall shelter (for the night) in a deserted house covered with dust, or he may shelter under a\ntree, giving up all likes and dislikes.\nV-41. The ascetic shall go to sleep where he is when the sun sets and be free of (ritual) fire and (fixed)\nabode. He shall live on what comes at random, self-possessed and senses subdued.\nV-42. Departing (from human habitations) and resorting to a forest, possessing true knowledge and\nsenses subdued, moving about awaiting the time (of death), (the ascetic) becomes fit for absorption into\nBrahman.\nV-43. The sage who moves about, desisting from causing fear to all beings has nowhere fear from any\nbeing.\nV-44. Free from pride and egotism, unaffected by the pairs (of opposites), with all doubts dispelled,\n(the ascetic) never gets angry nor hates (any one) and does not utter a false word.\nV-45. Moving in holy places, causing no injury to living beings and receiving alms at the proper time,\n(the sage) is fit for absorption into Brahman.\n\nV-46. He shall at no time associate himself with the forest-dwellers (Vanaprasthas) and the\nhouseholders. He shall desire to move about unobtrusively. Joy (of any kind) shall not enter him. His\npath indicated by the sun he shall walk the earth (unhurriedly) like a worm.\nV-47. Actions entailing blessing and those connected with injury as well as those intended for the\nwelfare of the world, these (the ascetic) shall neither perform nor cause others to do.\nV-48. He shall not be attached to heterodox doctrines nor pursue a means of living. He shall not indulge\nin assertive arguments nor lean to either side in a debate.\nV-49. He shall not have a following of disciples nor study many books. He shall not utilise a\ncommentary nor initiate inaugural functions anywhere.\nV-50. Without displaying any distinctive emblem or motive the ascetic shall show himself to the people\nas a mad man or a child or a dumb person though he is (all) wise.\nV-51. He shall neither do nor speak on anything. He shall have no thoughts good or bad. Delighting in\nthe Self, the sage shall move about, leading this way of life.\nV-52. He shall move about the country alone, free from attachment, his senses subdued, playing with\nand rejoicing in the Self, self-possessed, equanimous.\nV-53. Wise (but) playful like a child, well versed but appearing dull-witted, (the ascetic) shall journey.\nLearned, he may speak like a mad man. Seeking food like a cow he shall walk in the path of the\nUpanishads.\nV-54-55. Disregarded, insulted, deceived, envied, beaten, obstructed or made to suffer by denial of food\nby wicked people or when faeces and urine are thrown at him by the ignorant and shaken in various\nways, (the ascetic) desiring welfare but fallen into difficulties shall raise himself by the (power of the)\nSelf.\nV-56-57. Honour received by the ascetic brings about great loss to the wealth of his penance (Yoga),\nbut when he is disregarded by ignorant people he attains success in the practice of Yoga (as he becomes\nfree of ego by the ordeal). Without transgressing right conduct of the good the Yogin may so move\nabout, that (ordinary) people may disregard him; but they shall never associate with him.\nV-58. They Yogin (absorbed in meditation) shall do no harm by word, thought or physical action to\nbeings such as the womb-born, the egg-born and others. He shall avoid all associations.\nV-59. Abandoning all defects, such as passion and anger as well as pride, greed, delusion, etc., the\nmendicant monk shall remain free from fear.\nV-60. Eaten food given as alms, observing silence, penance, meditation specially, (possessing) correct\nknowledge and dispassion \u2013 these are considered to be the duties of a mendicant monk.\nV-61. Wearing ochre garment, ever devoted to the Yoga of meditation, he may take shelter (for the\nnight) at the outskirts of a village, the shade of a tree or even in a temple. He shall always live on alms\nand nowhere eat food obtained from one house alone.\nV-62. A wise man (before embracing renunciation) shall always be on the move till he attains purity of\nmind; there the pure-minded shall renounce worldly life and move about here and there.\nV-63. Visualising God (the Lord Vishnu) everything, both outwardly and inwardly, he shall move about\nat all times, silent and free from impurity like the breeze.\nV-64. Equanimous in joy and sorrow, patient and forgiving, eating what comes to his hand and seeing\nwithout enmity equally on the \u2018twice-born\u2019, the cow, the horse and the deer, etc., (he shall journey).\nV-65. Meditating on Vishnu (who is) the supreme Self and the Lord (Ishana), contemplating on the\nSupreme bliss and remembering that he is Brahman alone (he shall spend the time).\nV-66. Thus having become wise and possessing complete control over the mind, turning away from\ndesires, unclad (by becoming an Avadhuta), always discarding all worldly affairs by thought, word and\ndeed and turning his face away from the illusory phenomenal world, (the sage) becomes liberated (from\nworldly bondage) by deep meditation on his Self according to the maxim of the wasp and the worm.\nThus (ends the fifth chapter of) the Upanishad.\n\nVI-1. Then Narada asked of the grandfather (Brahma): \u2018Lord, (the sage attains liberation) by that\npractice, according to the maxim of the wasp and the worm. How is that practice (accomplished) ?\u2019 The\ngod Brahma said to him: \u2018True in speech he shall lead the life, with his body remaining distinctive by\nthe (power of) wisdom and dispassion.\u2019\nVI-2. Wisdom is the (wise man\u2019s) body; know that dispassion is his life; tranquillity and self restraint\nhis eyes; the mind his face; intelligence his digit (kala) (consisting of sixteen parts beginning with\nPrana and ending with naman); the twenty-five elements his limbs, the (aggregate of the) states (of\nwaking, etc.,) his five primary elements (of earth, water, etc.,); action, devotion, wisdom and dispassion\nare the branches (i.e. hands in the form of his) waking, dreaming, deep sleep and the fourth state\n(turiya); the fourteen organs are of the form of (unstable) pillars (fixed) in slime. None the less, as a\npilot guides a boat even from a muddy place (to safety), as a mahout an (intractable) elephant, the man\nof dispassion shall bring them (organs) under his control by his discernment; and considering\neverything other than the \u2018I\u2019 (i.e. the Self) to be false and transitory, he shall always speak of himself as\nBrahman. There is nothing else for him to know other than his Self. Being thus \u2018liberated while living\u2019\n(jivanmukta) he lives as one who has fulfilled himself. He shall never say, \u2018I am not Brahman\u2019, but\n(feel) incessantly \u2018Brahman I am\u2019 in the states of waking, dreaming and deep sleep; (then) reaching the\nturiya state he shall be merged in the state of turiyatita (of disembodied final beatitude).\nVI-3. (In the fourth state of turiya) the day is the waking state, the night is the dreaming state and midnight is the state of deep sleep. In one state there are the four states. Among the fourteen organs, each of\nwhich has a single function under its control, the functions of the eye, etc., (will now be described). By\nthe eye there is the comprehension of form, by the ears that of sound, by the tongue that of taste, by the\nnose that of smell, by speech that of articulate expression, by the hand that of seizure, by the feet that of\nmovement, by the anus that of evacuation, by the genitals that of (sexual) pleasure and by the skin that\nof touch. Intelligence which comprehends objects is dependent on these (described above). (It)\ncomprehends by intelligence. It becomes conscious by the mind (chitta). It becomes conceited by the\nego. Having specially created these the individual Self (Jiva) becomes as such due to the conscious\npossession of the body. The Jiva pervades the body as a householder moves in his house conscious of\nits possession. Having understood (the nature) of the face (of consciousness) (in the lotus of the heart)\nnamely, that it experiences goodness in the eastern petal, sleep and sloth in the south-eastern, cruelty in\nthe southern, sinfulness in the south-western, sportiveness in the western, inclination to move about in\nthe north-western, tranquillity in the northern, wisdom in the north-eastern, dispassion in the pericarp,\nand thought of the Self in the filaments (the sage is left with the consciousness of the turiyatita\nBrahman alone simultaneously with the dawn of that wisdom).\nVI-4. There is in the state (of the awareness) of life, the first of the waking state, the second of\ndreaming, the third of deep sleep, the fourth of the turiya state; and the \u2018state beyond the fourth\u2019\n(turiyatita) when the four states are absent. The Self is one only (spoken of as) having the different\nstates of vishva, taijasa, prajna and tatastha (the passive state). There is (only) one luminous Being, the\nwitness, the one free of all attributes; the sage shall speak (i.e. feel) that he is Brahman (alone).\nOtherwise there are the four states of waking, etc., in the waking state, the four states of dreaming, etc.,\nin the dreaming state, the four states of deep sleep, etc., in the state of deep sleep and the four states of\nturiya, etc., in the turiya state. Not so in the state of turiyatita which is devoid of attributes. As vishva,\ntaijasa, prajna and Ishvara in the states of the gross, subtle and causal bodies, the witness remains as\none alone in all the states. Is the passive one (tatastha) the witness ? The tatastha is the not the witness.\nDue to being a witness, he is not the witness alone. The Jiva is affected by his states of doing, enjoying\nand egotism, etc. The one other than the Jiva is unaffected (by the various states). If argued that the Jiva\ntoo is unaffected, it is not so. There is the conscious feeling of the body due to the consciousness of\nbeing the Jiva and of being a Jiva due to the possession of the body. There is an intervention in the state\nof the Jiva as between the ether in the pot and the all pervading ether. It is due to this intervention alone\nthat the Jiva, pretending inhalation and exhalation investigates (into the supreme witness) by the\n\nmantra, \u2018The Hamsa (Brahman), that I am\u201d. Thus realizing (that there is really no difference between\nthe Jiva and the supreme witness) one shall abandon conscious feeling of the body; thus one becomes\nfree of the consciousness of the body. Such a one alone is said to be Brahman.\nVI-5. Giving up attachment, conquering anger, taking a very moderate diet, subduing the senses and\nblocking the gates (of the body) by his intelligence, (the ascetic) shall direct his mind towards deep\nmeditation.\nVI-6. In solitary places alone, in caves and forests, the Yogin, ever in harmony, shall always begin well\nhis meditation (on the Self).\nVI-7. In receptions, ceremonies performed in honour of the manes (Sraddhas) and sacrifices, in\nreligious processions and festivities and in the assemblies of people the knower of Yoga desiring final\nemancipation shall never be present.\nVI-8. The Yogin absorbed in meditation shall so move about that the people disregard and insult him;\nbut he shall never swerve from the path of the good.\nVI-9. The three disciplines are restraint in speech, restraint in action and perfect control of the mind; he\nwho practises these three restraints is \u2018the observer of the three disciplines\u2019 (tridandin) and is a great\nsage.\nVI-10. That ascetic is considered as the foremost of all, who goes to receive alms from different houses\nof very learned Brahmanas, as a bee does for honey, when the ritual fire emits no smoke and has burnt\nitself out.\nVI-11. He is a despicable ascetic who goes for alms continuously (without any restraint), remains in\nthat order (of ascetics) without an inward urge and has no dispassion.\nVI-12. He is considered an ascetic and no other, who, knowing that alms are specially attainable in a\nparticular house, does not go there again.\nVI-13-14. That ascetic is considered as one beyond the castes and orders (ativarnashramin) who\nrealizes the supreme truth which is free of the body, senses, etc., which is the all-witness, the spiritual\nwisdom, the self of bliss and the self-radiant. Castes and orders, etc., pertaining to the body are\ninvented by the bamboozling illusion.\nVI-15. They (the castes and orders) are never part of my Self which is of the form of pure\nconsciousness. He who realizes thus by the (teachings of the) Upanishads shall be deemed as one\nbeyond the castes and orders.\nVI-16. He whose conduct conforming to castes and orders has dropped out on visualising his Self, goes\nbeyond all (restrictions of) castes and orders and remains in the (bliss of his) Self.\nVI-17. The knowers of the truth of all the Vedas declare that man to be beyond the castes and orders\nwho is established in his Self, having reached the stage beyond his order (ashrama) an his caste (varna).\nVI-18. Therefore, Oh Narada, even the castes and the orders of other people have all been\nsuperimposed on the Self by delusion (of the ordinary people); this is not done by the knower of the\nSelf.\nVI-19. There is no (Vedic) injunction, no prohibition, no rule of exclusion or inclusion to those who\nhave realized Brahman; nor is there anything else (restricting their conduct), Oh Narada.\nVI-20-21. Unattached to all beings and even to the (attainment of the) position of the god Brahma and\nuprooting tenderness towards everything, even to his children, wealth, etc., (the novice), full of faith in\nthe path leading to liberation and desiring to acquire the wisdom of the Upanishads, should approach a\nGuru who has realized Brahman, with a present in his hand.\nVI-22. Pleasing him by rendering personal service attentively for a long time, he shall always listen\nwith great attention to (his exposition of) the truths of the Upanishads.\nVI-23. Free from \u2018mine-ness\u2019 and egotism, bereft of all attachment and always possessing tranquillity,\netc., he visualises the Atman in his Self.\nVI-24. Dispassion always dawns (on one) only when one sees the defects of worldly life. To one\ndiscontented with the life in the world renunciation will come. There is no doubt about it.\n\nVI-25. One (truly) desiring liberation is called a Paramahamsa. (Before reaching this state) the ascetic\nshall practise (in his life) the wisdom of the scripture which is evidently the one means of liberation, by\nlistening to the exposition of the Upanishads, etc.\nVI-26. In order to attain the wisdom of the scripture (that results in self-realization) the sage called the\nParamahamsa should be equipped with all the means such as tranquillity, self-restraint, etc.\nVI-27-29. Deeply intent on the practice of the (wisdom of the) Upanishads, tranquil, self restrained,\nconquering the senses, fearless, free always from \u2018mine-ness\u2019, unaffected by the pairs (of opposites),\nwithout dependants or other belongings (the ascetic) shall be clad in a tattered loincloth and be with\nshaven head; or he may be unclad. Wise, proficient in the Vedanta, practising yoga, free from \u2018mineness\u2019 and egotism, equanimous towards friends, etc., friendly to all beings, alone, the man of wisdom\nand the self-controlled \u2013 (such an ascetic) crosses (the ocean of worldly misery) and not any other.\nVI-30. (As novice) he shall be devoted to the welfare of his elders and reside a year there (in the abode\nof the Guru). He shall always be vigilant in the observance of the lesser vows (niyamas) as well as the\ngreat moral duties (yamas).\nVI-31. Then at the end (of the year) having attained the excellent Yoga of wisdom he shall move about\nthe country in conformity with (lit. without antagonizing) right conduct.\nVI-32. Thereafter at the end of another year he shall give up (even) the excellent wisdom of the\nYajnavalkya and the triad of orders (of Kutichaka, etc.,) and reach the state of the Paramahamsa.\nVI-33. And bidding farewell to the Gurus (elders and preceptors) he shall indeed move about the\ncountry, giving up all attachment, subduing anger, being very moderate in diet, and conquering the\nsenses.\nVI-34. These two (people) do not fare well due to incompatibility in their action; the householder not\nengaging himself in productive work and the mendicant monk busying himself with work.\nVI-35. On seeing a young handsome woman (he) becomes inflamed with passion, and drinking liquor\nhe becomes intoxicated. Therefore he shall avoid from afar a woman who is poison to the eye.\nVI-36. Conversing with women, as well as chatting with and sending them on errands, their dance,\nmusic and laughter and scandals about them \u2013 these (the ascetic) shall avoid.\nVI-37. Neither (ceremonial) ablution nor muttering prayers, nor worship (of the gods), nor offering\noblation to gods, nor means of accomplishing anything, nor fire-ritual, etc., is to be practised by him\nhere, Oh Narada.\nVI-38. He has not (to do) the worshipping (of gods), offering oblation to the manes, going on\npilgrimage and the observing of vows; he has neither righteous conduct (dharma) nor unrighteous\nconduct (adharma); nor has he any rule (of conduct) nor worldly action.\nVI-39-41. The Yogin shall give up all (worldly) duties and those conforming to popular practices in\nevery way. The wise ascetic, the Yogin, his mind dwelling on the highest truth, shall not destroy insects,\nworms, moths, as well as trees. With your attention always turned inward, pure, composed in mind,\nyour mind filled with the Self, discarding inward contact (with outward objects), may you, Oh Narada,\nmove freely in the world. Journeying alone the ascetic shall not move about in an anarchical country.\nVI-42. Praising none, bowing to no one, not uttering Svadha (as he worships no manes), residing in\nunstable (deserted houses) and hills the ascetic shall move about without any restraint. Thus (ends the\nsixth chapter of) the Upanishad.\nVII-1. Then asked about the restrictions to (the conduct of) the ascetic, the god Brahma said to them in\nfront of Narada. (The ascetic) being dispassionate shall reside in a fixed abode during the rains and\nmove about for eight months alone; he shall not (then) reside in one place (continuously). The\nmendicant monk shall not stay in one place like a deer out of fright. He shall not accept (any proposal\nto prolong his stay) which militates against his departure. He shall not cross a river (swimming) with\nhis hands. Neither shall he climb a tree (for fruits). He shall not witness the festival in honour of any\ngod. He shall not subsist on food from one place (alone). He shall not perform external worship of\n\ngods. Discarding everything other than the Self and subsisting on food secured as alms from a number\nof houses as a bee (gathers honey), becoming lean, not increasing fat (in the body), he shall discard (the\nfattening) ghee like blood. (He shall consider) getting food in one house alone as (taking) meat,\nanointing himself with fragrant unguent as smearing with an impure thing, treacle as an outcaste,\ngarment as a plate with leavings of another, oil-bath as attachment to women, delighting with friends as\nurine, desire as beef, the place previously known to him as the hut of an outcaste, women as snakes,\ngold as deadly poison, an assembly hall as a cemetery, the capital city as dreadful hell (Kumbhipaka),\nand food in one house as lumps of flesh of a corpse.\nDiscarding the sight of others as different from himself and also the ways of the world, leaving his\nnative place, avoiding the places previously known to him, recollecting the bliss of the Self like the joy\nof regaining a forgotten object and forgetting the pride in his body and native place, admitting that his\nbody is fit to be discarded like a corpse, he shall remain far away leaving the place of his children and\nclose relatives as a thief does when released from prison. Subsisting on food secured without effort,\ndevoting himself to meditation on Brahman and the Pranava and freed of all (worldly) activities, having\nburnt passion, anger, greed, delusion, pride, envy, etc., and unaffected by the three gunas (Sattva etc.,),\nfree of the six human infirmities (hunger, thirst, etc.,), devoid of change due to the six states (of beings\nnamely origin, existence, etc.,), true in speech, pure, not hating any one, (residing) one night in a\nvillage, five nights in a city, five nights in sacred spots, five nights in holy places on the banks of sacred\nrivers, without a fixed abode, with a steady mind, never uttering a falsehood, he may reside in\nmountain-caves; he shall journey alone, (but intent on the four months of rest during the rains,\nchaturmashya) he may journey in the company of another towards a village, and as three or four\ntowards a city.\n(The rule is) that a mendicant monk shall journey alone. He shall not allow free play to the fourteen\norgans there. Enjoying the wealth of dispassion brought on by the full knowledge (of the transient\nnature of worldly life), (firmly) resolved in himself that there is no one other than his Self and there is\nno other different from him, seeing everywhere his own form and (thus) attaining liberation while\nliving (jivanmukti), and conscious of his fourfold Self (as Otir, etc.,) till the end of the sway of\nprarabdha-karman, (the ascetic) shall live meditating on his Self till his body falls.\nVII-2. (These are) bathing at the three periods (sandhyas) of the day by the Kutichaka ascetic, twice by\nthe Bahudaka, once by the Hamsa, mental bath by the Paramahamsa, bath (i.e. smearing) of holy ashes\nby the Turiyatita, and air-bath by the Avadhuta.\nVII-3. The Kutichaka should put on the perpendicular mark of sandal on the forehead (urdhvapundra),\nthe Bahudaka the three horizontal lines of holy ashes (tripundra), the Hamsa (either) the urdhvapundra\nor the tripundra, the Paramahamsa the smearing of holy ashes, the Turiyatita the mark of sandal\n(tilakapundra), the Avadhuta none at all (or) the Turiyatita and the Avadhuta (have none at all).\nVII-4. The Kutichaka shall have a shave (in each of the six) seasons, the Bahudaka a shave (at the end\nof) two seasons, the Paramahamsa no shave or if there is, a shave in six months (at the time of the\nsolstice, ayana), and no shave to the Turiyatita and the Avadhuta.\nVII-5. The Kutichaka takes food in one house, the Bahudaka collects alms from door to door as a bee\ndoes honey, the Hamsa and the Paramahamsa use the hand as the vessel (i.e. begging bowl), the\nTuriyatita is cow-mouthed (i.e. food is placed in his mouth) and the Avadhuta takes food at random (as\ndoes a python).\nVII-6. The Kutichaka (wears) two garments, the Bahudaka one garment, the Hamsa a piece (of cloth),\nthe Paramahamsa is either unclad or wears a single loin-cloth, the Turiyatita and the Avadhuta are\nunclad (lit. they remain as at the time of birth). The Hamsa and the Paramahamsa wear a (deer-)skin,\nnot the others.\nVII-7. The Kutichaka and the Bahudaka (practise) worship of gods, the Hamsa and the Paramahamsa\nworship mentally, the Turiyatita and the Avadhuta feel, \u2018That I am\u2019 (i.e. they identify the individual soul\nwith the supreme spirit)\n\nVII-8. The Kutichaka and the Bahudaka have the right to recite mantras, the Hamsa and the\nParamahamsa to meditate (on them), the Turiyatita and the Avadhuta have no right for either of the two\n(practices), (but) the Turiyatita and the Avadhuta have the right to give instruction on the great Vedantic\ntexts; so also the Paramahamsa. The Kutichaka, the Bahudaka and the Hamsa have no right to give\ninstruction to others.\nVII-9. The Kutichaka and the Bahudaka (are to meditate on) the Pranava of men (the external Pranava\nconsisting of four mantras), the Hamsa and the Paramahamsa on the antarapranava (consisting of eight\nmantras), the Turiyatita and the Avadhuta on brahmapranava (consisting of sixteen matras).\nVII-10. The Kutichaka and the Bahudaka shall listen (to the exposition of the Vedanta), the Hamsa and\nthe Paramahamsa reflect on them, the Turiyatita and the Avadhuta have profound and repeated\nmeditation on them. The rule is that all these (ascetics) shall meditate on the Self.\nVII-11. Thus the aspirant after liberation always remembering the liberating mantra (Om) which\nenables him to cross (the ocean of) worldly life, shall live \u2018liberated while living\u2019; the ascetic shall seek\nthe means to attain final beatitude (Kaivalya) according to the rules of the special order (of the ascetic\nin which he finds himself). Thus (ends the seventh chapter of) the Upanishad.\nVIII-1. Then Narada asked the god Brahma: \u2018Be pleased to expound the saviour mantra for ending the\ncourse of worldly life\u2019. Agreeing to it the god Brahma commenced to expound it. The Om (is) Brahman\nin the mode of viewing it as made up of many separate bodies (vyashti) and as made up of parts each of\nwhich is cosubstantially the same with the whole (samashti). Which is the vyashti ? Which is the\nsamashti ? The samhara Pranava and srishti Pranava are of three kinds: the inner Pranava (AntahPranava), the outer Pranava (Bahya-Pranava) and the combined inner and outer Pranava\n(Ubhayatmaka-Pranava). The (one) Brahma-Pranava is (sometimes) the inner Pranava (consisting of\neight matras) and the practical Pranava (Vyaharika-Pranava). The outer Pranava and the Pranava of the\nsages (Arsha-Pranava). The combined inner and outer Pranava is the Virat-Pranava. The SamharaPranava, the Brahma-Pranava and the Ardhamatra-Pranava. (Thus the Brahma-Pranava is of eight\nkinds: Samhara-Pranava, Srishti-Pranava, Antah-Pranava, Bahya-Pranava, Vyavaharika-Pranava, ArsaPranava, Virat-Pranava and Ardhamatra-Pranava).\nVIII-2. The Om is Brahman. Know that the Om consisting of one syllable is the Antah-Pranava. It is\ndivided into eight (matras) \u2013 the vowel \u2018a\u2019, the vowel \u2018u\u2019, the consonant \u2018m\u2019, the half-syllable (ardhamatra) the nada, the bindu, the kala and the shakti. Hence it is not four (as its chief matras have been\nsaid to be). The vowel \u2018a\u2019 consists of ten thousand parts, the vowel \u2018u\u2019 is of a thousand parts, the letter\n\u2018m\u2019 of a hundred parts and the Ardhamatra-Pranava consists of an endless number of parts. The ViratPranava is possessed of attributes (Saguna) and the Samhara-Pranava is free of attributes (Nirguna), the\nUtpatti-Pranava consists of both (Saguna and Nirguna). The Virat-Pranava is prolated (pluta). The\nSamhara-Pranava is pluta-pluta.\nVIII-3. The Virat-Pranava consists of sixteen matras and is beyond the thirty-six primary substances.\nHow has it sixteen matras. They are enumerated: the vowel \u2018a\u2019 is the first, the vowel \u2018u\u2019 is the second,\nthe letter \u2018m\u2019 is the third, the ardhamatra is the fourth, the bindu is the fifth, the nada the sixth, the kala\nthe seventh, the kalatita the eighth, shanti the ninth, the santyatita the tenth, the unmani the eleventh,\nthe manonmani the twelfth, the puri the thirteenth, the madhyama the fourteenth, the pashyanti the\nfifteenth, and the para the sixteenth. Again the Brahma-Pranava though only one attains the state of\npossessing or not possessing attributes (Saguna and Nirguna), having attained the state of possessing\n128 matras, due to the twofold character of Prakriti and Purusha, when it has sixty-four matras each.\nVIII-4. This (Brahma-Pranava) is the prop of all, the supreme effulgence and the lord of all \u2013thus (the\nsages with true vision) look upon it. It consists of all gods and the prop of all universe (the Lord) is in\nit.\nVIII-5. It consists of all the syllables; it is the Time; it is composed of all the scripture and is the\nauspicious one (Shiva). It is the most excellent of all the Vedas and consists of (the essence) of all the\n\nUpanishads; this (Om, the Atman) should be sought.\nVIII-6. Past, present and future constitute the three periods \u2013 the indestructible syllable Om (pervades\nand transcends) these; know that it is the beginning (of everything) and the bestower of final beatitude.\nVIII-7. The same (Om) which is the Atman has been described by the word Brahman. Similarly\nexperiencing it as the one (without a second), the ageless, the immortal, the Om and super-imposing the\nOm along with the body (on Brahman) it becomes one with it. Know it for certain then that the triplebodied Atman is the supreme Brahman.\nVIII-8. One should deeply meditate on the supreme Brahman in the due order of Vishva, etc., (the\nVishva, the Viraj, the Otir and the Turya).\nVIII-9-11. This Atman is fourfold \u2013 as experiencing the gross aspect (as the Vishva) when it is an\nindividual in the gross aspect, as enjoying (the world) in the dreaming state in a subtle form when it has\nassumed the subtle form (of the Taijasa), as (enjoying bliss) in the state of identity (of the Prajna and\nthe Ishvara), and as enjoying bliss (in the Turya state). The Atman is of four padas (quarters). The\nVishva consisting of four stages (Vishva-Vishva, Vishva-Taijasa, Vishva-Prajna and Vishva-Turya) is\nthe Purusha Vaishvanara. It functions in the waking state. It perceives gross forms (of the phenomenal\nworld) and experiences them. It possesses nineteen faces (the five organs of perception, the five organs\nof action, the five vital airs and the four inner senses of manas, buddhi, ahamkara and chitta), has eight\nlimbs (the sky as the head, the sun and the moon the two eyes, the directions the ears, the sea the lower\npart of the abdomen, the earth the feet), moves everywhere and is the master (Prabhu).\nVIII-12-13. This Vishva (jit) is the first pada (of the Atman).\n[The Vishva (the Vishvapada of the Atman) has four aspects in the four states of waking, dreaming,\ndeep sleep and the Turya. In the waking state it functions through the senses and experiences the sight,\netc., of objects. This is the waking within the waking state (jagrat-jagrana). Its experiencer in the\nindividual aspect is the Vishva-Vishva (the Vishva subdivision of the Vishvapada of the Atman); it is\nVirat-Viraj in the collective aspect. It is Otir-Otir in the individual and collective aspects. When the\nmind grasps objects without the functioning of the senses it is dreaming within the waking state (jagratsvapna); its experiencer is Vishva-Taijasa (the Taijasa subdivision of the Vishva). When one is not\nconscious of anything but remains as if unconscious then it is sleep within the waking state (jagratsusupti); its experiencer is the Vishva-Prajna (the Prajna subdivision of the Vishva). When one is in\nequanimity due to the grace of the Guru or the fruition of one\u2019s good deeds (punya), as if one were in\nSamadhi, and behaves like an onlooker (sakshin) it is the Turya in the waking state (jagrat-turya). Its\nexperiencer is the Vishva-Turya (the Turya subdivision of the Vishva)].\nThe second pada (of the Atman the Taijasa, too, has four aspects (the Taijasa-Vishva, the TaijasaTaijasa, the Taijasa-Prajna and the Taijasa-Turya) and is the lord of beings, the Hiranyagarbha. It\nfunctions as the master in the dreaming state. It perceives subtle forms (of the phenomenal world) and\nexperiences them. Though possessing eight limbs it is one and not different, Oh Narada (lit. the\ntormentor of foes).\nVIII-14-16. [When in the dreaming state the Atman experiences the sight, etc., of objects with dreameyes, etc., without the active functioning of the mind then there is the waking within the dreaming state\n(svapna-jagarana) and its experiencer is the Taijasa-Vishva (the Vishva subdivision of the Taijasa). Its\nexperiencer is the Sutra-Viraj in the collective aspect of the experiences of the svapna-jagarana state; it\nis the Otir subdivision of the Anujnatir in the individual and collective aspects. When in the dreaming\nstate the Atman enjoys the objects by the mind alone without the functioning of the dream-eyes, etc.,\nand the svapna-jagarana state, it is the state of svapna-svapna (dreaming within the dreaming state). Its\nexperiencer is the Taijasa-taijasa (the Taijasa subdivision of the Taijasa pada of the Atman). When there\nis no experience of the svapna-jagarana and the svapna-svapna states and there is no perception either\nby the dream-eyes, etc., or by the mind and there is a total forgetfulness of external objects and of\noneself, that state of insensibility is the svapna-susupti (the state of deep sleep within the dreaming\nstate). The Atman who experiences this state is the Taijasa-Prajna (the Prajna subdivision of the Taijasa\n\npada of the Atman). When due to the fruition of one\u2019s good deeds there are no perceptions of the three\nprevious states of the dreaming state and the Atman remains in the Turya state of the dreaming state,\nwhen there shines a neutral state (the state of a witness) of generic and particular experiences of the\nexternal world and of the inner senses, that state is svapna-turya (the Turya subdivision of dreaming\nstate) and the Atman who experiences this is the Taijasa-Turya (the Turya subdivision of the Taijasa\npada of the fourfold Atman].\nWhen one is asleep and neither hankers after desire nor sees any dream, that is clearly deep sleep. In\nthis state functions the four-fold Prajna (as Prajna-Vishva, Prajna-Taijasa, Prajna-Prajna and PrajnaTurya), which is termed the third pada of the Atman. This Atman is one, remains in the state of deep\nsleep, possesses the fullness of wisdom, enjoys happiness, consists of everlasting bliss and remains in\nthe heart of all beings; yet he enjoys bliss, has the mind for his face, is omnipresent and indestructible\nand is the Ishvara.\nVIII-17. He is the lord of all, omniscient and subtle in conception. He permeates all beings; he is the\nprime source, the origin and the destruction of all.\nVIII-18. All these three stages (of waking, dreaming and deep sleep) are a hindrance to the annihilation\nof all activities to beings (i.e. for self-realization); hence they are akin to the state of deep sleep; it is\nreally dream-stuff and has been said to be an illusion alone. [In the state of deep sleep when the person\nremaining in either of the two states of waking or dreaming desires to move to the state of deep sleep\nand experiences the false notion of form, etc., of objects with the eyes, etc., then it is the state of\nwaking within deep sleep (susupti-jagrat); its experiencer in the individual aspect is the Vishva\nsubdivision of the Prajna; in its collective aspect it is the Viraj subdivision of the Bijatman; in the\ncombined individual and collective aspect it is the Anujnaikarasotir. In the state of deep sleep when the\nAtman is free of the false notion of form, etc., of external objects and occupying a position in either of\nthe waking or dreaming states experiences the false notions of form, etc., of objects, it is the state of\ndreaming with in deep sleep (svapna-svapna). The experiencing Atman then is the Prajna-Taijasa (the\nTaijasa subdivision of the Prajna). Again in deep sleep when the Atman, though experiencing the false\nnotion of form, etc., of objects with the false activities (of seeing, etc.), which pervade one\u2019s\nconsciousness (Chaitanya), is yet not experiencing them as if stagnant, then it is the state of deep sleep\nwithin deep sleep. The experiencing Atman then is the Prajna-Prajna (the Prajna subdivision immanent\nin the Prajna). Again in the state of deep sleep when the Atman enjoys bliss, remaining as the witness\nof the experiences of the three previous stages in deep sleep, then it is the Turya state of deep sleep and\nthe experiencing Atman is the Prajna-Turya (the Turya subdivision of the Prajna)].\nVIII-19-20. The fourth (pada, the Turya) though fourfold (as Turya-Vishva, Turya-Taijasa, TuryaPrajna and Turya-Turya) is indeed the one essence of pure consciousness, for the reason that each one\nof these (Vishva, etc.,) culminates in the Turya state. (The Turya state) forms the basis for the\ndifferentiation (of the Atman) as Otir, Anujnatir and Anujnana (i.e. Anujnanaikarasa). These three\ndifferent states are (really) susupta (as they merely constitute a veil of the Turya-Turya which is\nsupreme bliss) and consists of an inward dream-stuff. Knowing that (anything other than the TuryaTurya) is mere illusion, there remains the next moment the one essence of pure consciousness.\nVIII-21. [As the Turya-Turya, being the one state of bliss, is incapable of subdivisions in the individual,\ncollective, and partly individual and partly collective aspects, the Turya by itself is not of a fourfold\nnature, but only three (excluding the Turya-Turya). This threefold nature of the Turya may be explained\nthus: As there are distinctions in external objects, the knower of Brahman perceives them with his\nsenses, but without distinction; this state is the turya-jagarana; the Atman who experiences this state\nindividually is the Turya-Vishva, collectively it is the Turya-Viraj, partly individual partly collective it\nis the Avikalpa-Otir. When the knower of Brahman, with all sense-activities abated, perceives the\noneness of the Self with Brahman by his mind alone it is the state of turya-svapna; the Atman who\nexperiences this is the Turya-Taijasa. When the person is in distinctionless deep meditation\n(Nirvikalpa-samadhi) and remains as if in a state of suspended animation, it is the state of turya-susupti\n\nand the experiencing Atman is the Turya-Prajna.]\nHere is the distinct precept that the Turya-Turya is not at any time gross wisdom, (as it is not the Otrotir\nwhich is the same as Vishva-Vishva and the Viraj-Viraj, experiencing the jagrat-jagarana state), nor\nindeed the subtle sentience (as it is different from the Taijasa, Sutra and Anujnatir of the Svapnajagarana state), nor pure consciousness (Prajna), (as it is different from the Otir-Avikalpa, the same as\nthe Vishva, the Viraj and the Turya of the form of consciousness disclosing the presence or absence of\nthe jagrat-jagarana and other states), nor anywhere else, Oh sage.\nVIII-22. It is not non-consciousness (Aprajna) (as it is far away from the Anujnatir-Otir, identical with\nthe Taijasa-Vishva and the Sutra-Viraj that are without outward perception in the svapna-jagarana\nstate), nor of both gross and subtle consciousness (as it is outside the scope of Otir-Anujnaikarasa,\nidentified with the Vishva-Prajna and the Viraj-Bija of the jagrat-svapna state which is outside the\nprovince of true knowledge), nor exclusive intelligence (as it is not within the scope of AnujnatirAnujnaikarasa, identified with the Taijasa-Prajna and the Sutra-Bija of the form of exclusive\nintelligence functioning in the svapna-svapna state) and is never perceptible (as it is beyond the range\nof the Anujnatir-Anujnatir, identified with the taijasa-Taijasa and the Sutra-Sutra deluded by the vision\ncreated by the mind in the svapna-svapna state).\nVIII-23. It cannot be defined (as it is different from the Anujnaikarasa-Anujnatir, identified with the\nPrajna-Taijasa and the Bija-Sutra which can be known only through the ignorance of the Atman in the\nsvapna-svapna state), cannot be grasped (as it is different from the Anujnaikarasa-Otir, identified with\nthe Prajna-Vishva and the Bija-Viraj, which can be grasped through the ignorance of the Atman in the\nsvapna-jagarana state), is incapable of being expressed (as it is different from the Anujnatir-Avikalpa,\nidentified with the Taijasa-Sutra-Turiya, which manifests the presence or absence of the svapnajagarana and other states in the svapna-turya state), is beyond thought (as it is outside the\nAnujnaikarasa-Anujnaikarasa, identified with the Prajna-Prajna and the Bija-Bija in the svapa-svapa\nstate, having only the recollection, \u2018I know not anything of that state\u2019), is incapable of being given a\nname (as it is untouched by the perception of the Anujnaikarasa-Avikalpa, identified with the PrajnaBija-Turya, that could be named as the witness of the presence or absence of the svapna-jagarana and\nsimilar states in the svapna-turya state), is also the essence of the conviction in the one Atman (as it is\ndifferent from the perceptions of the Avikalpa-Otir, identified with the Turya-Vishva-Viraj,\nexperiencing the turya-jagarana state), is the annihilation of worldly life (as it cannot bear even the\nsmell of the Avikalpa-Anujnatir, identified with the Turya-Taijasa-Sutra which in some cases does not\nput an end to worldly life and which experiences the turya-svapna state), is quiescent (as it differs from\nthe experience of the Avikalpa-Anujnaikarasa, identified with the Turya-Prajna-Bija experiencing the\nturya-svapna state), is the auspicious one (as it is the same as final beatitude \u2013 Kaivalya \u2013 in the\ndisembodied state) and is the non-dual one (as it is of the form of the supreme non-dual state without a\ncounter-part) \u2013 this (the knowers of Brahman) consider as the fourth (the turya-turya); it is the (same as\nthe) Brahma-Pranava. This should be realized and not any other (called) turya. This (turya-turya) is the\nprop to the seekers after liberation as the sun (to the phenomenal world); it is self-effulgent (as it is the\nsource of lustre to the sun, etc.,); it is the ether of Brahman (as it is without a counter-part); it always\nshines as it is the transcendent Brahman. Thus (ends the eighth chapter of) the Upanishad.\nIX-1. Then Narada inquired: \u2018How is the real form of Brahman ?\u2019 The god Brahma answered\n(expounding) the real form of Brahman. Those who consider that He (the transcendent Brahman) is one\nand himself (the individual self) as another are beasts, though not beasts in their (true) nature. The wise\n(sage) having realized thus (that the individual Self and Brahman are identical) is released from the\njaws of death (i.e. belief in duality results in death and renunciation-birth; that in non-duality, in\nimmortality). There is no other path known to reach the goal (of final beatitude).\nIX-2. Time (is the root-cause of worldly life, say some philosophers), Nature (say the Mimamsakas),\nchance (say the atheists), the (five) elements (say the Jainas who believe in the eternality of the world),\n\nMatter (Prakriti) (say the Saktas), the Purusha (Hiranyagarbha) (say the Yogins) \u2013 thus the speculation\n(on the cause of worldly life). The combination of these is not (the cause) on account of the existence\nof the Self. The Self too is incapable (of being the cause) on account of its being subject to happiness\nand misery.\nIX-3. They (the knowers of Brahman) resorting to the Yoga of deep meditation perceived the power\n(Maya) of the self-luminous Atman, well hidden by its own attributes (of Sattva, etc.,), who, alone,\ngoverns all these causes including Time and the individual Self.\nIX-4. (Maya, under the guidance of the Saguna-Brahman \u2013 Ishvara \u2013 created the universe. Brahman\nitself does not perform any action as it is nishkriya). (They perceived) that (world resembling the wheel\nof a chariot) in one felly (Maya), covered with three (the gods Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, possessing\nthe power of creation, sustenance and withdrawal of the world, due to the association with the three\ngunas), possessing sixteen powers (kalas), having fifty spokes with twenty nails (in the form of the\nsenses and their objects), having six groups of eight (astakas) with one fetter (desire) of many forms,\nwith three kinds of paths, and having delusion which is the cause of the two (goodness and sin, based\non love and hatred).\nIX-5. We think of that (river) the water of which flows in five ways (currents), which has five fierce\nmouths due to five causes, the waves of which are the five vital airs, whose source is (the ego) which\ncontrols the five senses of perception, which has five whirlpools, whose speed of flow consists of the\nfive miseries, which has fifty divisions and which has five junctures.\nIX-6. In this wheel of Brahman which is (the cause of) the life of all, (the substratum of) the dissolution\nof all and extensive (far vaster than the sky), the Hamsa (the Paramatman in the form of the individual\nSelf) is revolved. Having considered himself as separate (as the individual Self, as the ether in the pot\nwith reference to the all-pervading ether), and Brahman as the controlling Self (he is revolved in the\nwheel of worldly life); and then becoming beloved by Him (on realizing the truth in 'Thou art That',\nand \u2018I am Brahman\u2019) (the individual soul) attains immortality.\nIX-7. This (described before as different from the Saguna Brahman, or Ishvara) has indeed been sung\n(in the Upanishads) as the supreme Brahman; on Him (the essence of the Pranava) the triad (is superimposed) and it is the support (of the phenomenal world) which is in itself; it is imperishable. Knowers\nof the Veda realizing the difference (between the Self and Brahman to be false) and being completely\ndevoted to Him are absorbed in the transcendent Brahman.\nIX-8. The Lord sustains the universe unified (by cause and effect), the perishable (phenomenal world)\nand the imperishable (Maya), the manifested (Nature) and the unmanifested (cause, Maya). The\nindividual Atman is considered to be powerless due to its nature of being an experiencer (of pleasure\nand pain); having realized the self-effulgent Being, he becomes free of all bonds.\nIX-9. The omniscient and the ignorant are the two uncreated beings; the (former) is the Lord and (the\nother) the powerless (anisha); there is indeed the one uncreated (Prakriti) which is intended for the\nthings of experience and the experiencer The (transcendent) Atman is unlimited and omnipresent and is\nnot an agent (of actions). When (one) realizes these three (Ishvara, the individual Self and Prakriti) to\nbe Brahman (one becomes Brahman).\nIX-10. Prakriti (Pradhana) is perishable; the Lord (Hara, who dispels ignorance) is immortal and\nimperishable. The one self-effulgent Being rules over the perishable (Prakriti) and the individual\nAtman. By repeated deep meditation on Him and concentration of the mind (in Yoga, \u2018I am He\u2019) and by\nthe realization of true reality, (there shall be) the disappearance of the universal illusion (Maya) at the\nend (of one\u2019s ignorance).\nIX-11. Having realized the self-effulgent Lord (as identical with the Self) one is released from all\nbonds; with all miseries destroyed there will be an end to births and deaths. By deeply meditating on\nthat (that he is no other than that reality) and when the difference between the body (and the Self has\ndisappeared) (the sage) realizes the third supreme state (of the Parameshvara) and (therein) final\nbeatitude (kevala), and (thus) has fulfilled himself.\n\nIX-12. This (Brahman) should be realized (as oneself), it is everlasting and present as the individual\nAtman; for there is nothing other than that that is worthy of realization. Having considered (with\nillusory vision) the experiencer (individual Atman), the objective world (of experience) and the Ishvara\n(ruler) (as different), (know) that all this triad has been well declared (by the knowers of the Vedanta) to\nbe Brahman (alone).\nIX-13. The means of realizing this Brahman is the Brahma-Vidya (the teaching of the Upanishads) and\npenance (i.e. deep meditation); it is solely dependent on the Upanishads (for its realization).\nIX-14. To one who thus understands and meditates on one\u2019s Self alone, \u2018What delusion is there, what\nsorrow, to one who beholds oneness ?\u2019 Hence (the separateness of) Viraj, the past, the present and the\nfuture (disappears and they) become of the form of the indestructible (Brahman).\nIX-15. Subtler than the atom, greater than the great, the Self is situated in the heart of this (every)\ncreature. One sees this transcendent Lord who is free from passions by the grace of the creator and\n(thus) becomes freed from sorrow.\nIX-16. Having no hands and feet, (the Lord) moves fast and grasps (objects); without eyes He sees;\nwithout ears He hears. He knows things to be known (without a mind, as he is omniscient); no one\nknows Him. (knowers of the Vedanta) speak of Him as the foremost transcendental Purusha (the\nsupreme Consciousness).\nIX-17. The wise (Yogin) does not feel sorrow, having realized the Atman who is bodiless, transcendent\nand all pervading and who is present in (all) bodies which are impermanent.\nIX-18. This transcendent (Being) the prop of all (as Vishnu), whose powers are beyond (the reach of)\nthought, who is to be realized by the esoteric meaning of all the Upanishads, and who is greater than\nthe (indestructible) great, ought to be realized; at the end of everything (phenomenal) the emancipator\n(lit. the harbinger of death to avidya) ought to be known.\nIX-19. The (all-)wise, the (most) ancient, the most exalted of sentient beings, the Lord of all, the one\nadored by all gods, and devoid of beginning, middle and end, the infinite, the indestructible and the\nprop (lit. the mountain) to (the gods) Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma (should be realized).\nIX-20. All this Universe made up of the five elements and remaining in the five, which becomes\nendless in variety by their quintuplication is pervaded by him (the Atman as Antaryamin, etc.,); but it is\nunencompassable by the parts (thus) quintuplicated; (for) it is the highest of the high and greater than\nthe great, and eternal auspiciousness by the effulgence of its own form. (Thus the seeker after liberation\nshould realize the Self as Brahman).\nIX-21. Neither one who has not refrained from bad conduct, nor one who is not peaceful, nor one\nwithout concentrated meditation, nor one whose mind is not quiescent can realize him (Brahman) by\n(mere) knowledge (of the scripture). (By the one gaining true knowledge (Prajnana) by refraining from\nthe evils described above realizes Brahman).\nIX-22. The Self (remaining in oneself) reveals itself neither to one (who considers it) as inwardly wise,\nnor as outwardly wise, nor as gross, nor as subtle, nor as knowledge, nor as ignorance, nor as\nknowledge of both (external and internal), nor as conceivable, nor as directly connected with worldly\nactivities. He who realizes it thus becomes liberated; he becomes liberated. Thus said the god Brahma.\nIX-23. The mendicant monk is a knower of the real nature of the Self. The mendicant monk journeys\nalone (as duality is foreign to him even in a crowd). Like a deer timid through fear, he remains (without\nmixing with company). He does not stand in the way (of others\u2019 progress). Discarding everything other\nthan his (bare) body, sustaining his life in the manner of a bee (by collecting food from different places)\nand deeply meditating on his Self and without seeing any difference in all things from his own Self, he\nbecomes liberated. This mendicant monk abstaining from being the agent of all (worldly) actions, freed\nfrom (duties of) the preceptor, disciple, scripture, etc., and discarding all bands of the phenomenal\nworld, is untouched by delusions. How can the mendicant monk devoid of wealth be happy ? He is rich\n(as he has the wealth of Brahman), beyond both knowledge and ignorance, beyond pleasure and pain,\nillumined by self-effulgence, celebrated among all (people), omniscient, the giver of all great powers,\n\nthe lord of all \u2013 thus he considers himself. That is the highest place of Lord Vishnu where the Yogins,\nhaving reached it never return (therefrom). The sun shines not there, nor does the moon. He never again\nreturns (to worldly life), he never returns. That is final beatitude (Kaivalya). Thus (ends) the\nUpanishad. End of the ninth chapter (and the Upanishad).\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm !

    "Trisikhi": "\nTrisikhi Brahmana Upanishad\nTranslated by P. R. Ramachander\nPublished by celextel.org\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nA Brahmin called \u2018Trishiki Brahmana\u2019 went to the land of Sun God and asked him, \u201cOh God, What is\nbody? What is soul? What is the cause and what is Athma?\u201d 1\nThe Sun God replied:\nYou have to realize that all this is Shiva. Because only Shiva is ever clean, who is devoid of any\nblemishes, and who is everywhere and for whom there is no second. He is the only one who creates\neverything by his light and similar to the fire appearing in different forms on different pieces of steel,\nhe appears in different forms. If you ask, to what he gives light, the answer would be, Brahmam which\nis denoted by the word, \u201cSath\u201d, and which is merged with ignorance and illusion. That Brhamam gave\nrise to, \u201cthat which is not clear\u201d. \u201cThat which is not clear\u201d gave rise to, \u201cMahat (great)\u201d. \u201cMahat\u201d gave\nrise to egoism. Egoism gave rise to \u201cFive Thanmathras\u201d. That \u201cFive Thanmathras\u201d gave rise to \u201cFive\nBhoothas\u201d viz earth, water, fire air and ether.\n1. Ether is consciousness viz mind, wisdom, self will, and egoism\n2. Air is Samana, Udhana, Vyana, Apana and Prana which are the airs in the body.\n3. Fire is ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose.\n\n4. The concept of water is feelings of sound, touch, view, taste and smell.\n5. Earth is words, hands, legs and other physical organs.\n6. Ether which is the concept of wisdom is decision, behavior and self esteem.\n7. The actions related to air are uniting, changing of places, taking, hearing and breathing.\n8. The actions related to fire are the feeling of touch, sight, taste, view and sound. These also depend on\nwater.\n9. The actions related to earth are talking, giving, taking, going and coming.\n10. The actions of the Prana Thanmathra (Symbolic soul) are the organs for doing work and organs for\nearning wisdom.\n11. Egoism is limited to mind, brain and the will to do.\n12. The micro aspects of the symbolic soul (Prana Thanmathra) are giving place, scattering, seeing,\nuniting and being firm.\nThese twelve are the aspects of philosophy, early concept of godliness and early concept of physical\nexistence. Chandra, Brahma, directions, air, sun, Varuna, Aswini devas (divine doctors), Fire, Indra\n(king of devas), Upendra, Prajapathi and Yama (God of death) are the Gods of the organs and senses\nwho travel like soul in these twelve aspects. 1\n[Slokas 2 & 3 are not available.]\nFrom there, Earth came in to existence, embracing one thing with the other, pervading by criss-cross\nconnections, step by step as the result of Pancha Boothas (Five aspects of earth, air, water, fire and\nether) gained life. 4\nIn that earth, plants, climbers, food and four types of pindas (body centers) arose. The root sections of\nthe body are taste, blood, flesh, fat, bones, nerves and semen. 5\nSome Pindas arose because of their own interaction and some Pindas arose because of the interaction of\nPancha Boothas. In this that Pinda called \u201cAnna Mayam (area of food)\u201d is in the area of the belly. 6\nIn the middle of this body is the heart which is like the lotus flower with its stalk. The Gods for\nmanagement, egoism and action are in there. 7\nThe seed for this is the thamo guna (baser qualities) pinda which is passion oriented and solidified\n(does not move or change). This is the world with its varied nature and is situated in the neck. 8\nThe inside looking happy Athma (soul) is on the summit of the head and is situated in the Parama Patha\nplace. This is in its earth like form and shines with great strength. 9\nThe state of awakening is every where. The state of dream is also is there in the state of wakefulness.\n\nThe state of sleep and the state of higher knowledge (Thuriya) is not there in other states. 10\nSimilar to the tastes pervading in all parts of a good fruit, Shiva Shakthi pervades every where. 11\nSimilarly all kosas (area of the body) are within Annamaya Kosa. Similar to the kosam is the soul.\nSimilar to the soul is Shiva. 12\nThe living being is one with feelings. Shiva is one without feelings. The kosas are the places of feelings\nof living being. And they give rise to states of existence. 13\nSimilar to the fact that churning of water produces ripples and foam, by churning of mind several\npainful thoughts are produced. 14\nBy performing duties, the living being, becomes the slave to those duties. By forsaking them, he attains\npeace. He becomes one, who sees the world in southern path. 15\nThe living being with egoism and self esteem is indeed Sadashiva. The living being attains that type of\nillusion because of his company with the ignorant soul. 16\nHe attains hundreds of yonis (female reproductive organ) and stays there because of familiarity. Like a\nfish traveling in between the banks of a river, he keeps on traveling till he attains salvation. 17\nOver passage of time due to the wisdom of the knowledge of the soul, he turns on the northern path and\nstep by step goes up. 18\nWhen he is able to send his soul power to his head and does permanent practice of Yoga, he gets\nwisdom. Because of wisdom, his yoga acts. 19\nOnce Yoga and wisdom become stable in him, he becomes a yogi. He will never be destroyed. He\nwould see Lord Shiva in his deficiencies and will not see deficiencies in Lord Shiva. 20\nTo get results of yoga, it has to be done without any other thought. Without practice you will not\nsucceed in Yoga or wisdom. The yogi will not get the results out of these also. 21\nSo by practice of yoga, mind and soul should be controlled. The Yogi should cut off the problems in\nyoga similar to the cutting of material with a sharp knife. 22\n[Slokas 23 to 145 are not available.]\nWith pure knowledge of Athma (soul) the sensory organs should be controlled. We should always\nmeditate on Para Vasudeva who is the greatest soul. 146\nKaivalya (salvation) is attained by the selected and sorted form of meditation on shape and form. If a\nyogi is able to meditate at least for a small time on Vasudeva while he is in the Kumbhaka stage of\nPranayama, the sins that he has done in seven births will be destroyed. You have to understand that the\nportion from belly to the heart is the wakeful action. In the neck, there exists the action of the dream. In\nbetween the Jaws exists the sleep. Thuriya exists in between the eyelids. That action of synthesis with\nParabrahmam which is much above thuriya exists in the skull top middle called Brahmarandra. There\nin the foremost thuriya corner of thuriya , the soul is called Vishnu. When one meditates in the very\n\npure Paramakasa (great ether), he should meditate on that Adhokshaja who shines for ever with the\nlight of crores of Suns, as sitting in the lotus of his own heart. Otherwise he has to meditate on that\nViswa Roopi(One who is of the form of universe), who has several forms, several faces, several planks\nwith several armaments, several eyes which shine like crores of suns, several colours and who is\npeaceful and also very angry. All the mental preoccupations of a Yogi who meditates in such a manner\nwill be completely calmed down. That Yogi who meditates on that indestructible matter which shines\nlike God\u2019s grace in the center of the heart, on that ultimate truth which is beyond Thuriya, on that Sun\nwho is the form of wisdom which is immeasurable and unending, on that being who is like a shining\nlamp in a windless place and on that being who is like the shine of unprocessed gems, would have\nsalvation in his grip. 147-157\nTo that Yogi who is able to see and experience the shine of that deva with the universal macro or micro\nform or atleast a small portion of him in his lotus like heart, all the occult powers like Anima would be\nvery much within his reach. 158-159\nOne has to understand that the realization of the universal truth of the unity of Jeevathma (Soul) and\nParamathma (God) which is that \u201cI am Brhamam and Brahmam is me\" is he real state of Samadhi (an\nenlightened state of meditation where all the thought process are unified with God). That man becomes\nBrahmam and he does not take another birth. 160-161\nThe one who examines such principles with detachment becomes like a fire without wood and becomes\none with himself. 162\nSince his mind and soul does not have anything to catch hold of (get attached), he becomes stable in the\nform of wisdom, and his soul melts like a piece of salt and he merges in to the sea of pure\nconsciousness. 163\nHe sees the word which is a thing of passion and magic like a dream. In the natural state that Yogi\nstands without changing as him to himself and attains the nude form in his sleep and attains salvation.\n164\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Trisikhi-Brahmanopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Sita": "\nSita Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! Gods ! With ears let us hear what is good;\nAdorable ones ! With eyes let us see what is good.\nWith steady limbs, with bodies, praising,\nLet us enjoy the life allotted by the gods.\nMay Indra, of wide renown, grant us well-being;\nMay Pusan, and all-gods, grant us well-being.\nMay Tarksya, of unhampered movement, grant us well-being.\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\n1. The gods, indeed, said to Prajapati: who is Sita ? What is Her form ? Then Prajapati replied: She is\nSita:\n2. Being the first cause Sita is known as\nPrakriti; of Pranava, too, She is cause\nAnd so is named Prakriti.\n3. Maya in very essence,\nIs Sita, of three letters formed.\nCalled Vishnu, the world-seed,\nAnd Maya, too, is the letter i.\n4. The letter sa denotes truth immortal;\nAchievement; Siva with his consort.\nTa denotes the Queen of Speech\nUnited with Brahman, the Deliverer.\n5. The Goddess who is the great Illusion, whose form is unmanifest, and who is denoted by \u2018i\u2019 becomes\nmanifest, beauteous as the moon, faultless of limb, decked with ornamental garlands, pearls and other\nadornments.\n6. At first, at the time of Vedic studies, She is essentially the clear Vedic speech. Secondly, on earth, at\n\nthe tip of the plough She springs up, who, as the bliss of Brahman-realization, is ever present. Thirdly,\nas denoted by \u2018i\u2019 She becomes unmanifest. So is She Sita. Thus they explain in the text of the\nSaunakas.\n7. By Srirama\u2019s (light of total liberation) presence enabled\nThe universe She sustains;\nAll embodied beings\nShe brings forth, sustains and withdraws.\n8. Sita must be known;\nShe is the first cause;\nAs Om is She that cause,\nDeclare the Brahman-knowers.\n9. Now, therefore, inquiry into Brahman.\n10. She here is all the Vedas; all the gods; all the worlds; all renown; all virtue; all ground, effect and\ncause; the great Beauty of the Lord of gods. She has a form which is different and yet the same. She is\nthe essence of the intelligent and the inert. She is all, from Brahma to stocks and stones. She is\nembodied, owing to distinctions of attributes and activities. She assumes the forms of gods, sages, men\nand Gandharvas; of demons, fiends, spirits, ghosts, goblins, etc.; and of the elements, sense-organs,\nmind and the vital breaths.\n11. That divine Being is threefold through Her power, namely the power of desire, the power of action,\nand the power of knowledge.\n12. The power of desire is threefold: Sri, Bhumi and Nila. Auspiciousness is the form (of Sri); the\npower (of holiness) is the form (of Bhumi); the sun, the moon, and the fire are the forms (of Nila).\n13. As the moon (She) is the mistress of the herbs; She is the tree of plenty, flowers, fruits, creepers and\nbowers; the mistress of medicinal plants and physicians; She is the divine draught of immortality,\nyielding the fruit of massive splendour. She satisfies the gods with ambrosia and the animals with grass\non which, respectively, the gods and the animals live.\n14. She illumines all worlds, day and night, in the garb of the sun, etc. As determinations of time, such\nas the smallest moment, hour, day with its eight divisions, day of the week, and night, as also the\nfortnight, month, season, six months, and year and as the prescriber of the term of human life as a\nhundred years, She manifests herself and is known as Delay and Speed. Thus wheel-like, She revolves\nas the wheel of Time, the wheel of Universe, etc.; comprising (all dimensions of time) from the\nmoment up to fifty years of Brahma\u2019s life. All the luminous temporal divisions are the specific\ndeterminations of this very Time, the container of all.\n15. As fire is the food and drink of living beings, their hunger and thirst. As regards the gods, She has\nthe form of sacrifice. As regards the herbs in the forest, She is the coolness and the warmth. Both inside\nand outside the fuel She dwells, eternal and fleeting.\n16. The Goddess Sri assumes a threefold form in conformity with the Lord\u2019s will for the protection of\nthe world. That She is styled Sri and Lakshmi is known.\n17. The Goddess Bhu is the Earth comprising the seven islands and the seas; the container and the\ncontents of the fourteen worlds such as bhu, etc.; and her essence is Pranava.\n18. Nila is festooned with lightnings. To nourish all herbs and living beings, She assumes all forms.\n19. At the root of all the worlds, She assumes the form of Water, being known as \u2018consisting of frogs\u2019\nand supporting the worlds.\n20. The real form of the power of action (is as follows): From Hari\u2019s mouth (proceeds) sound; from this\nsound \u2018the drop\u2019; thence, the syllable Om; from this syllable, distinctively proceeds the mount Rama,\nthe abode of the Vaikhanasas. On that mount flourish manifold branches representing action and\nknowledge.\n21. The primal science of\nVedas three, reveals all sense;\n\nThey are the \u2018three\u2019, comprising\nRic, Yajus and Saman.\n22. Based on a fact, fourfold, they are called\nThe Ric, Yajus, Saman, Atharvan.\n23. The \u2018three\u2019 are so famed as they\nConcern the four priests, form texts\nOf triple sense, lingas, and much else.\nThe Atharvan is, in essence,\nRic, Yajus and Saman, too.\n24. Yet separated it is, being\nIn the main, of magic sense.\nThe Rig-Veda does flourish\nIn branches twenty-one.\n25. The Yajus is well known\nIn nine and hundred various schools.\nSaman has a thousand branches;\nThe Atharvan but forty.\n26. The Vaikhanasa philosophy\nWith intuition is concerned;\nWith Vaikhanasa it is that\nSages ever engage themselves.\n27. Rituals, Grammar, Phonetics, Etymology, Astronomy and Metre are the six limbs.\n28. The minor limbs are Vedanta\nAnd Mimamsa, the treatise on\nNyaya and Puranas upheld\nBy the knowers of the Law; so also\nOf meditation (upasana) the chapters;\n29. Ethics, of the Vedic lore all branches,\nTradition, Law upheld by Rishis great;\nHistory and legend \u2013 these the Upangas.\n30. The five minor Vedas are\nArchitecture and Archery,\nMusic, Medicine and Occult Thought (daivika).\n31. The Discipline, the Rites, the Gloss, the Lore,\nConquest supreme of breath \u2013 these twenty-one\nAre renowned as self-evident.\n32. The word of Vishnu at first sprang forth\nFrom Vaikhanasa as the Vedas three.\n33. As of old from sage Vaikhanasa\nThe \u2018three\u2019 sprang forth \u2013\nHear all from me.\nThe eternal Brahmic form is power to act.\n34. The manifest power is but the memory of the Lord; its essence is manifestation and evolution,\nrestriction and promotion, subsidence and upflaring. It is the cause of the patent and the latent,\npossessing all feet, limbs, faces, colours. It is at once different and non-different (from the Lord); the\nunfailing consort of the Lord, perpetually dependent on Him. She becomes patent and latent, and is\ncalled the manifest power because She is competent to bring about, through the (mere) closing and\nopening (of Her eye) creation, sustentation and retraction, suppression and promotion.\n35. The power of desire is threefold. At the time of retraction, for the sake of rest, when She rests on\n\nthe right side of the Lord\u2019s chest, in the shape of Srivatsa, She is the power of Yoga.\n36. The form of the Power of enjoyment is enjoyment. Associated with the Tree of Plenty, the wishgranting Cow, the wish-fulfilling Gem, and the nine Treasures such as the (precious) Conch and Lotus,\nShe is impelled by the devotion of the worshipper, whether sought or unsought (to yield enjoyments) as\na result of rites, compulsory or optional, like the Agnihotra; or as a result of (the eight \u2018limbs\u2019 of Yoga\npractice, namely) restraint, discipline, posture, control of breath, withdrawal, attention, meditation and\ncontemplation; or as a result of worship of the Lord\u2019s image in pinnacled temples; or as a result of\nceremonial baths, etc.; or of the worship of manes, etc.; or as a result of giving food, drink, etc., for\npleasing the Lord. (All this) is done (through the Power of enjoyment).\n37. Now the Power of heroism, four-armed, (is described). She indicates by her gestures fearlessness\nand (the granting of) boons; She bears the lotus; crowned and bedecked, She is surrounded by all the\ngods; is bathed, at the foot of the Tree of Plenty, by four elephants, in ambrosial waters from jewelled\npots. All divinities, Brahma and others, render obeisance to Her. She is vested with the eight miraculous\npowers such as becoming atomic in proportion; She is lauded by the wish-granting cow who is before\nHer; she is extolled by the Vedas, the Shastras, etc. Celestial nymphs like Jaya wait upon Her. The\nluminaries \u2013 the sun and the moon \u2013 shed splendour on Her. Tumburu, Narada and others sing of Her\nglory. The full moon and new moon days hold an umbrella over Her; two delightful beings hold the\nwhisks. Svaha and Svadha fan Her. Bhrigu and other supernatural beings adore Her. The Goddess\nLakshmi is seated on a divine Lion-Throne in the lotus posture, effectuating all causes and effects. The\nsteady (image of) the Lord\u2019s idea of differentiation, She beautifies. With tranquil eyes, adored by all the\ngods, She is known as the Beauty of Heroism. This is the Secret.\nOm ! Gods ! With ears let us hear what is good;\nAdorable ones ! With eyes let us see what is good.\nWith steady limbs, with bodies, praising,\nLet us enjoy the life allotted by the gods.\nMay Indra, of wide renown, grant us well-being;\nMay Pusan, and all-gods, grant us well-being.\nMay Tarksya, of unhampered movement, grant us well-being.\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being.\nOm !

Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nI would tell Yoga Chudamani Upanishad with a view to do good to yogis. This is being appreciated by\nthose elders who know Yoga well. This is secret and is capable of giving the post of salvation. 1\n[Slokas 2-29 are not available.]\nThe Jeevatma (the soul of the physical individual) is under the control of prana which goes up and\ndown as well as apana. Apana pulls Prana. Prana pulls Apana. He who knows and realizes this mutual\npull which is pulling to the top and bottom, understands yoga. 30\nIt goes outside with the sound \u201cha\u201d and goes again inside with the sound \u201csa\u201d. The beings keeping on\nchanting this mantra as \u201cHamsa\u201d, \u201cHamsa\u201d. 31\nThe beings always keep on chanting this mantra day and night twenty one thousand and one hundred\ntimes. 32\n\nThis mantra which is called \u201cAjapa Gayatri\u201d would give salvation to all yogis. Just a thought of this\nmantra, would help one get rid of all sins. 33\nThere are no practices as holy as this, no chanting which is equivalent to this, and no wisdom\nequivalent to this and in future also this is not likely to be there. 34\nThis Ajapa Gayatri which rises from the Kundalani supports the soul. This is the greatest among the\nsciences of the soul. He who knows this will know the Vedas. 35\nThe Kundalani power which is above the mooladhara, in its eight studded form would always be\ncovering the mouth of Sushumna which is the gate of Brahman. 36\nThe Kudalani Parameshwari (goddess of the universe) who should go through the disease less gate of\nBrahma, closes this gate with her mouth and sleeps. 37\nBecause of the heat generated by the practice of yoga, because of the speed of wind, and because of her\nmental power, she stands up and using her needle shaped body, she would go up through the Sushumna\nNadi. 38\nSimilar to opening the doors of the house by using the key, the yogi should open the gate to salvation\nusing Kundalini. 39\n[Slokas 40-71 are not available.]\nPara Brahman is Om, is that which exists, which is clean, which is full of wisdom, which does not have\nany draw backs, which is without stains, which cannot be described, which does not have beginning or\nend, which is one and only one, which is thuriya, which exists in things of past, present and future and\nwhich will never get divided at any time. From that Para Brahman emerges Para Shakthi (the female\naspect). That is the soul which is self resplendent. From that soul arose the ether. From ether arose\nwind. From wind arose fire. From fire arose water and from water arose the earth. These five elements\nare ruled by the five Godheads viz. Sadasiva, Easwara, Rudra, Vishnu and Brahma. Among them\nBrahma, Vishnu and Rudra would do the job of creation, upkeep and destruction. Brahma is Rajasic,\nVishnu Sathvic and Rudra Thamasic. They are thus with three different properties. 72.1\nAmong devas Brahma arose first. Among those who arose first, Brahma became the creator, Vishnu the\none who upkeeps and Lord Rudra, the destroyer. Among them from Brahma arose worlds, devas, men\nand those in between them. From him arose those things which do not move. In case of men, the body\nis the unified form of Pancha Boothas (five elements). The organs of wisdom, (jnanendriyas), the\norgans of action (karmendriyas), those activities related to wisdom, the five body airs (prana, apana etc)\nare taught by the macro portion of mind, intellect, decision making power and the feeling of self and\nare called macro body (Sthoola sareeram). The organs of wisdom, the organs of action, things related to\nwisdom, the five body airs and the micro aspect of mind and intellect are called Linga sareera. The\nbody has three types of properties. Thus all people have three bodies. There are four states of the body\nviz wakeful state, dream, sleep and Thuriya (exalted spiritual state). Those purushas who reside in our\nbody and control these states are Viswa, Thaijasa, Pragna and Atma. Viswa will always have macro\nexperiences. Different from that is Thaijasa who has micro experiences. Pragna has pleasant\nexperiences. Athma is a witness to all these. 72\nThe Atma which is of the form of \u201cOm\u201d, will be in all beings and at the time of passion, downward\n\nlooking. At all other times it would be pretty and downward face. 73\nIn the three letters Aa, Uu and Ma, three Vedas, three worlds, three characteristics, three letters and\nthree sounds shine. Thus Pranava shines. When you are awake, the letter Aa exists in the eyes of all\nbeings, when you are dreaming the letter Uu exists in the neck of all beings and the letter Ma exists in\nthe heart of all beings when they are asleep. 74\nThe letter Aa exists in the egg state as Viswa and Pinda state as Virat Purusha. The Letter Uu exists as\nThaijasa and Hiranya Garbha in the micro state. The letter Ma exists as the causal state and as Pragna.\nThe letter Aa has Rajasa qualities is red and its form is that of Lord Brahma. The letter Uu has Sathvika\nqualities and its form is that of white Vishnu. The letter Ma has Thamasic qualities and its form is that\nof black Rudra. Brahma took birth from Pranava. Vishnu also came out of it. Rudra also came out of it.\nPranava is the Para Brahma (ultimate god). Brahma merges with the letter Aa. Vishnu merges with\nletter Uu and Rudra merges with the letter Ma. In people with wisdom, Pranava would be upward\nlooking and among ignorant people Pranava would be looking downward. 75-78\nPranava exists like this. The one who knows this knows the Vedas. In the anahatha sound form, it\ngrows upwards in case of wise people. 79\nThe sound Pranava is continuous like the flow of oil, and like the long sound of the bell. Its peak is\nBrahman. 80\nThat peak would be lit so brilliantly, that it cannot be described by words. The great savants find it out\nusing their sharp intellect. The one who knows that, is considered as one who knows Vedas. 81\nThe \u201cHamsa (swan) mantra\u201d, shines in the middle of the two eyes. The letter Sa is known as Kechari\nwhich means \u201cthat which travels in the sky\u201d. It has been decided that it is the word \u201cTwam (you)\u201d in\nthe famous Vedic saying, \u201cTat Tvam Asi (You are That)\u201d. 82\nIt has been decided that the letter \u201cHa\u201d which is the Lord of all universe is the word \u201cTat (that)\u201d in the\nabove Vedic saying. We have to meditate that the letter \u201cSa\u201d as the soul traveling between birth and\ndeath and the letter \u201cHa\u201d as the stable God. 83\nThe living being is tied up by his organs but Paramatma is not so tied. The living being is egoistic and\nthe soul is not tied by egoism and is independent. 84\nThe ethereal light which is \u201com\u201d is that Athma in whose aspects stand the three worlds Bhu, Bhuva and\nSuva and also the place where three gods moon, Sun and fire reside. 85\nThe ethereal light which is \u201cOm\u201d, is that Atma in whose aspects stand \u201cwork\u201d which is the power of\nBrahma,\u201cdesire\u201d which is the power of Rudra and \u201cwisdom\u201d which is the power of Vishnu. 86\nBecause Om is the ethereal light, it has to be pronounced by words, practiced by the body and\nmeditated upon by the mind. 87\nThe one who goes on chanting Pranava whether he is clean or unclean will not be attached to the sins\nhe does, similar to the lotus leaf which never gets wet. 88\n[Slokas 89-102 are not available.]\n\nTwelve repetitions of \u201cOm\u201d which is called is a pooraka followed by sixteen repetitions of \u201cOm\u201d which\nis called is the Kumbhaka and then ten repetitions of \u201cOm\u201d which is called Rechaka, is called\nPranayama. 103\nThe basic rule for chanting Pranayama is at least 12 times and is termed as poor, twice that amount (24)\nis medium and thrice that (36) is Uthama (best). 104\nIn the lowest, there would be sweating, in the medium there would be trembling and in Uthama there is\nattainment of the objective. After that control the breath. 105\nThe Yogi should first salute his teacher and Lord Shiva and sit in the lotus posture, concentrate his sight\non the edge of the nose and practice pranayama alone. 106\n[Slokas 107-108 are not available.]\nBy posture one avoids diseases, by pranayama one avoids sins and by Pratyahara (see 120 below for\nexplanation) he controls his mental activity. 109\nBy beliefs, the mind becomes strong and Samadhi gives the being wonderful knowledge and he attains\nsalvation after destroying sinful and holy actions. 110\n[Slokas 111-112 are not available.]\nAfter seeing the Param Jyothi which is spread everywhere, in Samadhi duties and action neither come\nnor goes. 113\n[Slokas 114-115 are not available.]\nIf we stand together with Pranayama, all diseases would be destroyed. All diseases appear only to those\nwho are not able to do Pranayama. 116\n[Slokas 117-119 are not available.]\nPratyahara is the state where sensory organs like the eye do not concern themselves with things outside\nbut turn themselves inwards. 120\nSimilar to the Sun taking his rays inwards at the third period of dusk, the yogi who is in the third stage\nwould control his mind. 121\nOm ! Let my limbs and speech, Prana, eyes, ears, vitality\nAnd all the senses grow in strength.\nAll existence is the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nMay I never deny Brahman, nor Brahman deny me.\nLet there be no denial at all:\nLet there be no denial at least from me.\nMay the virtues that are proclaimed in the Upanishads be in me,\nWho am devoted to the Atman; may they reside in me.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\n\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Yoga-Chudamani Upanishad, included in the Sama-Veda.",

The mendicant monks who wear marks of renunciation inwardly. [They are the ascetics entitled to\nstudy this Upanishad.]\n4. (They are) the protectors of the field in which I-ness (indicative of the separateness of the Self) is\ndestroyed.\n5. Their settled conclusion is partless like ether.\n6. (Their heart) is the river of immortal waves.\n7. (Their heart) is imperishable and unconditioned.\n8. (Their preceptor) is the (realized) sage free from doubts.\n9. The divine being (they adore is) final beatitude.\n\n10. Their activity is free of family (and other) ties.\n11. Their knowledge is not isolated.\n12. (They study and/or teach) the higher scripture.\n13. (They constitute) the propless monastic centre.\n14. Their dedication (is to reveal Brahman) to a group (of worthy disciples).\n15. The instruction is the non-existence (of things other than Brahman).\n16. This dedication brings joy and purification (to the disciples).\n17. Their sight is (like) seeing the twelve suns.\n18. Discrimination (of the real from the unreal) is (their) protection.\n19. Their compassion aloe is the sport.\n20. (They wear) the garland of bliss.\n21. In the cave of one seat (is) their audience of happiness, free from restrictions of yoga-postures.\n22. (They) subsist on food not prepared (specially for them).\n23. Their conduct is in consonance with the realization of the oneness of the Self and Brahman\n(Hamsa).\n24. They demonstrate to disciples (by their conduct) that Brahman is present in all beings.\n25. True conviction is their patched garment. Non-alignment is their loin-cloth. Reflection (of the truths\nof the Vedanta) is their (emblematic-)staff. The vision of Brahman (as non-different from the Self) is\ntheir yoga-cloth. Sandals (consist in avoiding contact with worldly) wealth. Activity (for bare living) at\nthe behest of others. Their bondage (is only in the desire to direct) the Kundalini (into the Susumna).\nLiberated while alive, as they are freed from denial of the highest (Brahman). The oneness with Siva is\ntheir sleep. True knowledge (by denying joy in Avidya) or the Khechari-mudra is their supreme bliss.\n26. The (bliss of) Brahman is free from the (three) qualities (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas).\n27. (Brahman) is realized by discrimination (of the real from the unreal) (and) it is beyond the reach of\nthe mind and speech.\n28. The phenomenal world is impermanent as it is produced (from Brahman which alone is real); it is\nsimilar to a world seen in a dream and an elephant in the sky (i.e. illusory): similarly the cluster of\nthings such as the body is perceived by a network of a multitude of delusions and it is fancied to exist\nas a serpent in a rope (due to imperfect knowledge).\n29. The (worship of) gods named Vishnu, Brahma and a hundred others culminates (in Brahman).\n30. The goad is the path.\n31. (The path) is not void, only conventional.\n32. The strength of the supreme Lord (is the support to the aerial path).\n33. The Yoga accomplished by truth is the monastery.\n34. The position (heaven) of gods does not constitute its real nature.\n35. The prime source Brahman is self-realization.\n36. (The ascetic) shall meditate on the absence of distinction, based on the Gayatri through the Ajapa\nMantra.\n37. Restraint on the mind is the patched garment.\n38. By Yoga (there is) the vision (experience) of the nature of everlasting bliss.\n39. Bliss is the alms that he enjoys.\n40. Residence even in the great cemetery is as in a pleasure garden.\n41. A solitary place is the monastery.\n42. Complete quiescence of the mind is the practice of Brahmavidya.\n43. His movement is to unmani state.\n44. His pure body is the propless seat of dignity.\n45. His activity is the bliss of the waves of immortality.\n46. The ether of consciousness is the great established conclusion.\n47. Instruction in the emancipating mantra results in efficiency of bodily limbs and mind for possessing\n\ndivine power in practising tranquillity, self-restraint, etc., and in the realization of the oneness of the\n(so-called) higher and lower Self.\n48. The presiding deity (of the Taraka) is the everlasting bliss of non-duality.\n49. The voluntary religious observance is the restraint of the inner senses.\n50. Renouncing (tyaga) is the giving up of fear, delusion, sorrow and anger.\n51. (Renouncing results is) the enjoyment of bliss in the identity of the higher and lower (self).\n52. Unrestrainedness is pure power.\n53. When the reality of Brahman shines in the self there is the annihilation of the phenomenal world\nwhich is enveloped by the power of Shiva (Maya); similarly the burning of the existence or nonexistence of the aggregate of the causal, subtle and gross bodies.\n54. He realizes Brahman as the prop of the ether.\n55. The auspicious fourth state is the sacred thread; the tuft (too) consists of that.\n56. (To him) the created world consists of consciousness; (so also) the immovable and the group of\nvarious beings.\n57. Uprooting (the effect of) karman is (mere) talk; in the cemetery (Self-Brahman), illusion, \u2018mineness\u2019 and ego have been burnt.\n58. (The realized Parivrajaka) has his body intact.\n59. Meditation on the true form which is beyond the three attributes (of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas);\n(even this) condition (of distinction \u2018I am Brahman\u2019) is a delusion which shall be annihilated The\nburning of the attitude of passion, etc., (ought to be done). The loin cloth ought to be rough and tight\n(so that the vital energy moves upward in perpetual celibacy). Deer-skin garment for long (and later to\nbe unclad). The unstruck mantra (the Om in the fourth state turiya) is practised by refraining from\n(worldly) action. Conducting himself freely (as he has reached a stage which is beyond good and bad,\nhe realizes) his true nature which is liberation.\n60. His conduct (of serving a primary Avadhuta) as a ship (to cross the ocean of worldly life and) reach\nthe transcendent Brahman; practising celibacy till tranquillity is attained; getting instruction in the stage\nof a celibate student, or learning (the truth) in the stage of a dweller in the forest (Vanaprastha) he\n(embraces) renunciation wherein all (true) knowledge is established; at the end he becomes of the form\nof the indivisible Brahman, the eternal, the annihilator of all doubts.\n61. This Nirvanopanishad (the secret doctrine leading to final beatitude) shall not be imparted to one\nother than a disciple or a son. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm !

    "Mandalabrahmana": "\nMandala Brahmana Upanishad\nTranslated by K. Narayanasvami Aiyar\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nBRAHMANA - I\n1. OM. The great Muni Yajnavalkya went to Aditya-Loka (the sun\u2019s world) and saluting him (the\nPurusha of the Sun) said: \u201cO Revered Sir, describe to me the Atman-Tattva (the Tattva or Truth of\nAtman).\u201d (To which) Narayana (viz., the Purusha of the sun) replied: \u201cI shall describe the eight-fold\nYoga together with Jnana. The conquering of cold and heat as well as hunger and sleep, the preserving\nof (sweet) patience and unruffledness ever and the restraining of the organs (from sensual objects) \u2013 all\nthese come under (or are) Yama. Devotion to one\u2019s Guru, love of the true path, enjoyment of objects\nproducing happiness, internal satisfaction, freedom from association, living in a retired place, the\ncontrolling of the Manas and the not longing after the fruits of actions and a state of Vairagya \u2013 all\nthese constitute Niyama. The sitting in any posture pleasant to one and clothed in tatters (or bark) is\nprescribed for Asana (posture). Inspiration, restraint of breath and expiration, which have respectively\n16, 64 and 32 (Matras) constitute Pranayama (restraint of breath). The restraining of the mind from the\nobjects of senses is Pratyahara (subjugation of the senses). The contemplation of the oneness of\nconsciousness in all objects is Dhyana. The mind having been drawn away from the objects of the\nsenses, the fixing of the Chaitanya (consciousness) (on one alone) is Dharana. The forgetting of oneself\nin Dhyana is Samadhi. He who thus knows the eight subtle parts of Yoga attains salvation.\n2. The body has five stains (viz.,) passion, anger, out-breathing, fear and sleep. The removal of these\ncan be affected respectively by absence of Sankalpa, forgiveness, moderate food, carefulness and a\nspiritual sight of Tattvas. In order to cross the ocean of Samsara where sleep and fear are the serpents,\ninjury, etc., are the waves, Trishna (thirst) is the whirlpool and wife is the mire, one should adhere to\n\nthe subtle path and overstepping Tattva and other Gunas should look out for Taraka. Taraka is Brahman\nwhich being in the middle of the two eyebrows, is of the nature of the spiritual effulgence of\nSachchidananda. The (spiritual) seeing through the three Lakshyas (or the three kinds of introvision) is\nthe means to It (Brahman). Susumna which is from the Muladhara to Brahmarandhra has the radiance\nof the sun. In the centre of it, is Kundalini shining like Crores of lightning and subtle as the thread in\nthe lotus-stalk. Tamas is destroyed there. Through seeing it, all sins are destroyed. When the two ears\nare closed by the tips of the forefingers, a Phutkara (or booming) sound is heard. When the mind is\nfixed on it, it sees a blue light between the eyes as also in the heart. (This is Antar-Lakshya or internal\nintrovision). In the Bahir-Lakshya (or external introvision) one sees in order before his nose at distance\nof 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 digits, the space of blue colour, then a colour resembling Shyama (indigo-black)\nand then shining as Rakta (red) wave and then with the two Pita (yellow and orange red) colours. Then\nhe is a Yogin. When one looks at the external space, moving the eyes and sees streaks of light at the\ncorners of his eyes, then his vision can be made steady. When one sees Jyotis (spiritual light) above his\nhead 12 digits in length, then he attains the state of nectar. In the Madhya-Lakshya (or the middle one),\none sees the variegated colours of the morning as if the sun, the moon and the fire had joined together\nin the Akasa that is without them. Then he comes to have their nature (of light). Through practice, he\nbecomes one with Akasa, devoid of all Gunas and peculiarities. At first Akasa with its shining stars\nbecomes to him Para-Akasa as dark as Tamas itself and he becomes one with Para-Akasa shining with\nstars and deep as Tamas. (Then) he becomes one with Maha-Akasa resplendent (as) with the fire of the\ndeluge. Then he becomes one with Tattva-Akasa, lighted with the brightness which is the highest and\nthe best of all. Then he becomes one with Surya-Akasa (Sun-Akasa) brightened by a Crore of suns. By\npractising thus, he becomes one with them. He who knows them becomes thus.\n3. Know that Yoga is twofold through its division into the Purva (earlier) and the Uttara (later). The\nearlier is Taraka and the later is Amanaska (the mindless). Taraka is divided into Murti (with limitation)\nand Amurti (without limitation). That is Murti Taraka which goes to the end of the senses (or exist till\nthe senses are conquered). That is Amurti Taraka which goes beyond the two eyebrows (above the\nsenses). Both these should be performed through Manas. Antar-Drishti (internal vision) associated with\nmanas comes to aid Taraka. Tejas (spiritual light) appears in the hole between the two eyebrows. This\nTaraka is the earlier one. The later is Amanaska. The great Jyotis (light) is above the root of the palate.\nBy seeing it, one gets the Siddhis Anima, etc. Sambhavi-Mudra occurs when the Lakshya (spiritual\nvision) is internal while the (physical) eyes are seeing externally without winking. This is the great\nscience which is concealed in all the Tantras. When this is known, one does not stay in Samsara. Its\nworship (or practice) gives salvation. Antar-Lakshya is of the nature of Jala-Jyotis (or water-Jyotis). It\nis known by the great Rishis and is invisible both to the internal and external senses.\n4. Sahasrara (viz., the thousand-petalled lotus of the pineal gland) Jala-Jyotis is the Antar-Lakshya.\nSome say the form of Purusha in the cave of Buddhi beautiful in all its parts is Antar-Lakshya. Some\nagain say that the all-quiescent Nilakantha accompanied by Uma (his wife) and having five months and\nlatent in the midst of the sphere in the brain is Antar-Lakshya. Whilst others say that the Purusha of the\ndimension of a thumb is Antar-Lakshya. A few again say Antar-Lakshya is the One Self made supreme\nthrough introvision in the state of a Jivanmukta. All the different statements above made pertain to\nAtman alone. He alone is a Brahma-Nishtha who sees that the above Lakshya is the pure Atman. The\nJiva which is the twenty-fifth Tattva, having abandoned the twenty-four Tattvas, becomes a Jivanmukta\nthrough the conviction that the twenty-sixth Tattva (viz.,) Paramatman is \u2018I\u2019 alone. Becoming one with\nAntar-Lakshya (Brahman) in the emancipated state by means of Antar-Lakshya (introvision), Jiva\nbecomes one with the partless sphere of Param-Akasa.\nThus ends the first Brahmana.\nBRAHMANA - II\n1. Then Yajnavalkya asked the Purusha in the sphere of the sun: \u201cO Lord, Antar-Lakshya has been\n\ndescribed many times, but it has never been understood by me (clearly). Pray describe it to me\u201d. He\nreplied: \u201cIt is the source of the five elements, has the lustre of many (streaks of) lightning and has four\nseats having (or rising from) \u2018That\u2019 (Brahman). In its midst, there arises the manifestation of Tattva. It\nis very hidden and Unmanifested. It can be known (only) by one who has got into the boat of Jnana. It\nis the object of both Bahir and Antar (external and internal) Lakshyas. In its midst is absorbed the\nwhole world. It is the vast partless universe beyond Nada, Bindu and Kala. Above it (viz., the sphere of\nAgni) is the sphere of the sun; in its midst is the sphere of the nectary moon; in its midst is the sphere\nof the partless Brahma-Tejas (or the spiritual effulgence of Brahman). It has the brightness of Sukla\n(white light) like the ray of lightning. It alone has the characteristic of Sambhavi. In seeing this there\nare three kinds of Drishti (sight), viz., Ama (the new moon), Pratipat (the first day of lunar fortnight)\nand Purnima (the full moon). The sight of Ama is the one (seen) with closed eyes. That with half\nopened eyes is Pratipat; while that with fully opened eyes is Purnima. Of these, the practice of Purnima\nshould be resorted to. Its Lakshya (or aim) is the tip of the nose. Then is seen a deep darkness at the\nroot of the palate. By practising thus, a Jyotis (light) of the form of an endless sphere is seen. This\nalone is Brahman, the Sachchidananda. When the mind is absorbed in bliss thus naturally produced,\nthen does Sambhavi takes place. She (Sambhavi) alone is called Khechari. By practising it (viz., the\nMudra), a man obtains firmness of mind. Through it, he obtains firmness of Vayu. The following are\nthe signs: first it is seen like a star; then a reflecting (or dazzling) diamond; then the sphere of full\nmoon; then the sphere of the brightness of nine gems; then the sphere of the midday sun; then the\nsphere of the flame of Agni (fire); all these are seen in order.\n2. (Thus much for the light in Purva or first stage.) Then there is the light in the western direction (in\nthe Uttara or second stage). Then the lustres of crystal, smoke, Bindu, Nada, Kala, star, firefly, lamp,\neye, gold and nine gems, etc., are seen. This alone is the form of Pranava. Having united Prana and\nApana and holding the breath in Kumbhaka, one should fix his concentration at the tip of his nose and\nmaking Shanmukhi with the fingers of both his hands, one hears the sound of Pranava (Om) in which\nManas becomes absorbed. Such a man has not even the touch of Karma. The karma of (SandhyaVandana or the daily prayers) is verily performed at the rising or setting of the sun. As there is no rising\nor setting (but only the ever shining) of the sun of Chit (the higher consciousness) in the heart of a man\nwho knows thus, he has no Karma to perform. Rising above (the conception of) day and night through\nthe annihilation of sound and time, he becomes one with Brahman through the all-full Jnana and the\nattaining of the state of Unmani (the state above Manas). Through the state of Unmani, he becomes\nAmanaska (or without Manas).\nNot being troubled by any thoughts (of the world) then constitutes the Dhyana. The abandoning of all\nKarmas constitutes Avahana (invocation of god). Being firm in the unshaken (spiritual) wisdom\nconstitutes Asana (posture). Being in the state of Unmani constitutes the Padya (offering of water for\nwashing the feet of god). Preserving the state of Amanaska (when Manas is offered as sacrifice)\nconstitutes the Arghya (offering of water as oblation generally). Being in state of eternal brightness and\nshoreless nectar constitutes Snana (bathing). The contemplation of Atman as present in all constitutes\n(the application to the idol of) Sandal. The remaining in the real state of the Drik (spiritual eye) is (the\nworshipping with) Akshata (non-broken rice). The attaining of Chit (consciousness) is (the worshipping\nwith) flower. The real state of Agni (fire) of Chit is the Dhupa (burning of incense). The state of the sun\nof Chit is the Dipa (light waved before the image). The union of one-self with the nectar of full moon is\nthe Naivedya (offering of food, etc.,). The immobility in that state (of the ego being one with all) is\nPradakshina (going round the image). The conception of \u2018I am He\u2019 is Namaskara (prostration). The\nsilence (then) is the Sruti (praise). The all-contentment (or serenity then) is the Visatjana (giving leave\nto god or finishing worship). (This is the worship of Atman by all raja-Yogins). He who knows this\nknows all.\n3. When the Triputi are thus dispelled, he becomes the Kaivalya Jyotis without Bhava (existence) or\nAbhava (non-existence), full and motionless, like the ocean without the tides or like the lamp without\n\nthe wind. He becomes a Brahmavit (knower of Brahman) by cognising the end of the sleeping state\neven while in the waking state. Though the (same) mind is absorbed in Sushupti as also in Samadhi,\nthere is much difference between them. (in the former case) as the mind is absorbed in Tamas, it does\nnot become the means of salvation, (but) in Samadhi as the modifications of Tamas in him are rooted\naway, the mind raises itself to the nature of the Partless. All that is no other than Sakshi-Chaitanya\n(wisdom-consciousness or the Higher Self) into which the absorption of the whole universe takes place,\nin as much as the universe is but a delusion (or creation) of the mind and is therefore not different from\nit. Though the universe appears perhaps as outside of the mind, still it is unreal. He who knows\nBrahman and who is the sole enjoyer of Brahmic bliss which is eternal and has dawned once (for all in\nhim) \u2013 that man becomes one with Brahman. He in whom Sankalpa perishes has got Mukti in his hand.\nTherefore one becomes an emancipated person through the contemplation of Paramatman. Having\ngiven up both Bhava and Abhava, one becomes a Jivanmukta by leaving off again and again in all\nstates Jnana (wisdom) and Jneya (object of wisdom), Dhyana (meditation) and Dhyeya (object of\nmeditation), Lakshya (the aim) and Alakshya (non-aim), Drishya (the visible) and Adrishya (the nonvisible) and Uha (reasoning) and Apoha (negative reasoning). He who knows this knows all.\n4. There are five Avasthas (states): Jagrat (waking), Swapna (dreaming), Sushupti (dreamless sleeping),\nthe Turya (fourth) and Turyatita (that beyond the fourth). The Jiva (ego) that is engaged in the waking\nstate becomes attached to the Pravritti (worldly) path and is the particular of Naraka (hell) as the fruit\nof sins. He desires Svarga (heaven) as the fruit of his virtuous actions. This very same person becomes\n(afterwards) indifferent to all these saying, \u2018Enough of the births tending to actions, the fruits of which\ntend to bondage till the end of this mundane existence\u2019. Then he pursues the Nivritti (return) path with\na view to attain emancipation. And this person then takes refuge in a spiritual instructor in order to\ncross this mundane existence. Giving up passion and others, he does only those he is asked to do. Then\nhaving acquired the four Sadhanas (means to salvation) he attains, in the middle of the lotus of his\nheart, the Reality of Antar-Lakshya that is but the Sat of Lord and begins to recognise (or recollect) the\nbliss of Brahman which he had left (or enjoyed) in his Sushupti state. At last he attains this state of\ndiscrimination (thus): \u2018I think I am the non-dual One only. I was in Ajnana for some time (in the\nwaking state and called therefore Vishva). I became somehow (or involuntarily) a Taijasa (in the\ndreaming state) through the reflection (in that state) of the affinities of the forgotten waking state; and\nnow I am a Prajna through the disappearance of those two states. Therefore I am one only. I (appear) as\nmore than one through the differences of state and place. And there is nothing of differentiation of class\nbesides me\u2019. Having expelled even the smack of the difference (of conception) between \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018That\u2019\nthrough the thought \u2018I am the pure and the secondless Brahman\u2019 and having attained the path of\nsalvation which is of the nature of Para-Brahman, after having become one with It through the Dhyana\nof the sun\u2019s sphere as shining with himself, he becomes fully ripened for getting salvation. Sankalpa\nand others are the causes of the bondage of the mind; and the mind devoid of these becomes fit for\nsalvation. Possessing such a mind free from all (Sankalpa, etc.,) and withdrawing himself from the\nouter world of sight and others and so keeping himself out of the odour of the universe, he looks upon\nall the world as Atman, abandons the conception of \u2018I\u2019, thinks \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 and considers all these\nas Atman. Through these, he becomes one who has done his duty.\n5. The Yogin is one that has realised Brahman that is all-full beyond Turya. They (the people) extol him\nas Brahman; and becoming the object of the praise of the whole world, he wanders over different\ncountries. Placing the Bindu in the Akasa of Paramatman and pursuing the path of the partless bliss\nproduced by the pure, secondless, stainless and innate Yoga sleep of Amanaska, he becomes an\nemancipated person. Then the Yogin becomes immersed in the ocean of bliss. When compared to it, the\nbliss of Indra and others is very little. He who gets this bliss is the supreme Yogin.\nThus ends the second Brahmana.\nBRAHMANA - III\n\n1. The great sage Yajnavalkya then asked the Purusha in the sphere (of the sun): \u201cO Lord, though the\nnature of Amanaska has been defined (by you), yet I forget it (or do not understand it clearly).\nTherefore pray explain it again to me.\u201d Accordingly the Purusha said: \u201cThis Amanaska is a great secret.\nBy knowing this, one becomes a person who had done his duty. One should look upon it as\nParamatman, associated with Sambhavi-Mudra and should know also all those that can be known\nthrough a (thorough) cognition of them. Then seeing Para-Brahman in his own Atman as the Lord of\nall, the immeasurable, the birthless, the auspicious, the supreme Akasa, the supportless, the secondless\nthe only goal of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra and the cause of all and assuring himself that he who plays\nin the cave (of the heart) is such a one, he should raise himself above the dualities of existence and nonexistence; and knowing the experience of the Unmani of his Mans, he then attains the state of ParaBrahman which is motionless as a lamp in a windless place, having reached the ocean of Brahmic bliss\nby means of the river of Amanaska-Yoga through the destruction of all his senses. Then he resembles a\ndry tree. Having lost all (idea of) the universe through the disappearance of growth, sleep, disease,\nexpiration and inspiration, his body being always steady, he comes to have a supreme quiescence, being\ndevoid of the movements of his Manas and becomes absorbed in Paramatman. The destruction of mans\ntakes place after the destruction of the collective senses, like the cow\u2019s udder (that shrivels up) after the\nmilk has been drawn. It is this that is Amanaska. By following this, one becomes always pure and\nbecomes one that has done his duty, having been filled with the partless bliss by means of the path of\nTaraka-Yoga through the initiation into the sacred sentences \u2018I am pa\u2019, 'That Thou Art', \u2018I am thou\nalone\u2019, \u2018Thou art I alone\u2019, etc.\n2. When his Mans is immersed in the Akasa and he becomes all-full and when he attains the Unmani\nstate, having abandoned all his collective senses, he conquers all sorrows and impurities through the\npartless bliss, having attained the fruits of Kaivalya, ripened through the collective merits gathered in\nall his previous lives and thinking always \u2018I am Brahman\u2019, becomes one that has done his duty. \u2018I am\nThou alone. There is no difference between thee and me owing to the fullness of Paramatman\u2019.\u201d Saying\nthus, he (the Purusha of the sun) embraced his pupil and made him understand it.\nThus ends the third Brahmana.\nBRAHMANA - IV\nThen Yajnavalkya addressed the Purusha in the sphere (of the sun) thus: \u201cPray explain to me in detail\nthe nature of the five-fold division of Akasa\u201d. He replied: \u201cThere are five: Akasa, Parakasa, Mahakasa,\nSuryakasa and Paramakasa. That which is of the nature of darkness, both in and out is the first Akasa.\nThat which has the fire of deluge, both in and out is truly Mahakasa. That which has the brightness of\nthe sun, both in and out is Suryakasa. That brightness which is indestructible, all-pervading and of the\nnature of unrivalled bliss is Paramakasa. By cognising these according to this description, one becomes\nof their nature.\nHe is a Yogin only in name, who does not cognise well the nine Chakras, the six Adharas, the three\nLakshyas and the five Akasa.\nThus ends the fourth Brahmana.\nBRAHMANA - V\n\u201cThe Manas influenced by worldly objects is liable to bondage; and that (Mans) which is not so\ninfluenced by these is fit for salvation. Hence all the world becomes an object of Chitta; whereas the\nsame Chitta when it is supportless and well-ripe in the state of Unmani, becomes worthy of Laya\n(absorption in Brahman). This absorption you should learn from me who am the all-full. I alone am the\ncause of the absorption of Manas.\nThe Mans is within the Jyotis (spiritual light) which again is latent in the spiritual sound which pertains\nto the Anahata (heart) sound.\nThat Manas which is the agent of creation, preservation and destruction of the three worlds \u2013 that same\n\nManas becomes absorbed in that which is the highest seat of Vishnu;\nThrough such an absorption, one gets the pure and secondless state, owing to the absence of difference\nthen. This alone is the highest truth. He who knows this, will wander in the world like a lad or an idiot\nor a demon or simpleton. By practising this Amanaska, one is ever contented, his urine and faeces\nbecome diminished, his food becomes lessened; he becomes strong in body and his limbs are free from\ndisease and sleep. Then his breath and eyes being motionless, he realises Brahman and attains the\nnature of bliss. That ascetic who is intent on drinking the nectar of Brahman produced by the long\npractice of this kind of Samadhi, becomes a Paramahamsa (ascetic) or an Avadhuta (naked ascetic). By\nseeing him, all the world becomes pure and even an illiterate person who serves him is freed from\nbondage. He (the ascetic) enables the members of his family for one hundred and one generations to\ncross the ocean of Samsara; and his mother, father, wife and children \u2013 all these are similarly freed.\nThus is the Upanishad.\u201d\nThus ends the fifth Brahmana.\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm !

In Brahma Vartha (Land of Brahma), under a banyan tree called Maha Bandira, many sages\nincluding Sounaka had assembled to perform a Sathra fire sacrifice. They approached sage Markandeya\nwearing samiths (dried twigs of banyan tree) as gloves and asked him, \u201cHow do you manage to be a\nChiram Jeevi (One who does not have death) and how are you always in the happy state?\" 1\nHe replied, \u201cThis is because of the knowledge of the most secret philosophy of Shiva. This very secret\nShiva philosophy by which Shiva who is the Dakshinamurthy, becomes some thing which is not visible\nto others. He is that God who at the time of final deluge, who keeps every thing else within himself and\nshines because of the pleasure of his own spirit. The secret mantras about him are as follows: Brahma\nis the sage, the meter is Gayathri and the god is Dakshinamurhy for this mantra.\nFirst Mantra of 24 letters: After telling \u201com\u201d, tell \u201cNamo\u201d and then \u201cBhagavathe Dakshinamurthaye\u201d,\nthen the fourth form of \u201casmad\u201d viz \u201cMahyam\u201d, then \u201cmedham Pragnam\u201d, then the root of wind \u201cya\u201d,\nadded with \u201cchcha\u201d, followed by the name of wife of fire God \u201cswaha\u201d. This is the mantra with 24\nletters. That is \u201cOm Namo Bhagwathe Dakshinamurthaye Mahyam, Medham Pragnam Prayacha\nSwaha!\u201d 2\nThen Dhyanam (thinking abut the form in the mind, when mantra is chanted). I salute him who is white\nlike a crystal, who holds in his hands, a chain of pearl beads, the pot of nectar which is the form of\n\nknowledge, and the mudhra (symbol) of wisdom, who ties himself with a snake, who wears the moon\non his head and who wears different type of ornaments. 3\nSecond Mantra of nine letters: First Say \u201cOm\u201d, then the first vowel with the visarga and in the end ell\nPanchakshari with visarga in the end, and this gives the Navakshari mantra (nine letters mantra). That\nis \u201cOm Aam Aa Sivaya Nama Om!\u201d 4\nThen Dhyanam. Let the three eyed god who does only good, who has in his three hands, the sign of\nprotection, deer and axe in three hands and fourth hand kept on his knee, who has tied a snake on his\nbody, who shines white like milk, who sits below a banyan tree and who is surrounded by sages like\nShuka, gives us pure thoughts. 5\n[Slokas 6 is not available.]\nThird Mantra: Add Broom Nama, Maya Bheeja, Vagbhava Bheeja, Dakshinamurthaye and Jnanam dehi\nSwaha to Om. The mantra would be \u201cOm Broom, Namo Hreem Im Dakshinamurthaye Jnanam Dehi\nSwaha!\u201d 7\nThen Dhyanam: Let the God Dakshinamurthy, who has a white body due to application of holy ash,\nwho wears the crescent moon on his head, who holds in his hands, Jnana mudra (symbol of wisdom),\nbeaded chain, Veena and books, who wears all ornaments, who wears the elephant hide, who resembles\nthe meditating Rama, who sits on the throne of explanation and who is being served by great sages\nprotect us always. 8\nWe have to see that lamp of wisdom, which burns with renunciation as oil, devotion as wick and which\nshines in the full vessel of wake up state. 9\nIn the beginning of creation, Lord Brahma prayed this Dakshinamurthy, and obtained the capacity of\ncreating beings and became very happy. He became blessed after getting what he desired. That Brahma\ntherefore has become a devotee as well as somebody who deserves our devotion. 10\nThe one who reads this philosophy of Shiva with understanding, would get rid of all his sins. The ones\nwho know this truly will attain salvation. 11\nOm !

Shanti!\nI am now going to explain the principles behind the \u201ctripat-narayana\u201d philosophy, which, if understood\nand grasped fully, can cull out and weed all forms of illusory material that surrounds all living in this\nmaterialistic world.\n\u201cOM! The Supreme Being, known as Narayana, desired to create living beings. And out of such desire\n(or vow), the living force of breath called \u201cprana\u201d stems out from the Supreme Being; the mind\n(manas) and all other sense organs come into being. Also created along with are the Sky, the Air, the\nLight, the Water and the Earth, which bears all the beings. Out of Narayana arises the Brahma, the deity\nwho is the creator of all beings; and also the Indra, who is the ruler of all Devas. Out of Him comes\nPrajapati, the deity who originates and controls the people, as well as the twelve Adityas, eleven Rudras\nand eight Vasus (various controlling forces mentioned in the Vedas \u2013 each concerning a distinct and\ndifferent force of nature). It is only out of the same Narayana that all Vedas came into existence. Thus,\nall forces come out of Narayana and also finally merge into Him.\u201d \u2013 Thus proclaims one of the\nUpanishads in the Rig Veda.\n\u201cNarayanan is ever-present and eternal; He is omnipotent and omnipresent; Brahma, Siva, Indra, all\n\n(these deities) are (various forms of) Narayana himself. He indeed, is all forms of time, space and\ndirection. All directions of up, down, sides, in and out are His shadow-cast. All that is existing and the\nones to come into existence are Narayana Himself. The Single Supreme Being, devoid of any form of\nimpurity, which cannot be expressed in words, and which is the purest of all pure, is Narayanan. There\nis nothing above Him and no second power than His. That one who understands this as such becomes\n(merges with) the Narayana Himself; he becomes (merges with) the Narayana Himself (repeated\nstress).\u201d \u2013 Thus asserts one of the Upanishads in the Yajur Veda.\n\u201cFirst utter the syllable \u201cOM\u201d; then utter the words \u201cNamah\u201d and \u201cNarayanaya\u201d. These words\nrespectively are made of one, two and five syllables (as in Sanskrit); thus the entire phrase is made of\neight syllables or called as \u201cashta-aksharam\u201d (ashta-eight; aksharam-syllable). That one who chants this\neight-syallable mantra of Narayana, lives long without any disrepute or notoriety; he is blessed with\nrulership, wealth, cattle and servants and ultimately attains the moksha (or the point of no return) also\ncalled as salvation; he attains the moksha (repeated with stress).\u201d \u2013 Thus states one of the Upanishads\nin the Sama Veda.\n\u201cThat blissful Supreme Being (Brahman) which resides within, is of the form of OM or Pranava. The\nPranava (OM) is made of A, U and M. That grew in multiples. The blessed one, who recites and chants\nthe syllable OM, he gets rid of all the bindings and bonds of this material world. The one who chants\nthe words \u201cOm Namo Narayanaya\u201d ultimately attains the Vaikunda, the abode of Sri Narayana (or the\nHeaven \u2013 the Home of Salvation). The Vaikunda is not (to be found) anywhere else but in a pure\nblessed heart, filled with knowledge (spiritual). From there rises an offshoot of light, as bright as a ray\nof lightning. That ray of light is representative of the various forms of Narayana \u2013 called by names such\nas son of Devaki, the one sweeter than Honey, the one in the form of Brahma, the one with lotus-like\neyes, Vishnu (or the savior of all). He resides within all beings, and controls all their activities. He is\nthe form of non-materialistic syllable OM, the Supreme Being.\u201d \u2013 Thus states one of the Upanishads in\nthe Atharva Veda.\n(Having thus known what each of the four Vedas say about Narayana, now let us understand the fruits\nof chanting His mantra). That one who chants this (mantra) in the morning, destroys all (his) sins\ncommitted during the (previous) night. The one who chants this in the evening destroys all sins\ncommitted during the day. That one who chants this during mid-day, looking at the Sun, destroys all the\nfive kinds of major and minor sins described as the worst in the Scriptures. He gets all the benefits of\nhaving chanted all the Vedas. Ultimately, he merges into and becomes one with the Supreme Being\nNarayana.\nOM! May Brahman protect us (the Guru and Sishya) both!

Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nThat which helps you cross from the fear of birth, aging and death is called Tharakam (Tharayathi\nmeans Crosses). Understanding the appearance of the living being and God as separate entities is due to\nillusion and then examining and understanding the differences which exist in the world by the method\nof, \u201cIt is not this\u201d, \u201cIt is not this\u201d and at last what remains at last is the Adhvaya Brahman (which does\nnot have two forms). To get it we have to practice three aims. 1\nIn the middle of body there exists the Sushumna Nadi which is as bright as the sun and as cool as the\nmoon. It starts from Mooladhara and goes up to Brahmarandra which is in the top middle of the skull.\nIt is well known that in the middle of it there exists Kundalani which is as bright as crores of suns and\nas thin as the lotus thread. The man who sees that with his mind\u2019s eye attains salvation by getting rid of\nall sins. 2\nOne who sees constant light in the top portion of his, in the middle of his forehead has attained mastery\nof yoga. 3\nWherever it is, if there is light above the head of a one, he is a yogi. 4\nThe yoga within is of two types viz Poorva (pre) and Uthara (post). The pre yoga is tharaka and the\npost yoga is amanaska (beyond mind). 5\n\nThat which can be realized by sensory organs is one which has a form. That which is in between the\neye lids is without form. Always for understanding the things within, practice with deep application of\nmind is necessary. In Tharaka yoga, the concepts like Daharakasa are understood only by the mind\u2019s\neye. The Uthara (post) yoga is without form. It is beyond the mind. 6\nWithout batting the eye lids to see inside and outside, what we are aiming to see is called Sambhavi\nMudra. The place where an expert in that type of mudra lives becomes very holy. 7\nBy the help of a great teacher one tries to find the Thuriya state hidden in either the sahasrara (thousand\npetal lotus) or the cave of the heart or end of the 12 Nadis. Ability to see it is only through the help of a\ngreat teacher. 8\nIf the teacher, who is a scholar in Vedas, who is a devotee of Lord Vishnu, who does not have jealousy\nin his mind, who is a great expert in yoga, who practices Yoga and who is the personification of Yoga\nblesses us, all the ties imposed by birth will vanish. At that moment all the sins committed in all the\nbirths will be destroyed. The Upanishad tells that he will achieve all the Purusharthas. 9\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Advaya-Tarakopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Ramarahasya": "\nRama Rahasya Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. Sunder Hattangadi and P. R. Ramachander\nPublished by celextel.org\n[This great Upanishad is in Atharvana Veda and is the authoritative source of Lord Rama's worship\nmethods.]\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nI salute that Lord Rama, who is the personification of salvation, who is a great king, who is a great man\nand who destroys all his enemies.\nFirst Chapter\n1-2. Great sages like Mudgala, Sandilya, Paingala, Bikshu, Sanaka and Prahlada approached Lord\nHanuman, who was a great devotee of Vishnu and asked him,\n3-4. \u201cWhich is the greatest principle among the four Veda-s, 18 purana-s, 18 Smriti-s, Sastra-s, all\nknowledge and among the great powers ruled by the Sun and moon?\u201d\n5-6. He replied, \u201cHey, great sages and devotees of Lord Vishnu! Please hear my words which cut of all\nattachments, the greatest principle among these is the principle of Brahma Taraka (OM). Rama is ParaBrahma and supreme austerity, and Rama is the Supreme Essence and Brahma Taraka.\u201d\n\n7. They all again asked, Lord Hanuman,\u201dPlease tell us the angas (aspects) of Lord Rama.\u201d\nLord Hanuman told, \u201cPlease understand that Lord Ganesha, Goddess Saraswati, Goddess Durga, all the\nKshetra Palaka-s, Sun, Moon, Lord Narayana, Lord Narasimha, Lord Vasudeva, Lord Varaha, Lord\nLakshmana, Shatrughna, Bharata, Vibheeshana, Sugreeva, Angada, Jambavanta and Pranava are the\nangas of Lord Rama. Without these angas, Lord Rama will not remove all roadblocks. They again\nasked, \u201cHow will Brahmins and householders get the capacity to recite Pranava?\u201d He said, \u201cAll People\n(even if they are not eligible to chant \u201cOm\u201d,) who chant the six letter mantra would get the capacity to\nmeditate on Pranava. Those who chant silently the mantra of Rama would get the same effect as\nrepeating the letter \u201cOm\u201d. After the name of Rishi, Devata and meter, japa of the Rama mantra would\ngive the same effect as repetition of Pranava and further he explained that Rama Himself has said that\npranava is a part of Rama mantra.\n8. On another occasion answering Vibheeshana\u2019s question \u201cHow can your angas be made easy to\nworship? Please tell me an easy way.\u201d\nRama replied, \u201cThe japa of my name \u201cRama\u201d removes all sins. Suppose some one is meditating on my\nsix lettered mantra or reads my Gita or thinks of me with devotional fervor, he would get the same\neffect. He would get rid of the five great sins, viz. killing of father, killing of mother, killing of\nbrothers, killing of teachers, killing of husband or even other well-known great sins, if one repeats my\nsix lettered mantra ten million times. He also would get the immortal and ever lasting bliss.\nVibheeshana again asked him, \u201cWhat would be the way for people who are not capable of doing It.?\u201d\nRama replied \u201cthey can either read my Gita, my thousand names or meditate on my Viswa Roopa or\nmy 108 names, or repeat my name 100 times, or read the king of stotras written by sage Narada, or read\nthe great prayer called mantra raja stavam written by Hanuman, or read the prayer to Sita or daily pray\nto me by reciting my name; they will doubtless attain Me.\u201d\nHere ends the First Chapter.\nSecond Chapter\nThe great sages led by Sanaka asked Hanuman again, \u201cPlease tell us the mantra for meditating (or\nworshipping) the Taraka Brahma Rama.\u201d\nHanuman replied:\n1. That king of mantra-s is the Ekakshara (one-syllabled) which is the store house of fire, which is Lord\nVishnu who is lying down and which is Lord Shiva who adorned with the crescent moon.\n2. Its sage is Brahma, meter is Gayatri, Deity is Lord Rama, its anga is waxing half-Moon and its mind\nis the soul of fire,\n3. Its root is the Beeja Shakti and it has to be chanted for fulfillment of desires.\n[The prayer (dhyana sloka) for the mantra is:-]\nHe who sits on the lotus flower on the shores of river Sarayu,\n4. He who is black, seated on the throne of heroes, who shines in the Jnana-Mudra that he shows,\n\nwhose left side is adorned by Sita and Lakshmana,\n5. He who shines as their soul to those souls, who pray to him, who is like the clear crystal, who is the\nonly source to those who wish for salvation,\n6. He who is the Paramatma to those thinkers, who shines like the millions of Suns, who is like\nNarayana residing in the nadi-s, who is digestive fire.\n7. The king of mantras with two syllables (Rama) would lead to fulfillment of all desires, and along\nwith the suffix of one letter, it becomes six different mantras, [they are Om, Hrim, Srim, Klim, Aim and\nRam.]\n8. These king of mantras consisting of three syllables also will fulfill all desires.\n9. The two four lettered mantras are Ramachandra and Ramabhadra.\n10. These can be chanted with the rishi and others as told before; Viswamithra is its Rishi, the meter is\npankti, Devatha is Ramabhadra, The Bheeja is Shakthi.\n11. This mantra should be invoked mentally in the middle of the eye brows, head, navel, thighs and\nfeet.\n12. One should go to the middle of the forest and sit under the Kalpa-Vriksha (wish-fulfilling or eternal\ntree) and assume the posture of \u201cPushpalata\u201d (flowering creeper plant), do the anga nyasa and chant the\nmantras,\n13. With Lakshmana having arranged properly the arrow and the Lord being fanned by Sita.\n14. Dhyana mantra:- I salute that Rama, who has lustrous matted hair, who is bluish in colour, who is\nsurrounded by sages, who is being fanned by Janaki, who is protected by Lakshmana holding an\numbrella,\n15. The one who killed Ravana, who is extremely peaceful, and before whom stand Sugreeva and\nVibeeshana. For achieving victory one should chant this sloka ten million times.\n16. The five lettered mantra-s are formed by adding the root letters for Manmatha, Durga, Saraswati\nand Lakshmi at the beginning of the four lettered mantra, [adding OM to make it six-syllabled] and\nlead to the realization of the four Purushartha-s.\n17. When each of the fifty mystic syllables of the Sanskrit alphabet (nasalized), as well as the root\nletters of Lakshmi, Saraswati, Manmatha and OM are added as the first syllable several varieties of six\nlettered mantras are formed.\n18. Chanting the four letter mantras by adding the root letters of Sri, Maya and Manmatha as prefix and\nsuffix of the four and six letter mantras grants all ones wishes.\n19. Adding svaha, or hum phat or namah at the end, in various combinations, make up the 18-lettered\nmantra-s.\n\n20. In these mantra-s, Brahma as sammohana shakti, Dakshinamurty, Agastya, and Shiva are said to be\nthe ascetics, in that order.\n21. The meter (chanda) is Gayatri, and the Deity is Shri Rama. Or, Kama-bija at the beginning and\nVishvamitra the Rishi.\n22. The meter Gayatri of different deities and Ramabhadra the \u2018devata\u2019. The shakti-bija is invoked as\nbefore as with the 6-lettered mantra.\n23. Touching on the top of the head, in the middle between the eye-brows, heart, thighs, and feet, the\nmantras are recited with bija-s and anga-nyasa.\n24. Dhyana:\nI worship Sri Rama,\nWhose body shines with various ornaments,\nWho is as brilliant as lightning,\nWho assumes the Virasana posture,\nWho shows jnana Mudra by one hand,\nWho keeps the other hand on his thigh,\nAnd who wears the crown.\n25. Then one should, with prostrations, recite \u201cRamachandraya and Ramabhadraya Namah\u201d, and the\nking of seven lettered mantras and the fulfiller of all wishes.\n26. Eight lettered mantra: Adding OM at the beginning to the two seven lettered mantras gives rise to\ntwo eight lettered mantras. OM added to the four lettered \u201cRamaya\u201d and \u201cHum Phat svaha\u201d is another 8\nlettered mantra.\n27. The Rishis and other adjuncts for the 8-lettered mantra are the same as for the 6-lettered ones.\nAgain, the 8-lettered mantra also has Rama as the Rishi.\n28. The meter is Gayatri, the Deity is Rama, OM, the pair of Shri bija-s, and Shakti bija and others are\nalso (added).\n29. Thereafter one recites the mantra-s with the 6-limbed nyasa, and recites Ramaya Namah with OM\nand a pair of Shri-bija-s.\n30. Shiva Rama Mantra: Glaum OM, Maya-bija (heart-abiding) Ramaya Namah is recited again. Shiva,\nOm, Rama mantra is the giver of all excellence.\n31. Sadashiva is spoken of as the Rishi, Gayatri as the meter, and Shiva-OM-Ramachandra as the Deity.\nDhyanam:\nI worship that Rama,\nWho has three eyes,\nWho wears the crescent,\nWho holds the trident,\nWho is anointed all over by ash,\nAnd who is with matted hair.\n\n32. I worship the three eyed one,\nWho is Abhirama, the pinnacle of beauty,\nWho wears the crescent as ear ring,\nAnd who holds the noose, the goad, the bow and the arrow,\n34. Thus meditating, devoted wholly to recitation and oblations one shall chant mantra-s one-hundred\nthousand times, offering bilva leaves, fruits, flowers, gingili seeds, and lotuses.\n35. Rama Brahma Gayatri: Even the treasures and powers, wished for by the celestials, come by\nthemselves, when the 8-lettered Raghava brahma-gayatri (is chanted).\n36. The Rishis knowing Shri-bija as my Shakti, chant the mantra-s with the limbs, as viniyoga for its\nadoration.\n37. Dhyanam:\nI worship that blue complexioned Rama,\nWho wears the bracelet on upper arm and bangle,\nWhich are studded with shining gems,\nWho has the royal umbrella held over his head,\nWho shines like millions of waxing moons,\nWho sits in the hall of one thousand sixteen golden pillars,\nAnd who is surrounded by Bharata and others.\n38. Rama Sharana Mantra: The chanting of \u201cRamam sharanam mama\u201d (i.e. Rama is my refuge)\nachieves much more than many other mantras which lead with difficulty to mere ephemeral gains and\nproductive of the misery of samsara due to the greed for the transient fruits. This mantra gives the fruits\nof all of them without the taint of greed and other defects. There is also the 8-lettered mantra which is\nwell-known in seven-fold ways. It is Om added to the seven lettered mantra.\n39. Other mantras with more letters: The 8-syllabled mantra is (chanted) seven-fold ways.

Dhyanam:\nI think of that Rama,\nWho is in the city of Ayodhya,\nWho is decorated by various gems,\n\nWho sits under a golden canopy,\nWhose doorways are decorated by mandara flowers,\n45. Who is seated on a throne,\nSurrounded by celestial vehicles,\n46. Who is praised by sages with reverence,\nWho is adorned on the left by Sita,\nWho is being served by Lakshmana,\n47. Who is blue complexioned,\nWho has a tranquil face,\nAnd who is adorned by ornaments.\nThis mantra should be recited a hundred-thousand times with exclusive devotion.\n48.

He should bathe thrice a day.\n2. He should take only sathvic foods like milk, roots, fruits or naivedya (rice pudding offered to\nthe God)\n3. He should follow the prescribed Karmas of the stage of his life (Brahmachari, Grahastha,\nVanaprastha or Sanyasi)\n4. He should give up the six negative emotions like anger, jealousy etc.\n5. He should observe purity and practice dispassionate speech.\n6. He should also observe dispassionate action and show respect to all women.\n\n7. He should observe celibacy and sleep on the bare ground.\n8. He should not have any desires.\n9. He should be devoted to his teacher.\n10. He should scrupulously observe bath, worship, recitation, meditation and oblation to the\nfire.\n11. He should meditate with utmost concentration on Rama as instructed by his teacher.\n12. He should invoke the sun, moon, Teacher, lamp, cow, Brahmin, etc.\n13. The ascetic doing this japa should sit on a tiger skin and adopt postures prescribed like the\nSwasthikasana in rotating sequence.\n14. He should seat himself below plants like Thulasi or trees like Parijata, Bilwa etc.\n15. He should count using a rosary whose beads are either made of thulasi plant or use\nrudraksha.\n16. The counting should be done mentally using the beads and should be one hundred thousand\ntimes at the altar of Maha Vishnu.\n17. Tharpana should be offered after every ten total count. After ten counts offer rice pudding,\npour over it clarified butter made from cow\u2019s milk and eat what remains after the next tenth\nportion.\n18. After this along with chanting flowers have to be offered along with the chanting of moola\nmantra,.\nThe ascetic who does this japa becomes liberated in life and the supernatural powers follow him\nlike a bride follows her groom.\nThis Rama-mantra is not only a means to liberation, but if you remember me who am Rama\u2019s\nservant, it will ensure success in these worldly affairs too.\nTo the one who for ever remembers Rama with total devotion as the final refuge of the mind, I\nam empowered to fulfill all their chosen wishes.\nTowards the task of fulfillment of the wishes of the devotees of Rama, I \u2013 as an expert in\ncarrying out Rama\u2019s commands - am always wholly alert.\nThus ends the Fourth Chapter of Rama-rahasya Upanishad.\nFifth Chapter [Conclusion]\nSanaka and other ascetics asked Hanuman: \u201c Tell us the meaning of Sri Rama mantra\u201d.\n\nHanuman replied: \u201cAmong the Rama mantras the 6-lettered is the king among them all; though\nas mentioned earlier they exist as one-, or two-, or three, or four, or five syllables or even as\nsix-, or seven-, or eight, or even as many more syllables. Lord Shiva knows in essence the glory\nof the six-syllables (mantra);\n[ shri Ramah sharanam mama! ].\nThe true meaning of the king among the Rama mantras, as well as of the eight-lettered\nNarayana and five-lettered Shiva mantras, is spoken of as thus:\nWhere yogi-s revel in the 2 syllable mantra viz. \u2018Ra ma\u2019 where the ra syllable denotes fire\nwherein abides illumination.\nIts nature as Existence-Consciousness-Bliss is regarded as the supreme meaning, the consonant\ndenoting the unchanging Brahman, and the syllable the energy of manifestation.\nKnow that Consonants joined to Syllables are used in breathing; the sound \u2018r\u2019, of the nature of\nlight, is therefore used in action.\nThe sound \u2018ma\u2019, is known as \u2018maya\u2019 indicating prosperity; being itself the seed-letter\n(bijakshara) is also equal to Brahman itself.\nWith the \u2018bindu\u2019 (anusvara), the Purusha takes on the form of Shiva-Sun-Moon, the flame as the\ncrest, and the sound as the Prakriti.\nBoth Purusha and Prakriti jointly are considered as Brahman; the bindu, sound and the\nindwelling seed-letter as Fire and digits of the Moon.\nFire and OM by their very nature abide in the seed-syllables of Rama, just as the great tree in\nthe mundane life is contained in its seed.\nSimilarly, in the seed-syllables Rama, is contained this whole moving and unmoving world. The\nname Rama is thus regarded as the seed with both these meanings.\nWhen freed of the Maya-seed (kiim), the Supreme Spirit is said to exist (alone). This grants\nliberation to aspirants, and the \u2018ma\u2019 sound is regarded as the liberator.\nFormless \u2018ma\u2019 in Rama is the grantor of enjoyment and liberation.The first letter \u2018ra\u2019 stands for\nthe term \u2018tat\u2019 (That), and \u2018ma\u2019 stands for the term \u2018tvam\u2019 (You).\nThe wise knower of Truth declare that the confluence of the above two terms end in the\nmeaning \u2018asi\u2019 (Are). The word \u2018namah\u2019 has the meaning of tvam (you) and tat is denoted by the\nword Rama.\nWhen used in the dative case (Ramaya), the meaning asi (are) is indicated in the mantra.\nWherefore, the sentence \u2018tattvamasi\u2019 grants the unitive salvation.\nTherefore, this (mantra) giver of enjoyment and liberation surpasses the afore-said sentence\n(tattvamasi). All embodied human beings are qualified for this mantra.\n\nFor those desiring liberation, the dispassionate ones, as well as house-holders and in all stages\nof life, constant meditation of OM, and especially for ascetics, is enjoined; for the knower of the\nmeaning of Rama-mantra doubtless become liberated while alive.\nOne who studies this Upanishad becomes sanctified by fire, purified by air, is freed from the sin\nof consuming intoxicants or of theft of gold or of the slaying of a Brahmin.\nOne who recites the Rama-mantra repeatedly merges in Ramachandra himself.\nTherefore, this sacred hymn: Those whoever say \u201cI am Rama in essence\u201d, will not feel any want\nin this life, and without a doubt is Rama Himself\u201d.\nThis is the Truth. This is the Upanishad.\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm !

Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n\nThe Tatva (principle/philosophy) of Rama exists in this world, with his life showing the way to live,\nwith his name showing the way of ethereal knowledge, and also blessing all those who meditate or\nworship it with wealth and renunciation.\nThe word \u2018Rama\u2019 on which yogis devote themselves is immeasurable and forever joyful and indicates\nPara Brahman itself.\nThe body has been ascribed to Para Brahman which is holy, without any second, which does not have\nany blemishes and which is bodiless, so that the worshippers are shown the path. 1\nSimilar to the whole banyan tree existing in the seed of the banyan tree, the entire world exists in the\nseed \u201cRama\u201d. 2\nRama when incarnated shone along with Sita, who is nature herself, like the moon shining with its\nmoonlight. He who was born to Mother Kousalya, was black in colour, wore yellow silk, had his hair\nmade up, wore ear studs and chains of precious stones, had in his hand the bow, had two hands, had a\nvery pleasant smiling face and was heroic and blessed with victory and ruled with the help of eight\nministers lead by Drishti. He was keeping the Parameshwari who was the mother of the world, who\nwas nature, who had two hands, who was well made up and was holding lotus flower in her hand, on\nhis lap and lightly embracing her. 3\nHe with Sita formed a triangle with Lakshmana who was holding a bow in his hand and was golden in\ncolour. The devas approached him who was sitting below \u201cthe wish giving tree\u201d in the form of a\ntriangle and prayed, \u201cOur salutations to you, who is personification of passion and illusion and also a\ngod primeval to Vedas. Our salutations to the Raghu Veera, who killed Ravana, who is drowned in joy\nby keeping Goddess Lakshmi on his chest, who is the personification of all souls, who is an ornament\nto the body of Janaki (daughter of Janaka), who killed Rakshasas, who is very handsome and who is\npersonification of all that is good.\u201d 4\nThe devas further told \u201cHey, the killer of Ravana, please give us your protection and your grace.\u201d Then\nthey were with him and became very happy. 5\nOn his left with Satrugna, on his right with Bharata and on his front Hanuman who was listening to his\nadvices, there was another triangle. Below Bharata was Sugreeva and below him was Vibheeshana.\nBehind him Lakshmana was holding an umbrella and below him Vibheeshana and Sugreeva were\nholding fans made of palm leaves. This was another inverted triangle. So the long armed Lord Rama\nwho was shining was meditating in between this figure with six vertices. This is the first row\nsurrounding him. The second is surrounded by Vasudeva and others (Santhi, Sankarshana, Sree\nPradyumna, Saraswathi, Anirudha and Rathi) as well as fire and others in different directions.\nThird is surrounded by Hanuman, Sugreeva, Bharata, Vibheeshana, Lakshmana, Angada, Jambhavan,\nSatrugna as well as Drushti, Jayantha, Vijaya, Surashtra, Rashtra Vardhana, Ashoka, Darmapala and\nSumandra.\nFourth is surrounded by the 10 dig-balakas (protectors of directions) viz., Indra, Agni (fire God), Yama\n(god of death), Nirruthi, Varuna, Chandra, Isana, Brahma and Anantha.\nFifth is beyond the Dig-balakas and consists of their principal arms viz., Vajra, Shakthi, Danda, Vara,\nPasa, Angusa, Gada, Soola, Madma and chakra; these should be worshipped.\n\nSixth: After the arms, Neela and other monkeys. Vasishta, Vamadeva and other sages worship him. He\nshould be meditated and worshipped. 6\nThus worship Sri Rama who has the form which is the foundation of this world and who is forever\njoyful. All people who worship him as the one carrying mace, sword, conch and lotus and who is\nknown as the one who removes births and deaths will attain salvation.\nThus ends the Sri Rama Poorva Tapaniya Upanishad.\nII. Rama Uttara Tapaniya Upanishad\nOm ! May my speech be based on (i.e. accord with) the mind;\nMay my mind be based on speech.\nO Self-effulgent One, reveal Thyself to me.\nMay you both (speech and mind) be the carriers of the Veda to me.\nMay not all that I have heard depart from me.\nI shall join together (i.e. obliterate the difference of) day\nAnd night through this study.\nI shall utter what is verbally true;\nI shall utter what is mentally true.\nMay that (Brahman) protect me;\nMay That protect the speaker (i.e. the teacher), may That protect me;\nMay that protect the speaker \u2013 may That protect the speaker.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nIn Varanasi Lord Shiva did Japa (chanted) of the Rama Mantra. Pleased because of this, Sri Rama told\nLord Sankara as follows:\nIn this temple (city) whoever worships me with devotion, I would help him get rid of sins like Brahma\nHathi (killing of a Brahmin). Those of them who get the six letter mantra (Ram Ramaya NamaH) either\nfrom you or Brahma or his disciple line, would live with mastery over the mantra or attain salvation. At\nthe time of death, if you tell this mantra in their ears, they would get salvation. 1\nBrahma then thought in his mind about that Maha Vishnu, who is the foundation of this world, who is\nthat Narayana, who does not have any deficiencies and who is that Parameshwara, who is of the form\nof Para Brahman and who is full of complete joy and then worshipped him as follows: 2\nOm! He who is Ramachandra is verily the God. He is the \u2018non-dual soul of great happiness\u2019. I salute\nhim again and again in earth, bhuvar loka and Suvar loka. 3.1\nThis is followed by the repetition of the mantra 47 times with modification of the words with in quotes\nviz. \u201cnon-dual soul of great happiness\u2019.\nOnly this portion is being translated below.

A SUMMARY OF PURUSHASUKTA\nWe shall explain the Purusha-sukta: In \u2018a thousand-headed\u2019 thousand means countless; the word \u2018ten\nfingers\u2019, means infinite distance, by the first stanza Vishnu\u2019s pervasion in space is stated, by the second\nthe pervasion in time; the third speaks of his giving liberation. The glory of Vishnu is given in \u2018Etavan\u2019\n(so much is his greatness). The same stanza states his four-fold nature. \u2018Tripad\u2019 etc., speaks of the glory\nof Aniruddha. In \u2018from that Virat was born\u2019 has been shown the origin of Prakriti and Purusha from a\nquarter of Hari. By \u2018Yat Purushena\u2019 the sacrifice of creation is stated as well as Moksha. In \u2018Tasmad\u2019\nworld creations are stated. \u2018Vedaham\u2019 speaks of Hari\u2019s glory. By \u2018Yajnena\u2019 is stated the end of creation\nand liberation. One who knows it becomes liberated.\nII. THE SUPREME MYSTERY\n\nIn Mudgalopanishad the greatness of Purusha-sukta has been stated in detail. Vasudeva instructed the\nknowledge of Bhagavan to Indra; again imparted to the humble Indra the great mystery with two\nsections of the Purusha-sukta. These two are: The Purusha described above gave up the object which\nwas beyond the scope of name and form, hard for worldly people to understand and took a form with a\nthousand parts and capable of giving Moksha on sight, for uplifting the suffering Devas and others. In\nthat form, pervading the world he was beyond it by an infinite distance. This Narayana was the Past,\nPresent and the Future. And was the giver of Moksha to all. He is greater than the greatest \u2013 none is\ngreater than He.\nHe made himself into four parts and with three of them exists in the heaven. By the fourth, the\nAniruddha (for of) Narayana, all worlds have come to be. This (part of) Narayana created Prakriti\n(Matter) for making the worlds (Prakriti stands for the four-faced Brahma). In full form the latter did\nnot know the work of creation \u2013 this Aniruddha-Narayana told him.\nBrahman ! Meditate upon your organs as the sacrifice, the firm body of the sheaths as the oblation, me\nas Agni, the spring season as ghee, summer as fuel, autumn as the six tastes of food and make the\noffering in Agni and touch the body \u2013 this will make the body (strong like) Vajra (diamond). Thence\nwill appear the products like animals. From the, the world of moving and unmoving things. It must be\nunderstood that the manner of liberation is stated by the combination of Jiva and Paramatman.\nWhoever knows this Creation and Liberation lives a full life.\nIII\nThe single God becoming many; unborn, is born as many. The Adhvaryus worship him as Agni. This as\nYajus unites everything. The Samavedins worship as Saman. All is established in him. The serpents\nmeditate on his as poison. The knowers of snake-lore as snake, gods as energy, men as wealth, Demons\nas Magic, the manes as sustenance. The knowers of the superhuman as superhuman. Gandharvas as\nbeauty, Apsarases as perfume. He becomes whatever he is worshipped as; so, one should think \u2018I am\nthe supreme being\u2019 and will become that (who knows this).\nIV. ONLY BRAHMAN WITH THE THREEFOLD MISSING IS JIVA\nBeyond the threefold misery, free from layers devoid of the six waves, other than the five sheaths,\nunaffected by the six transformations is the Brahman. The three miseries are Adhyatmika (body\ndisease), Adhibhautika (robbers, wild animals etc.,) and Adhidaivika (rains etc.,). They relate to agents,\naction and effect; knower, knowledge and the known; experiencer, experience and the experienced. The\nsix layers are skin, flesh, blood, bones, tendons and morrow. The six enemies are lust etc. The five\nsheaths are those of food, vital airs, mind cognition and bliss. The six transformations are: being, birth,\ngrowth, change, decline and destruction. The six waves are hunger, thirst, sorrow, delusion, old age and\ndeath. The six delusions are about family, lineage, class, caste, stations (ashrama) and forms. Through\ncontact with the supreme spirit becomes the Jiva \u2013 he is none other.\nHe who studies this is purified in fire, wind and sun; has health and wealth, becomes rich in children\nand grandchildren, a scholar, purified from great sin, drink, improper contact with mother, daughter and\ndaughter-in-law, stealing gold, forgetting Vedic learning, failure to serve elders, sacrificing for the unfit,\neating what should not be, wrong gifts, contact with another\u2019s wife, unaffected by lust etc., becomes the\npristine Brahman in this birth. Therefore one should not impart to an uninitiated person this Purushasukta which is a secret, nor to one who does not know the Vedas, a non-sacrificer, a non-Vaishnava,\nnon-Yogin, a talkative person, a harsh talker, one who takes more than a year to learn, the discontented.\nThe Guru shall impart this in a pure place, on a sacred star, after regulating the vital airs to the humble\ndisciple, in the right ear. It should not be done too often \u2013 it would become stale but as often as needed,\nin the ear.\nThus both the teacher and the taught will become Purusha in this birth.\nThis is the Upanishad.\n\nOm! May my speech be based on (i.e. accord with) the mind;\nMay my mind be based on speech.\nO Self-effulgent One, reveal Thyself to me.\nMay you both (speech and mind) be the carriers of the Veda to me.\nMay not all that I have heard depart from me.\nI shall join together (i.e. obliterate the difference of) day\nAnd night through this study.\nI shall utter what is verbally true;\nI shall utter what is mentally true.\nMay that (Brahman) protect me;\nMay That protect the speaker (i.e. the teacher), may That protect me;\nMay that protect the speaker \u2013 may That protect the speaker.\nOm !

    "Sandilya": "\nSandilya Upanishad\nTranslated by K. Narayanasvami Aiyar\nOm !

Sandilya questioned Atharvan thus: \"Please tell me about the eight Angas (parts) of Yoga which is\nthe means of attaining to Atman\".\nAtharvan replied: \"The eight Angas of Yoga are Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara,\nDharana, Dhyana and Samadhi. Of these, Yama is of ten kinds; and so is Niyama. There are eight\nAsanas. Pranayama is of three kinds; Pratyahara is of five kinds; so also is Dharana. Dhyana is of two\nkinds and Samadhi is of one kind only. Under Yama (forbearance) are ten: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya,\nBrahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha. Of these, Ahimsa is the not\ncausing of any pain to any living being at any time through the actions of one\u2019s mind, speech, or body.\nSatya is the speaking of the truth that conduces to the well-being of creatures, through the actions of\none\u2019s mind, speech, or body. Asteya is not coveting of another\u2019s property through the actions of one\u2019s\nmind, speech, or body. Brahmacharya is the refraining from sexual inter-course in all places and in all\nstates in mind, speech or body. Daya is kindliness towards all creatures in all places. Arjava is the\npreserving of equanimity of mind, speech, or body in the performance or non-performance of the\nactions ordained or forbidden to be done. Kshama is the bearing patiently of all pleasant or unpleasant\nthings, such as praise or blow. Dhriti is the preserving of firmness of mind during the period of gain or\n\nloss of wealth or relatives. Mitahara is the taking of oily and sweet food, leaving one-fourth of the\nstomach empty. Saucha is of two kinds, external and internal. Of these, the external is the cleansing of\nthe body by earth and water; the internal is the cleansing of the mind. This (the latter) is to be obtained\nby means of the Adhyatma-Vidya (Science of Self).\n2. Under Niyama (religious observances), are ten, viz., Tapas, Santosha Astikya, Dana, Ishvarapujana,\nSiddhanta-Sravana, Hrih, Mati, Japa and Vrata. Of these Tapas, is the emancipation of the body through\nthe observances of such penances as Krichchhra, Chandrayana, etc., according to rules. Santosha is\nbeing satisfied with whatever comes to us of its own accord. Astikya is the belief in the merits or\ndemerits of actions as stated in the Vedas. Dana is the giving with faith to deserving persons, money,\ngrains, etc., earned lawfully. Ishvarapujana is the worshipping of Vishnu, Rudra, etc., with pure mind\naccording to one\u2019s power. Siddhanta-Sravana is the inquiry into the significance of Vedanta. Hrih is the\nshame felt in the performance of things contrary to the rules of the Vedas and of Society. Mati is the\nfaith in the paths laid down by the Vedas. Japa is the practising of the Mantras into which one is duly\ninitiated by his spiritual instructor and which is not against (the rules of) the Vedas. It is of two kinds \u2013\nthe spoken and the mental. The mental is associated with contemplation by the mind. The spoken is of\ntwo kinds \u2013 the loud and the low. The loud pronunciation gives the reward as stated (in the Vedas):\n(while) the low one (gives) a reward thousand times (that). The mental (gives) a reward a Crore (of\ntimes that). Vrata is the regular observance of or the refraining from the actions enjoined or prohibited\nby the Vedas.\n3. Asanas (the postures) are (chiefly) eight, viz., Svastika, Gomukha, Padma, Vira, Simha, Bhadra,\nMukta and Mayura. Svastika is the sitting at ease with the body erect, placing each foot between the\nthighs and knees of the other.\n4. Gomukha is (the sitting at ease with the body erect) placing the hollow of the left foot under the side\nof the right posteriors and the hollow of the right foot under the side of the left posteriors, resembling\nGomukha (cow\u2019s face).\n5. Padma is (the sitting at ease with the body erect) placing the back of each foot in the thigh of the\nother, the right hand grasping the right toe and the left hand to left toe. This, O Sandilya, is praised by\nall.\n6. Vira is the sitting at ease (with the body erect), placing one foot on the thigh of the other and the\nother foot underneath the corresponding (opposite thigh).\n7-8. Simha is (the sitting at ease with the body erect) pressing the right side (of the thigh) with the\nhollow of left heel and vice versa. Rest your hands on the knees, spread out the fingers, open your\nmouth and carefully fix your gaze on the tip of your nose. This is always praised by the Yogins.\n9. Siddha is (the sitting at ease with the body erect) pressing the perineum with the left heel and placing\nthe heel of the right foot above the genital organ, concentrating the mind between the two eyebrows.\n10. Bhadra is (the sitting at ease with the body erect) pressing the two ankles of the two feet firmly\ntogether against the Sivini (viz., lower part of the seed) and binding the knees firmly with the hands.\nThis is the Bhadra which destroys all diseases and poisons.\n11. Mukta is (the sitting at ease with the body erect) pressing with the left heel the right side of the\ntender part of the Sivini and with the right heel the lest side of the tender part of the Sivini.\n12-13. Mayura (lit., peacock): Rest your body upon the ground with both palms and place your elbows\n\non the sides of the navel, lift up the head and feet and remain like a stick in the air, (like the plant\nbalance in gymnastics). This is the Mayura posture which destroys all sins.\n14. By these, all the diseases within the body are destroyed; all the poisons are digested. Let the person\nwho is unable to practise all these postures betake himself to any one (of these) which he may find easy\nand pleasant. He who conquers (or gets mastery over) the postures - he conquers the three worlds. A\nperson who has the practice of Yama and Niyama should practise Pranayama; by that the Nadis become\npurified.\"\n15. Then Sandilya questioned Atharvan thus: \"By what means are the Nadis purified ? How many are\nthey in number ? How do they arise ? What Vayus (vital airs) are located in them ? What are their\nseats? What are their functions? Whatever is worthy of being known in the body, please tell me\". To\nthat Atharvan replied (thus): \"This body is ninety-six digits in length. Prana extends twelve digits\nbeyond the body. He who through the practice of Yoga reduces his Prana within his body to make it\nequal to or not less than the fire in it becomes the greatest of the Yogins. In men, the region of fire\nwhich is triangular in form and brilliant as the molten gold is situated in the middle of the body. In fourfooted animals, it (fire) is quadrangular. In birds, it is round. In its (the region of life\u2019s) centre, the\npurifying, beneficial and subtle flame is situate. Two digits above the anus and two digits below the\nsexual organ is the centre of the body for men. For four-footed animals, it is the middle of the heart. For\nbirds, it is the middle of the body. Nine digits from (or above) the centre of the body and four digits in\nlength and breadth is situated an oval form. In its midst is the navel. In it, is situated the Chakra (viz.,\nwheel) with twelve spokes. In the middle of the Chakra, the Jiva (Atman) wanders, driven by its good\nand bad deeds. As a spider flies to and fro within a web of fine threads, so Prana moves about here. In\nthis body, the Jiva rides upon Prana. Lying in the middle of the navel and above it, is the seat of\nKundalini. The Kundalini Sakti is of the form of eight Prakritis (matter) and coils itself eight ways or\n(times). The movement of Vayus (vital airs) checks duly the food and drink all round by the side of\nSkandha. It closes by its head (the opening of) the Brahmarandhra and during the time of (the practice\nof) Yoga is awakened by the fire (in the Apana); then it shines with great brilliancy in the Akasa of the\nheart in the shape of wisdom. Depending upon Kundalini which is situated in the centre, there are\nfourteen principal Nadis (viz.,) Ida, Pingala, Susumna, Sarasvati, Varuni, Pusha, Hastijihva, Yasasvini,\nVisvodhari, Kuhuh, Sankhini, Payasvini, Alambusa and Gandhari. Of them, Susumna is said to be the\nsustainer of the universe and the path of salvation. Situated at the back of the anus, it is attached to the\nspinal column and extends to the Brahmarandhra of the head and is invisible and subtle and is\nVaishnavi (or has the Sakti force of Vishnu). On the left of Susumna is situated Ida and on the right is\nPingala. The moon moves in Ida and the sun in Pingala. The moon is of the nature of Tamas and the\nsun of Rajas. The poison share is of the sun and the nectar of the moon. They both direct (or indicate)\ntime and Susumna is the enjoyer (or consumer) of time. To the back and on the side of Susumna are\nsituate Sarasvati and Kuhuh respectively. Between Yasasvini and Kuhuh stands Varuni. Between Pusha\nand Sarasvati lies Payasvini. Between Gandhari and Sarasvati is situated Yasasvini. In the centre of the\nnavel is Alambusa. In front of Susumna there is Kuhuh, which proceeds as far as the genital organ.\nAbove and below Kundalini is situated Varuni, which proceeds everywhere. Yasasvini which is\nbeautiful (or belonging to the moon), proceeds to the great toes. Pingala goes upwards to the right\nnostril. Payasvini goes to right ear. Sarasvati goes to the upper part or the tongue and Sankhini to the\nleft ear, (while) Gandhari goes from the back of Ida to the left eye. Alambusa goes upwards and\ndownwards from the root of the anus. From these fourteen Nadis, other (minor) Nadis spring; from\nthem springing others and from them springing others; so it should be known. As the leaf of the\nAsvattha tree (ficus religiosa) etc., is covered with minute fibres so also is this body permeated with\nNadis.\n\"Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya these ten\n\nVayus (vital airs) move in all the Nadis. Prana moves in the nostrils, the throat, the navel, the two great\ntoes and the lower and the upper parts of Kundalini. Vyana moves in the ear, the eye, the loins, the\nankles, the nose, the throat and the buttocks. Apana moves in the anus, the genitals, the thighs, the\nknees, the stomach, the seeds, the lions, the calves, the navel and the seat of the anus of fire. Udana\nlives in all the joints and also in the hands and legs. Samana lives, permeating in all parts of the body.\nAlong with the fire in the body, it causes the food and drink taken in, to spread in the body. It moves in\nthe seventy-two thousand Nadis and pervades all over the body along with the fire. The fire Vayus\nbeginning with Naga go towards the skin, the bones, etc. The Prana which is in the navel separates the\nfood and drink which is there and brings about the Rasas (juices) and others. Placing the water above\nthe fire and the food above (or in) the water, it goes to the Apana and along with it, fans up the fire in\nthe centre of the body. The fire thus fanned up by the Apana gradually increases in brightness in the\nmiddle of the body. Then it causes through its flames the water which is brought in the bowels by the\nPrana to grow hot. The fire with the water causes the food and conditions, which are placed above, to\nbe boiled to a proper degree. Then Prana separates these into sweat, urine, water, blood, semen, the\nfaeces and the like. And along with the Samana, it takes the juice (or essence) to all the Nadis and\nmoves in the body in the shape of breath. The Vayus excrete the urine, the faeces, etc., through the nine\nopenings in the body which are connected with the outside air. The functions of Prana are inspiration,\nexpiration and cough. Those of Apana are the excretion of the faeces and the urine. Those of Vyana are\n(such actions as) giving and taking. Those of Udana are keeping the body straight, etc. Those of\nSamana are nourishing the body. Those of Naga are vomiting, etc.; of Kurma, the movement of the\neyelids; of Krikara, the causing of hunger, etc., of Devadatta, idleness, etc., and Dhananjaya phlegm.\nHaving thus acquired a thorough knowledge of the seat of the Nadis and of the Vayus with their\nfunctions, one should begin with the purification of the Nadis.\n16. A person possessed of Yama and Niyama, avoiding all company, having finished his course of\nstudy, delighting in truth and virtue, having conquered (his) anger, being engaged in the service of his\nspiritual instructor and having been obedient to his parents and well instructed in all the religious\npractices and the knowledge of his order of life, should go to a sacred grove abounding in fruits, roots\nand water. There he should select a pleasant spot always resounding with the chanting of the Vedas,\nfrequented by the knowers of Brahman that persevere in the duties of their orders of life and filled with\nfruits, roots, flowers and water. (Else) either in a temple or on the banks of a river or in a village or in a\ntown, he should build a beautiful monastery. It should be neither too long nor too high, should have a\nsmall door, should be besmeared well with cow-dung and should have every sort of protection. There\nlistening to the exposition of Vedanta, he should begin to practise Yoga. In the beginning having\nworshipped Vinayaka (Ganesha), he should salute his Ishta-Devata (tutelary deity) and sitting in any of\nthe above-mentioned postures on a soft seat, facing either the east or the north and having conquered\nthem, the learned man keeping his head and neck erect and fixing his gaze on the tip of his nose, should\nsee the sphere of the moon between his eyebrows and drink the nectar (flowing therefrom through his\neyes). Inhaling the air through Ida for the space of twelve matras, he should contemplate on the sphere\nof fire situated in the belly as surrounded with flames and having as its seed \u2018ra\u2019; then he should exhale\nit through Pingala. Again inhaling it through Pingala and retaining it (within), he should exhale it\nthrough Ida. For the period of twenty-eight months, he should practise six times at every sitting through\nthe three Sandhyas (morning, noon and evening) and during the intervals. By this, the Nadis becomes\npurified. Then the body becomes light and bright, the (gastric) fire is increased (within) and there is the\nmanifestation of Nada (internal sound).\n17. Pranayama is said to be the union of Prana and Apana. It is of three kinds - expiration, inspiration\nand cessation. They are associated with the letters of the (Sanskrit) alphabet (for the right performance\nof Pranayama). Therefore Pranava (OM) only is said to be Pranayama. Sitting in the Padma posture,\n\nthe person should meditate that there is at the tip of his nose Gayatri, a girl of red complexion\nsurrounded by the numberless rays of the image of the moon and mounted on a Hamsa (swan) and\nhaving a mace in her hand. She is the visible symbol of the letter \u2018A\u2019. The letter \u2018U\u2019 has as its visible\nsymbol Savitri, a young woman of white colour having a disk in her hand and riding on a Garuda\n(eagle). The letter \u2018M\u2019 has as its visible symbol Sarasvati, an aged woman of black colour riding on a\nbull, having a trident in her hand. He should meditate that the single letter \u2013 the supreme light \u2013 the\nPranava (OM) \u2013 is the origin or source of these three letters \u2018A\u2019, \u2018U\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019. Drawing up the air\nthrough Ida for the space of sixteen matras, he should meditate on the letter \u2018A\u2019 during that time;\nretaining the inspired air for the space of sixty-four matras, he should meditate on the letter \u2018U\u2019 during\nthe time; he should then exhale the inspired air for the space of thirty-two matras, meditating on the\nletter \u2018M\u2019 during that time. He should practise this in the above order over and over again.\n18. Then having become firm in the posture and preserved perfect self-control, the Yogin should, in\norder to clear away the impurities of the Susumna, sit in the Padmasana (Padma posture) and having\ninhaled the air through the left nostril, should retain it as long as he can and should exhale it through\nthe right. Then drawing it again through the right and having retained it, he should exhale it through the\nleft in the order that he should draw it through the same nostril by which he exhaled it before and\nretained it. In this context, occur (to memory) the following verses:\n\"In the beginning having inhaled the breath (Prana) through the left nostril, according to the rule, he\nshould exhale it through the other; then having inhaled the air through the right nostril should retain it\nand exhale it through the other. To those who practise according to these rules through the right and left\nnostrils, the nadis become purified within three months.\n19. He should practise cessation of breath at sunrise, in the midday, at sunset and at midnight slowly till\neighty (times a day) for four weeks.\n20. In the early stages, perspiration is produced; in the middle stage the tremor of the body and in the\nlast stage levitation in the air. These (results) ensure out of the repression of the breath, while sitting in\nthe Padma posture.\n21. When perspiration arises with effort, he should rub his body well. By this, the body becomes firm\nand light.\n22. In the early course of his practice, food with milk and ghee is excellent. One sticking to this rule\nbecomes firm in his practice and gets no Tapa (or burning sensation in the body).\n23. As lions, elephants and tigers are gradually tamed, so also the breath when rightly managed (comes\nunder control); else it kills the practitioner.\n24. He should (as far as is consistent with his health and safety) properly exhale it, properly inhale it or\nretain it properly. Thus (only) will he attain success.\n25. By thus retaining the breath in an approved manner and by the purification of the Nadis, the\nbrightening of the (gastric) fire, the hearing distinctly of (spiritual) sounds and (good) health result.\n26-30. When the nervous centres have become purified through the regular practice of Pranayama, the\nair easily forces its way up through the mouth of the Susumna which is in the middle. By the\ncontraction of the muscles of the neck and by the contraction of the one below (viz.,) Apana, the Prana\n(breath) goes into the Susumna which is in the middle from the west Nadi. Drawing up the Apana and\nforcing down the Prana from the throat, the Yogin free from old age becomes a youth of sixteen.\n\n31. Seated in a pleasant posture and drawing up the air through the right nostril and retaining it inside\nfrom the top of the hair to the toe nails, he should exhale it through the same nostril. Through it, the\nbrain becomes purified and the diseases in the air Nadis are destroyed. Drawing up the air through the\nnostrils with noise (so as to fill the space) from the heart to the neck and having retained it (within) as\nlong as possible, he should exhale it through the nose. Through this hunger, thirst, idleness and sleep do\nnot arise. Taking in the air through the mouth (wide open) and having retained it as long as possible, he\nshould expel it through the nose. Through this, (such diseases as) Gulma; Pleeha (both being splenetic\ndiseases), bile and fever as also hunger, etc., are destroyed. Now we shall proceed to Kumbhaka\n(restraint of breath). It is of two kinds - Sahita and Kevala. That which is coupled with expiration and\ninspiration is called Sahita. That which is devoid of these is called Kevala (alone). Until you become\nperfect in Kevala, practise Sahita. To one who has mastered Kevala, there is nothing unattainable in the\nthree worlds. By Kevala-restraint of breath, the knowledge of Kundalini arises. Then he becomes lean\nin body, serene in face and clear eyed, hears the (spiritual) sounds distinctly, becomes free from all\ndiseases and conquers his (Bindu) seminal fluid, his gastric fire being increased. Centring one\u2019s mind\non an inward object whilst his eyes are looking outside without shutting and opening of his eyelids, has\nbeen called Vaishnavi-mudra. This is kept hidden in all the Tantric works.\n32. With his mind and breath absorbed in an internal object, the Yogin, though he does not really see\nthe objects outside and under him, still (appears to) see them with eyes in which the pupils are\nmotionless. This is called Khechari-mudra. It has as its sphere of extension one object and is very\nbeneficial. (Then) the real seat of Vishnu, which is void and non-void, dawns on him.\n33. With eyes half closed and with a firm mind, fixing his eyes on the tip of his nose and becoming\nabsorbed in the sun and moon, he after remaining thus unshaken (becomes conscious of) the thing\nwhich is resplendent, which is the supreme truth and which is beyond. O Sandilya, know this to be Tat\n(That).\n34. Merging the sound in the light and elevating the brows a little, this is of the way of (or is a part of)\nthe former practice. This brings about the state of Unmani which causes the destruction of the mind.\n35. Therefore he should practise the Khechari-mudra. Then he attains to the state of Unmani and falls\ninto the Yoga sleep (trance). To one who obtains this Yoga sleep, time does not exist. Placing the mind\nin the midst of Sakti and Sakti in the midst of the mind and looking on the mind with the mind, O\nSandilya be happy.\n36. Place the Atman in the midst of Akasa and Akasa in the midst of Atman and having reduced\neverything to Akasa, do not think of anything else.\n37. You should not (then) entertain thoughts, either external or internal. Abandoning all thoughts,\nbecome abstract thought itself.\n38. As camphor in fire and salt in water become absorbed, so also the mind becomes absorbed in the\nTattva (Truth).\n39. What is termed Manas (mind) is the knowledge of everything that is known and its clear\napprehension. When the knowledge and the object cognised are lost alike, there is no second path (or\nthat is the only path).\n40. By its giving up all cognition of objects, it (the mind) is absorbed and when the mind is absorbed,\nKaivalya (isolation) alone remains.\n\n41. For the destruction of the Chitta, there are two ways - Yoga and Jnana. O prince of sages, Yoga is\nthe (forcible) repression of the modifications of the mind and Jnana is the thorough inquiry into them.\n42-45. When the modifications of the mind are repressed, it (the mind) verily obtains peace. Just as the\nactions of the people cease with the stopping of the fluctuations of the sun (viz., with sunset), so when\nthe fluctuations of the mind cease, this cycle of births and deaths comes to an end. (Then) the\nfluctuations of Prana are prevented, when one has no longing for this mundane existence or when he\nhas gratified his desires therein - through the study of religious books, the company of good men,\nindifference (to enjoyments), practice and Yoga or long contemplation with intentness on any desired\n(higher) object or through practising one truth firmly.\n46. By the repression of the breath through inhalation, etc., by continual practice therein which does not\ncause fatigue and by meditating in a secluded place, the fluctuations of the mind are arrested. Through\nthe right realisation of the true nature of the sound which is at the extreme end of the pronunciation of\nthe syllable OM (viz., Ardhamatra) and when Sushupti (dreamless sleeping state) is rightly cognised\nthrough consciousness, the fluctuations of Prana are repressed.\n47. When the passage at the root of the palate which is like the bell, viz., Uvula, is closed by the tongue\nwith effort and when the breath goes up through (the upper hole), then the fluctuations of Prana are\nstopped.\n48-50. When the consciousness (Samvit) is merged in Prana and when through practice the Prana goes\nthrough the upper hole into the Dvadasanta (the twelfth centre) above the palate, then the fluctuations\nof Prana are stopped. When the eye of consciousness (viz., the spiritual or third eye) becomes calm and\nclear so as to be able to distinctly see in the transparent Akasa at a distance of twelve digits from the tip\nof his nose, then the fluctuations of Prana are stopped. When the thoughts arising in the mind are bound\nup in the calm contemplation of the world of Taraka (star or eye) between one\u2019s eyebrows and are\n(thus) destroyed, then the fluctuations cease.\n51. When the knowledge which is of the form of the knowable, which is beneficent and which is\nuntouched by any modifications arises in one and is known as OM only and no other, then the\nfluctuations of Prana cease.\n52. By the contemplation for a long time of the Akasa which is in the heart and by the contemplation of\nthe mind free from Vasanas, then the fluctuations of Prana cease.\n53. By these methods and various others suggested by (one\u2019s) thought and by means of the contact of\nthe many (spiritual) guides, the fluctuations cease.\n54. Having by contraction opened the door of Kundalini, one should force open the door of Moksha.\nClosing with her mouth the door through which one ought to go, the Kundalini sleeps spiral in form\nand coiled up like a serpent. He who causes this Kundalini to move - he is an emancipated person. If\nthis Kundalini were to sleep in the upper part of the neck of any Yogin, it goes towards his\nemancipation. (If it were to sleep) in the lower part (of the body), it is for the bondage of the ignorant.\nLeaving the two Nadis, Ida and the other (Paingala), it (Prana) should move in the Susumna. That is the\nsupreme seat of Vishnu. One should practise control of breath with the concentration of the mind. The\nmind should not be allowed by a clever man to rest on any other thing.\n55. One should not worship Vishnu during the day alone. One should not worship Vishnu during the\nnight alone; but should always worship Him and should not worship Him merely during day and night.\n\n56. The wisdom-producing opening (near Uvula) has five passages. O Sandilya, this is the Khecharimudra; practise it.\n57. With one who sits in the Khechari-mudra, the Vayu which was flowing before through the left and\nright Nadis now flows through the middle one (Susumna. There is no doubt about it.\n58. You should swallow the air through the void (Susumna) between Ida and Pingala. In that place is\nKhechari-mudra situated and that is the seat of Truth.\n59. Again that is Khechari-mudra which is situated in the Akasa-Chakra (in the head) in the Niralamba\n(supportless) seat between the sun and moon (viz., Ida and Pingala).\n60-61. When the tongue has been lengthened to the length of a Kala (digit) by the incision (of the\nfraenum lingum) and by rubbing and milking it (viz., the tongue), fix the gaze between the two\neyebrows and close the hole in the skull with the tongue reversed. This is Khechari-mudra. With the\ntongue and the Chitta (mind) both move in the Akasa (Khechari), then the person with his tongue raised\nup becomes immortal. Firmly pressing the Yoni (perineum) by the left heel, stretching out the right leg,\ngrasping the feet with both hands and inhaling the air through the nostrils, practise Kantha-Bandha,\nretaining the air upwards. By that, all afflictions are destroyed; then poison is digested as if it were\nnectar. Asthma, splenetic disease, the turning up of the anus and the numbness of the skin are removed.\nThis is the means of conquering Prana and destroying death. Pressing the Yoni by the left heel, place\nthe other foot over the left thigh: inhale the air, rest the chin on the chest, contract the Yoni and\ncontemplate, (as far as possible), your Atman as situated within your mind. Thus is the direct\nperception (of truth) attained. Inhaling the Prana from outside and filling the stomach with it, centre the\nPrana with the mind in the middle of the navel at the tip of the nose and at the toes during the Sandhyas\n(sunset and sunrise) or at all times. (Thus) the Yogin is freed from all diseases and fatigue.\n62. By centring his Prana at the tip of his nose, he obtains mastery over the element of air; by centring\nit at the middle of his navel, all diseases are destroyed; by centring it at the toes, his body becomes\nlight. He who drinks the air (drawn) through the tongue destroys fatigue, thirst and diseases.\n63. He who drinks the air with his mouth during the two Sandhyas and the last two hours of the night,\nwithin three months the auspicious Sarasvati (goddess of speech) is present in his Vak (speech) (viz., he\nbecomes eloquent and learned in his speech).\n64. In six months, he is free from all diseases. Drawing the air by the tongue, retain the air at the root of\nthe tongue. The wise man thus drinking nectar enjoys all prosperity.\n65. Fixing the Atman in the Atman itself in the middle of the eyebrows, (having inhaled) through Ida\nand breaking through that (centre) thirty times, even a sick man is freed from disease.\n66. He who draws the air through the Nadis and retains it for twenty-four minutes in the navel and in\nthe sides of the stomach becomes freed from disease.\n67-69(a). He who for the space of a month during the three Sandhyas (sunset, sunrise and midnight or\nnoon) draws the air through the tongue, pierces thirty times and retains his breath in the middle of his\nnavel, becomes freed from all fevers and poisons. He who retains the Prana together with the mind at\nthe tip of his nose even for the space of a Muhurta (forty-eight minutes), destroys all sins that were\ncommitted by him during one hundred births.\n69(b). Through the Samyama of Tara (Om), he knows all things. By retaining the mind at the tip of his\nnose, he acquires a knowledge of Indra-world; below that, he acquires a knowledge of Agni (fire)\n\nworld. Through the Samyama of Chitta in the eye, he gets a knowledge of all worlds; in the ear, a\nknowledge of Yama (the god of death) world); in the sides of the ear, a knowledge of Nrriti-world; in\nthe back of it (the ear), a knowledge of Varuna-world; in the left ear, a knowledge of Vayu-world; in the\nthroat, a knowledge of Soma (moon) world; in the left eye, a knowledge of Shiva-world; in the head, a\nknowledge of Atala world; in the feet, a knowledge of Vitala world; in the ankles, a knowledge of\nNitala (rather Sutala) world; in the calves, a knowledge of Sutala (rather Talatala) world; in the knees, a\nknowledge of Mahatala world; in the thighs, a knowledge of Rasatala world; in the loins, a knowledge\nof Talatala (rather Patala) world; in the navel, a knowledge of Bhur (earth) world; in the stomach, a\nknowledge of Bhuvar world; in the heart, a knowledge of Suvar world; in the place above the heart, a\nknowledge of Mahar world; in the throat, a knowledge of Jana world; in the middle of the brows, a\nknowledge of Tapa world; in the head, a knowledge of Satya world. By conquering Dharma and\nAdharma, one knows the past and the future. By centring it on the sound of every creature, a\nknowledge of the cry (or language) of the animal is produced. By centring it on the Sanchita-Karma\n(past Karma yet to be enjoyed), a knowledge of one\u2019s previous births arises in him. By centring it on\nthe mind of another, a knowledge of the mind (or thoughts) of others is induced. By centring it on the\nKaya-Rupa (or form of the body), other forms are seen. By fixing it on the Bala (strength). The strength\nof persons like Hanuman is obtained. By fixing it on the sun, a knowledge of the worlds arises. By\nfixing it on the moon, a knowledge of the constellation is produced. By fixing it on the Dhruva (Polar\nstar) a perception of its motion is induced. By fixing it on his own (Self), one acquires the knowledge\nof Purusha; on the navel, he attains a knowledge of the Kaya-Vyuha (mystical arrangement of all the\nparticles of the body so as to enable a person to wear out his whole Karma in one life); on the well of\nthe throat, freedom from hunger and thirst arises; on the Kurma Nadi (which is situated in the well of\nthe throat), a firmness (of concentration) takes place. By fixing it on the Tara (pupil of the eye), he\nobtains the sight of the Siddhas (spiritual personages). By conquering the Akasa in the body, he is able\nto soar in the Akasa; (in short) by centring the mind in any place, he conquers the Siddhis appertaining\nto that place. Then comes Pratyahara, which is of five kinds. It is the drawing away of the organs from\nattaching themselves to the objects of senses. Contemplating upon everything that one sees as Atman is\nPratyahara. Renouncing the fruits of one\u2019s daily actions is Pratyahara. Turning away from all objects of\nsense is Pratyahara. Dharana in the eighteen important places (mentioned below) is Pratyahara, (viz.,)\nthe feet, the toes, the ankles, the calves, the knees, the thighs, the anus, the penis, the navel, the heart,\nthe well of the throat, the palate, the nose, the eyes, the middle of the brows, the forehead and the head\nin ascending and descending orders.\n70. Then (comes) Dharana. It is of three kinds, (viz.,) fixing the mind in the Atman, bringing the\nexternal Akasa into the Akasa of the heart and contemplating the five Murtis (forms of Devatas) in the\nfive elements - earth, Apas, fire, Vayu and Akasa.\n71. Then comes Dhyana. It is of two kinds, Saguna (with Gunas or quality) and Nirguna (without\nquality). Saguna is the meditation of a Murti. Nirguna is on the reality of Self.\n72. Samadhi is the union of the Jivatma (individual self) and the Paramatman (higher Self) without the\nthreefold state (viz., the knower, the known and the knowledge). It is of the nature of extreme bliss and\npure consciousness.\nThus ends the first chapter.\nCHAPTER - II\nThen the Brahma-Rishi Sandilya not obtaining the knowledge of Brahman in the four Vedas,\napproached the Lord Atharvan and asked him: \"What is it? Teach me the science of Brahman by which\nI shall obtain that which is most excellent.\"\n\nAtharvan replied: \"O Sandilya, Brahman is Satya, Vijnana and Ananta in which all this (world) is\ninterwoven, warp-wise and woof-wise, from which all originated and into which all are absorbed and\nwhich being known makes everything else known. It is without hands and feet, without eyes and ears,\nwithout tongue or without body and is unreachable and undefinable. From which, Vak (speech) and\nmind return, being unable to obtain (or reach) It. It is to be cognised by Jnana and Yoga. From which,\nPrajna of old sprang. That which is one and non-dual, that which pervades everything like Akasa,\nwhich is extremely subtle, without a blemish, actionless, Sat (be-ness) only, the essence, of the bliss of\nconsciousness, beneficent, calm and immortal and which is beyond. That is Brahman. Thou art That.\nKnow That by wisdom. He who is the one, the shining, the giver of the power of Atman, the\nomniscient, the Lord of all and the inner Soul of all beings, who lives in all beings, who is hidden in all\nbeings and the source of all beings, who is reachable only through Yoga and who creates, supports and\ndestroys everything - He is Atman. Know the several worlds in the Atman. Do not grieve, O knower of\nAtman, thou shalt reach the end of pains.\"\nThus ends the second chapter.\nCHAPTER - III\nThen Sandilya questioned Atharvan thus: \"From the Brahman that is OM, imperishable, actionless,\nbeneficial, Sat (be-ness) only and supreme, how dissolution this universe arise ? How does it exist in\nIt ? And how is it absorbed in It ? Please solve me this doubt.\"\nAtharvan replied: \"The Supreme Brahman, the Truth, is the imperishable and the actionless. Then from\nthe formless Brahman, three forms (or aspects) arose, (viz.,) Nishkala (partless), Sakala (with parts)\nand Sakala-Nishkala (with and without parts). That which is Satya, Vijnana and Ananda; That which is\nactionless, without any impurity, omnipresent, extremely subtle, having faces in every direction,\nundefinable and immortal - that is His Nishkala aspect. Maheshvara (the great Lord) who is black and\nyellow rules with Avidya, Mula-Prakriti or Maya that is red, white and black and that is co-existent\nwith him. This is his Sakala-Nishkala aspect. Then the Lord desired (or willed) by his spiritual wisdom\n(thus): May I become many ? May I bring forth ? Then from this Person who was contemplating and\nwhose desires are fulfilled, three letters sprang up. Three Vyahritis, the three-footed Gayatri, the three\nVedas, the three Devas, the three Varnas (colours or castes) and the three fires sprang. That Supreme\nLord who is endowed with all kinds of wealth, who is all pervading, who is situated in the hearts of all\nbeings, who is the Lord of Maya and whose form is Maya; He is Brahma; He is Vishnu; He is Rudra;\nHe is Indra; He is all the Devas; He is all the Bhutas (elements or beings); He only is before; He only is\nbehind; He only is on our left; He only is on our right; He only is below; He only is above; He only is\nthe all. That form of him as Dattatreya, who sports with his Sakti, who is kind to his devotees, who is\nbrilliant as fire, resembling the petals or a red lotus and is of four hands, who is mild and shines\nsinlessly - this is His Sakala form.\"\nThen Sandilya questioned Atharvan, \"O Lord, that which is Sat only and the essence of the bliss of\nconsciousness - why is He called Parabrahman?\"\nAtharvan replied: \"Because He increases Brihati and causes to increase everything (Brimhayati); so he\nis called Parabrahman.\nWhy is He called Atman ?\nSince He obtains (Apnoti) everything, since He takes back everything and since He is everything, so he\nis called Atman.\nWho is He called Maheshvara (the great Lord)?\n\nSince by the sound of the words Mahat-Isha (the great Lord) and by His own power, the great Lord\ngoverns everything.\nWhy is He called Dattatreya?\nBecause the Lord being extremely pleased with Atri (Rishi) who was performing a most difficult\npenance and who had expressed his desire to see Him who is light itself, offered Himself (Datta) as\ntheir son and because the woman Anasuya was his mother and Atri was his father.\nTherefore he who knows the (secret) meaning knows everything. He who always contemplates on the\nsupreme that It is himself becomes a knower of Brahman. Here these Shlokas (stanzas) occur (to\nmemory): 1-4: He who contemplates always the Lord of Lords and the ancient thus - as Dattatreya, the\nbeneficent, the calm, of the colour of sapphire, one who delights in his own Maya and the Lord who\nhas shaken off everything, as naked and as one whose whole body is besmeared with the holy ashes,\nwho has matted hair, who is the Lord of all, who has four arms, who is bliss in appearance, whose eyes\nare like full-blown lotus, who is the store of Jnana and Yoga, who is the spiritual instructor of all the\nworlds and who is dear to all the Yogins and one who is merciful towards His devotees, who is the\nwitness of all and who is worshipped by all the Siddhas is freed from all sins and will attain (the\nSpirit).\"\nOm Satyam (Truth).\nThus ends the third chapter.\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Sandilya Upanishad, included in the Atharva-Veda.",
    "Paingala": "\nPaingala Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nI-1. Then indeed Paingala approached Yajnavalkya as a disciple, and, having served him for twelve\nyears, said: Instruct me in regard to the supreme mystery of Aloneness.\nI-2. The eminent Yajnavalkya replied: Dear one, in the beginning this indeed existed. It was the\neternally free, immutable, everlastingly one, secondless Brahman, full of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss.\nI-3. In it existed the primordial and indefinable Prakriti, consisting of Gunas in a state of equipoise, red,\nwhite and dark, resembling (the existence of) water, silver, a man and outlines (respectively) in the\nmirage oyster-shell, a stump and a mirror; what was reflected in it was the Witness Consciousness.\nI-4. Having been modified, with the preponderance of Sattva, and named Avyakta (the Unmanifest), it\n(Prakriti) became the power of concealment. What was reflected in it became God Consciousness. He\nhas Maya under His control, is omniscient, is the initial cause of creation, sustenance and dissolution\n(of the world) and has the form of the sprouting world. He manifests the entire world dissolved in Him.\nDue to the power of the Karmas of living beings is the (world) spread out like this cloth and due to\ntheir exhaustion again is (the world) concealed. In Him alone does the entire world exist as a folded\ncloth.\nI-5.From the power of concealment controlled by God arose the Power of Projection called Mahat.\nWhat is reflected in it is the consciousness of Hiranyagarbha. He has the conceit of ownership as\nregards Mahat and has a body partly manifest and partly unmanifest.\nI-6. From the projective power controlled by Hiranyagarbha arose the gross power called the ego, with\nthe preponderance of Tamas. What was reflected in it was the consciousness of Virat. That Virat who\n\nhas conceit in the Ego, a manifest body, and is the Chief Person, Vishnu is the protector of all gross\nthings. From that Self (Virat) arose ether; from the ether, air; from air, fire; from fire, water; from\nwater, earth. These five root-elements are composed of the three Gunas.\nI-7. Desiring to create, that world-Cause (God), controlling the quality of Tamas, sought to render the\nsubtle root-elements gross. He bifurcated each of the extremely limited elements and again made (the\nhalves) four-fold and added each of the five halves to one-eighths of the other four. With those\nquintuplicated elements he created endless Crores of macrocosms and for each of these fourteen\nappropriate worlds and globular gross bodies fit for each planes of them all.\nI-8. Having divided into four the Rajas part of the five elements he made Prana with its five fold\nactivity from three parts of it. From the fourth part (of rajas) he fashioned the organ of action.\nI-9. Having divided into four their Sattva part, out of the combination of three of them, he made the\ninner organ with its five-fold activity. From the fourth, he made the organs of Cognition.\nI-10. From the combination of Sattva he made the guardians of sense-organs. He cast them, having\ncreated them into the macrocosm. Due to his command, conjured with the ego, the Virat protected the\ngross elements (of the cosmos). Commanded by him, Hiranyagarbha protected the subtle ones.\nI-11. In the cosmos they could not, without God, pulsate or act. He desired to vivify them. Splitting\nopen the macrocosm, the channels of Brahman, and the crowns of individuals, he entered into them.\nThough they were inert, like sentient (beings) they performed each its own functions.\nI-12. The omniscient Lord, conjoined with a streak of Maya, on entering the individual bodies, and\ndeluded by it, became the Jiva; due to self-identification with the three bodies (he) became both agent\nand reaper (of action\u2019s fruits). Possessing the attributes of wakefulness, dream, deep sleep, swoon and\ndeath, like a chain of buckets (attached to a water wheel) he becomes troubled and as it were is born\nand dies, revolving like a potter\u2019s wheel.\nII-1. Now Paingala asked Yajnavalkya: How did the omnipotent Lord of all worlds, the author of their\nmanifestation, sustenance and dissolution become Jiva ?\nII-2. Yajnavalkya replied: I shall speak distinguishing between the forms of the Jiva and of God,\nfollowing the generation of the gross, subtle and causal bodies. Listen with exclusive attention.\nEmploying parts of quintuplicated gross elements, the Lord made individual and collective gross,\nbodies, respectively. Earthy are the skull, skin, intestines, bones, flesh and nails. Watery are the blood,\nurine, saliva, perspiration and so forth. Fiery are hunger, thirst, heat, lassitude, sexual union, etc. Airy\nare the movements, the transporting, breathing, etc. Ethereal are lust, anger, etc. The gross body with\nskin, etc.; is a combination of all this, fashioned through deeds; (it is) the basis of states like childhood,\netc., conceit and numerous failings.\nII-3. Then he (God) manifested Prana (the Principle of life) from the non-quintuplicated aggregate of\nthe three Rajas parts of the gross elements. The modification of the life principle are the Prana, Apana,\nVyana, Udana and Samana. The subordinate functions of Prana are named Naga, Kurma, Krikara,\nDevadatta and Dhananjaya. Their bases are the heart, the anus, navel, throat and all the limbs. With the\nfourth part of the Rajas of Akasa, he manifested the organ of action. Its functions are (performed by)\nthe tongue, the hands, the feet, the anus and the generative organ. The objects of these are speech,\ngrasping, movement, excretion and (sex) enjoyment. Similarly from the aggregate of the three Sattva\nparts of the elements, he manifested the inner organ. Its functions are the mind, the intellect, thought\nand the ego. The objects of these are imagination, determination, memory, conceit and investigation.\nTheir bases are the throat, the mouth, the navel, the heart and the junction of the eye-brows. With the\nfourth part of the Sattva of the elements, he manifested the sense of Cognition. Its functions are the\nears, the skin, the eyes, the tongue and the nose. Their objects are sound, touch, form, taste and smell.\nThe overlords of the organs (of perception and action) are the directions, the wind, the sun, Prachetas,\nAsvins, Fire, Indra, Upendra, Death, the moon, Vishnu, Brahma and Sambhu.\nII-4. Now, there are five sheaths, that of food, of vital breaths, of mind, of knowledge and of bliss. The\n\nsheath of food comes into being from the essence of food alone, develops by it, and is dissolved in the\nearth that is predominantly of the nature of food. That alone is the gross body. The five breaths, Prana,\netc.; together with the five organs of actions constitute the sheath of vital breaths. The sheath of mind is\nthe mind together with the organs of cognition. The sheath of knowledge is the intellect together with\nthe organs of cognition. These three sheaths constitute the subtle body. The sheath of bliss is the\nknowledge of one\u2019s essence. This is the causal body.\nII-5. The eight-fold city (the total subtle body) consists of the five organs of cognition, the five organs\nof action, the five breaths, the five elements like ether, etc., the five-fold inner organ, desire, action and\nTamas.\nII-6. Vishva (is) the self of knowledge, a reflection of sat, the empirical (being), having conceit in the\ngross body of the waking state. The field of actions (or born of actions) is also a name of Vishva.\nII-7. By God\u2019s command, the Sutratman (Hiranyagarbha) entered the subtle body of the individual and\nsupervising the mind became the Taijasa. Taijasa is the appearance. Dream fashioned is a name of\nTaijasa.\nII-8. By God\u2019s command (the Self) with the adjunct of Maya together with the Unmanifest, entering the\nindividual causal body became Prajna. The Prajna is undifferentiated, real, \u2018Having conceit-in-deepsleep\u2019 is the name of Prajna.\nII-9. Texts like Tattvamasi declare the identity with Brahman of the real Jiva concealed by ignorance\nand part of the unmanifest; not of the other two, the empirical and the illusory Jivas (in the waking and\ndream-state).\nII-10. The Consciousness reflected in the inner organ participated in the three states. Merged in the\nstates of wakefulness, dream and deep sleep, like a chain of buckets attached to the water wheel, and\nafflicted, he (the Jiva) is as it were born and dead.\nII-11. Now there are five states \u2013 Wakefulness, dream, deep sleep, swoon and death. The wakeful state\nconsists in the cognition of objects like sound, etc.; by means of the organs of cognition like ears, etc.;\nwhen aided by the respective (guardian) deities. The Jiva stationed at the junction of the eye-brows and\npervading the whole (body) from the foot to the head becomes the agent of all kinds of activities like\ntilling and heaving. Also the reaper of their respective fruits. Migrating to the other world(s) alone he\nreaps the fruit of (his) activities. Tired due to activities, like an emperor, he takes to the way leading to\nthe inner chamber (a new body).\nII-12. When the instruments of (cognition and action) cease to operate, the dream state comes into\nbeing in which there is knowledge of objects and their cognition due to the half-awakened impressions\nof the waking state. There, Vishva himself, due to the cessation of empirical activities, moving in the\nsystem of nerves and becoming Taijasa, enjoys freely the rarity of the world consisting of latent\nimpressions which he illumines with his light.\nII-13. The instrument of deep sleep is mind alone. Just as a bird, exhausted by random flights, folds its\nwings and moves towards its nest, so the Jiva, too, sporting in the spheres of wakefulness and dream\nand exhausted, plunges into ignorance and enjoys its own bliss.\nII-14. The (state of) swoon is like that of death with the sense organs stirring due to fear and\nunconsciousness when struck with a club, stick, etc., accidentally.\nII-15. Different from the states of wakefulness, dream, deep sleep and swoon and occasioning fear to\nall Jivas from Brahma down to a clump (of grass, etc.,) and resulting in the fall of the body is the state\nof death.\nII-16. Withdrawing the organs of action and cognition and the vital breaths corresponding to varied\nobjects, and attended by desires and actions, and enveloped in ignorance and (the subtle) elements, the\nJiva goes to another world. Due to the ripening of the fruits of prior actions, like a worm caught up in a\nwhirl pool (the Jiva) now wins rest.\nII-17. As a result of past good deeds, at the end of many lives, men seek liberation. Then resorting to a\nteacher of Self-realization and (faithfully) serving him long one inquiries into bondage and liberation.\n\nII-18. Bondage results from lack of inquiry; liberation results from inquiry. Therefore investigate at all\ntimes. One\u2019s own nature may be determined through superimposition and its repudiation. Therefore\nalways inquire (into the nature of) the individual Self and the supreme Self. When the state of Jiva and\nthat of the world are sublated, Brahman alone, non-different from the inner Self, remains.\nIII-1-2. Then Paingala said to Yajnavalkya: Set forth the explanation of the major text(s) [Mahavakyas]. Yajnavalkya replied: Thou art That; Thou That art; Thou Brahman art; I am Brahman \u2013 One\nshould meditate thus.\nIII-3. The expressed sense of the word \u2018tat\u2019 is the world-cause, marked by \u2018other-ness\u2019 (mediacy),\nhaving Being, Consciousness and Bliss as his characteristics, Maya as his adjunct and omniscience,\netc., as his features. The very same with awareness mixed up with the inner sense, the object of the Inotion, is the expressed meaning of \u2018tvam\u2019. Rejecting the adjuncts of the supreme (God) and the Jiva,\nviz.: Maya and avidya, the indicated sense of tat and tvam is Brahman, non-different from the inner\nSelf.\nIII-4. \u2018Hearing\u2019 is investigation into the import of propositions like \u2018That Thou art\u2019 and \u2018I am\nBrahman\u2019. Reflection is the exclusive dwelling on the content of what has been heard. Meditation is the\nfixing of the mind one-pointedly on the reality, made doubtless through investigation and reflection.\nConcentration, resembling a flame in a windless spot, is the thought (chitta) whose content is solely the\nobject meditated, exclusive of the agent, and the act, of meditation.\nIII-5. Then (mind\u2019s) modifications referring to the Self, though shooting up, remain uncognised; they\nare only inferred from memory. By this (Samadhi) alone are dissolved Crores of deeds accumulated in\nthe course of beginningless transmigratory existence. Through skilful practice, thence, then, flow, in a\nthousand ways, streams of nectar. Therefore, the best knowers of Yoga call (this) Concentration\ndharmamegha, cloud of virtues. When the meshes of latent impressions are entirely obliterated by\nvirtue of it and the accumulation of deeds, good and evil, pulled up by their roots, the proposition\n(whose content was) earlier mediated on generates unimpeded and immediate realization (resembling,\nin its certitude) the gooseberry in the palm (of one\u2019s hand). Then one becomes liberated in life.\nIII-6. God desired the non-quintuplication of the quintuplicated elements. Leading the effected\nmacrocosm and the worlds included in it to their causal state, unifying the subtle organs of action, vital\nbreaths, organs of cognition and the four-fold inner sense, reducing all elemental (effects) to the fivefold cause, (he) dissolves in (due) order the earth in water, water in fire, fire in air, air in ether, ether in\nthe ego, the ego in the Mahat, the Mahat in the unmanifest and the unmanifest in the Spirit (Purusha).\nDue to the dissolution of the adjuncts, Virat, Hiranyagarbha and God are dissolved in the supreme Self.\nIII-7. Having become non-quintuplicated through the attenuation of (the accumulated) deeds and the\nripening of good deeds, and one with the subtle (body), returning to the cause and its cause, the gross\nbody generated by deeds done through the quintuplicated gross elements becomes non-quintuplicated\nand gets dissolved in the immutable inner Self. Vishva, taijasa and Prajna dissolve in the same due to\nthe dissolution of their adjuncts.\nIII-8. The microcosm consumed in the fire of knowledge together with (its) causes is dissolved in the\nsupreme Self. Therefore the Brahmana should concentratedly dwell on the identity (of the contents) of\nthe terms tat and tvam. Thence, when the clouds are dispelled as the sun (shines forth), the Self is\nmanifested.\nIII-9-10. Meditating on the Self, of the size of a thumb, in the centre (of the heart ?) like a smokeless\nflame, meditate on the illumining Self in the centre, immutable and immortal. The silent sage\nLiberated-in-life, sits meditating till sleep, till death; he is the blessed one who has performed his duty.\nIII-11. Giving up the status of Liberation-in-life, when one\u2019s body is consumed by time, he reaches the\nstatus of disembodied liberation like the wind becoming stirless.\nIII-12. That immortal and certain (one), devoid of sound, touch, form, taste or smell, without beginning\nand end, beyond the Mahat, alone remains without impurity and suffering.\n\nIV-1. Then Paingala asked Yajnavalkya: How does a knower (Jnanin) act ? How does he stay in\nrepose ?\nIV-2. Yajnavalkya replied: One seeking liberation, having acquired freedom from egotism, etc.; takes\n21 generations (of his ancestors and descendants) across the (sea of samsara). The knower of Brahman\nby himself alone does so 101 generations.\nIV-3. Know the Self to be the rider in the chariot; the body verily to be the chariot; the intellect to be\nthe charioteer and the mind to be the reins.\nIV-4. The senses, the wise say, are the horses; the objects are what they range over; the hearts are the\nmoving many-storeyed mansions.\nIV-5. The great sages aver that the Self combined with sense-organs and mind is the experiencer.\nTherefore in the heart, immediately, is Narayana well-established.\nIV-6. Upto (the exhaustion of) the operative deeds, the homeless liberated Self, behaves like the Slough\nof a snake, like the moon (in the sky).\nIV-7. Shedding the body in a holy spot or (may be) in the home of an eater of dog\u2019s flesh, (the liberated\none) attains Isolation.\nIV-8. Afterwards, make an offering of his body to the cardinal points or bury (his body). Mendicancy is\nprescribed for the male, never for the other.\nIV-9. No observance of (the period of) pollution, no burning (of the corpse), no offering of rice balls or\nof water, no fortnightly rites (are laid down) for a mendicant who has become Brahman.\nIV-10. There is no burning of what is (already) consumed, just as there is no cooking of what is\n(already) cooked. For one whose body is consumed in the fire of knowledge there is neither ceremonial\nrice offering nor any (other) rite (of obsequies).\nIV-11. As long as the adjuncts (body, etc.,) persist, let one wait upon the teacher. Let him treat the wife\nof the teacher and his children as he does the teacher himself.\nIV-12. When with the knowledge, \u2018I am That !\u2019 \u2018I am That\u2019 -- I, whose mind is pure essence, is pure\nSpirit, is long-suffering \u2013 wisdom is won, when the object of knowledge, the supreme Self, is\nestablished in the heart; when the body is dissolved in the state of achieved Peace, then one becomes\ndestitute of the luminous mind and intellect.\nIV-13. Of what use is water to one who has had his fill of ambrosia ? Similarly, (for one) who has\nknown his Self, of what use are the Vedas ? No duty remains for the Yogin who has had his fill of the\nambrosia of knowledge. If duty be there, he is no knower of Truth. Though stationed at a distance, he is\nnot distant; though embodied, he is disembodied; he is the omnipresent inner self.\nIV-14. Making the heart pure, contemplating the well-being (of all), one must experience supreme joy\nin the thought, \u2018I am the supreme, the All\u2019.\nIV-15. As there is non-difference when water is poured in water, milk in milk and ghee in ghee, so is\nthe case with the individual Self and the supreme Self.\nIV-16. When the body is burned by knowledge and knowledge becomes infinite in form, then the\nknower consumes the bondage of Karma in the fire of Brahman-Knowledge.\nIV-17. Thence (follows the state of) the holy non-dual(Reality), named the Supreme Lord, like unto the\nstainless sky. Self\u2019s nature, abiding without adjuncts, is as (that of) water mixed with water.\nIV-18. Like the ether the Self in the subtle body. The inner Self like air is not perceived. That stirless\ninner Self perceives the external (manifold) with the torch of (objective) knowledge.\nIV-19. The knower, dead, no matter due to whatever (form of) death, is dissolved (in Brahman that is)\nlike the all-pervasive sky.\nIV-20. This dissolution he knows in truth as of the pot-space (in the infinite space). He attains (the\nstatus of) the self-sustained light of all-pervasive knowledge.\nIV-21. Standing on one foot, let man do austerities for a 1000 years; but (that austerity) is less than one\nsixteenth of this Yoga of meditation.\n\nIV-22. This is knowledge; this is to be known; one wishes to know all that. Were he to live (even) for a\n1000 years, he would not reach the end of the Shastras.\nIV-23. What should be known is just the Imperishable; (but) life is fleeting. Avoiding the labyrinths of\nShastras, meditate on the Truth (alone).\nIV-24. Action are endless \u2013 purification, mutterings, (of holy names), sacrifices, pilgrimage to holy\nplaces. These (are valid) only till Truth is won.\nIV-25. As regards the great-souled ones, the sure cause of liberation is (the knowledge) \u2018I am\nBrahman\u2019. The two words determining bondage and liberation are \u2018mine\u2019 and \u2018not mine\u2019.\nIV-26. The import of \u2018mine\u2019 binds the living being; he is liberated by that of \u2018not mine\u2019. When the mind\nis dementalised, no longer is duality cognised.\nIV-27. When dementalisation is achieved, That becomes the supreme status. Wherever, then, the mind\ngoes, there, verily, is the supreme status.\nIV-28. Thus, there, everywhere, is Brahman well-established. For one who holds \u2018I am not Brahman\u2019\nno liberation is possible; (it is as futile) as striking the sky with clenched fists or a hungry man\u2019s\nchewing the chaff.\nIV-29. Whoso studies the Upanishad as a rule (every day) is purified by fire (as it were); by air; by the\nsun; by Vishnu; by Rudra. He has bathed in all sacred waters. He is versed in all the Vedas; has\nperformed all the sacred rites taught by all the Vedas. He has ritually muttered Lacs of Itihasas and\nPuranas and one Lac times Rudra\u2019s (tantras). He has muttered a million times the sacred syllable, OM.\nHe redeems ten generations of his line, past and future. He purifies the rows of diners of which he is a\nnumber. He becomes great. He is purged of the sins of Brahmin-slaughter, drink, stealth, adultery with\n(even a) teacher\u2019s spouse and of association with those who are guilty of these.\nIV-30. That supreme Status of Vishnu spread out, like an eye, in the sky, the enlightened ones always\nbehold.\nIV-31. The wise, ever vigilant and diligent in praise richly glorify That supreme Status of Vishnu.\nIV-32. OM-Truth \u2013 This is the secret teaching.\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Paingalopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",

Mendicant monks desiring liberation are of four kinds: the Kutichaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa and\nParamahamsa.\n2. The Kutichakas (hut-dwelling ascetics) such as (the sages of yore like) Gautama, Bharadvaja,\nYajnavalkya and Vasistha, subsist on eight mouthfuls of food and seek liberation alone by the path of\nyoga.\n3. Next the Bahudaka ascetics (remaining mainly in a holy place of sacred waters) who carry a threefold emblematic staff (tridanda) and water vessel and wear tuft, sacred thread and ochre coloured\ngarment. Avoiding wine and meat, they subsist on eight mouthfuls of food secured as alms from the\nhouses of Brahmana sages and seek liberation alone in the path of Yoga.\n4. Then come the Hamsa ascetics who shelter for one night in a village, five nights in a town and seven\nnights or more in a holy place. Subsisting on cow\u2019s urine and other products from the cow and always\naddicted to the chandrayana vow, they seek liberation alone in the path of Yoga.\n5. Then there are the Paramahamsa ascetics (such as the sages of yore like) Samvartaka, Aruni,\nSvetaketu, Jadabharata, Dattatreya, Suka, Vamadeva and Harita, who live on eight mouthfuls of food\nand seek liberation alone in the path of Yoga. They take shelter under the shade of trees, in deserted\nhouses or in a cemetery. They may wear a dress or be unclad. They observe neither Dharma nor\nAdharma (i.e. they are above the laws of the land). They are not conscious of profit and loss of\nanything. They discard the doctrines of Visishtadvaita (propounded by Ramanuja), the Suddha Dvaita\n(of Madhvacharya) and the Asuddha Dvaita. Considering equally a pebble, stone and gold they receive\n\nalms from (person of) all castes and see the Atman alone everywhere. Unclad, unaffected by pairs (of\nopposites, heat and cold, etc.,) receiving no gifts, solely adhering to pure meditation, established in the\nAtman alone, receiving alms at the prescribed time for sustaining life, (taking shelter during nights) in a\ndeserted house, temple, hay stack, ant-hill, shade of a tree, potter\u2019s hut, a place where ritual fire is kept,\nsandy bank of a river, a mountain thicket or cavity, a hollow in a tree, the vicinity of a water fall, or a\npiece of clean ground, they are well on the way to realize Brahman; with pure mind, they give up their\nbodies in the state of renunciation as a Paramahamsa. They are indeed the Paramahamsas (as they\nbecome absorbed in Brahman). Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Bhikshukopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Mahat": "\nMaha Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! Let my limbs and speech, Prana, eyes, ears, vitality\nAnd all the senses grow in strength.\nAll existence is the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nMay I never deny Brahman, nor Brahman deny me.\nLet there be no denial at all:\nLet there be no denial at least from me.\nMay the virtues that are proclaimed in the Upanishads be in me,\nWho am devoted to the Atman; may they reside in me.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nI-1-4. Then we shall expound the Mahopanishad. They say Narayana was alone. There were not\nBrahma, Shiva, Waters, Fire and Soma, Heaven and Earth, Stars, Sun and Moon. He could not be\nhappy.\nFrom the (desire of) the Paramatman, the Yajnastoma (hymn known as Avyakta) is said to have arisen.\nI-5-6. In it arose fourteen Purushas (Brahman, Vishnu, Rudra, Isana, Sadashiva and nine Prajapatis like\nDaksha), one maiden (Mula-Prakriti), the ten organs (five of perception and five of action), Mind as the\neleventh, bright intellect as the 12th, ego as the 13th, Prana as 14th, Atma as 15th, Buddhi, Kama,\nKarma and Tamas, five Tanmatras, along with gross elements and the Being was the 25th (Sutratman).\nEmploying him in creation, the supreme Being remained detached. From him do all things come into\nbeing.\nI-7. Again, Narayana, desiring something else, thought. From his forehead a person arose with three\neyes and a trident, having glory, fame, truth, celibacy, austerity, detachment, mind, lordship, seven\nVyahritis (Bhur etc.,) along with Pranava, Rik and other Vedas, all metres is his body \u2013 so, he is the\ngreat Lord.\nI-8-9. Then again, desiring something else, he thought \u2013 From his forehead, sweat fell and became the\n\nwide waters: from it a bright golden egg \u2013 in it was born the four-headed Brahma facing east. Narayana\nbecame the Vyahriti, Bhur, the chandas Gayatri, the Rig-Veda and the deity, Agni. Facing west he\nbecame Bhuvar, the chandas Tristubh, the Yajur-Veda and deity, Vayu. Facing north, he became\nVyahriti Suvar, Jagati-chandas, Sama-Veda and the deity Surya. Facing south he became Mahar,\nchandas Anustubh, Atharva-Veda and Soma.\nI-10-13. (Meditate upon) the god of a thousand heads and eyes, source of cosmic well-being, beyond\nall, eternal Narayana \u2013 the universe subsists in Him. Like a lotus calyx, the human heart hangs down,\ndripping drops of cold water for sustaining life. In its midst is a great flame, facing everywhere, subtle\nand facing upwards; the great being is present \u2013 He is Brahma, Shiva, Indra, undying and self-shining.\nII-1-11. Suka, of great lustre, devoted to Natural Bliss, the prince of sages, realised Truth even at birth\n(without instruction). So also a person may get certain knowledge of the self by himself by long selfanalysis. (This is because) the self is beyond description, un-realisable (by worldly means) by the mind\nand the sense organs; Pure Bliss, atomic, subtler then even ether. The millions of particles undergo\ngeneration, subsistence and dissolution inside the supreme Being by rotation of the power.\nThe supreme being is Ether because there is nothing outside it and yet not the ether, because it is all\npure consciousness \u2013 it is nothing which can be pointed out (specified such and such) as a thing, reality\netc.\nHe is conscious, being lustrous, yet like rock, because he cannot be (normally) known; causing the\npicture-like awakening (existence) of the world in himself, the pure ether.\nThis cosmos is only the manifestation of that being; there is nothing other than that; the differences in\nthe universe are also his manifestation.\nPresent everywhere, connected with every thing, yet He does not move as there is nowhere to go; He\ndoes not exist as there is nowhere (substratum) to exist, yet exists because he is Existence by nature.\nBrahman is knowledge, Bliss and the resort (source) of the giver of Jivanmukti. Giving up of all mental\ndesires is the way (to that knowledge). The wise say that the understanding of that Being is the absence\nof worldly conceptions. The dissolution and creation of the universe are due to the contraction and\nexpansion, respectively, of the Power.\nThe basis of Vedantic statements, yet beyond words, It is \u2018I Reality, knowledge, bliss and nothing else\u2019.\nII-12-13. Suka knew all this by his own subtle intellect; then remained with his mind ceaselessly rapt in\nit.\nHe did not have the conception that the Atman is real; his mind simply turned away from worldly\ntemptations, the many (material) worldly enjoyments which break very much, like the satisfied Chataka\nbird from torrent water.\nII-14-37. (He knew all but out of respect for tradition, passed at this stage).\nOnce Suka of pure knowledge asked with devotion, of his father Vyasa, the seer seated alone at Meru\nmountain, \u2018O Seer, how did this elaborate (pomp of) worldly life arise, how does this become\ndissolved, how much and when ?\u2019\nBeing thus asked, Vyasa instructed everything to his son.\nHaving already known all this, Suka did not value the verbal statement.\nSage Vyasa, knowing the son\u2019s thought said, \u2018I do not know the truth; you can know all from Janaka,\nthe king of Mithila who knows it correctly. Being told this, Suka went from there, to the earth and the\ncity of Videha, ruled by Janaka.\nHe was announced to Janaka by the ushers \u2018O King, Suka, the son of Vyasa, waits at the entrance\u2019.\nDesiring of knowing Suka, Janaka said \u2018Let him wait\u2019 and tarried for seven days. Then he permitted\nhim into the court and Janaka regaled Suka with women and other luxuries. They did not attract Suka,\njust as gentle breeze cannot shake a mountain. He simply remained pure, like the full moon, equable,\nsilent and composed. Janaka looked at him and bowed knowing his nature. He said \u2018You have (adjured)\nall worldly actions and for all your desires, what (more) do you desire ? Suka replied \u2018this grandiose\nworld \u2013 how did this arise and how dissolved ? Janaka narrated all correctly \u2013 the same as was spoken\n\nby father Vyasa.\n\u2018I myself knew this already; the same was told to me by my father; also by you, most eloquent speaker;\nthis is also the matter seen in the Shastras. The mass of mental fancies dies away by the death of the\nfancies; worldly life is also buried away \u2013 this is certain. So great-armed Janaka, pray tell me the truth,\nfirmly \u2013 the world gets peace for the reeling mind from you\u2019.\n(Janaka) replied): \u2018O Suka, listen to what I speak, the details of knowledge, the essence of wisdom, by\nknowing which one can get the status of Liberation in life\u2019.\nII-38-41. When there is generated a wiping away of visible phenomena by the mind realizing that there\nis no (real) visible object, then arises the great joy of Nirvana (Extinction \u2013 Liberation).\nThe best, total adjuration of mental impressions (tendencies) is said by the good (people) to be\nliberation \u2013 it is a pure procedure (whereas) those people whose tendencies are (not given up but)\npurified, not subject to the danger of re-birth \u2013 these wise ones are said to be the enlightened,\nLiberated-in-life. Strong (intense) brooding over objects is said to be bondage; its thinning out is, Oh\nBrahman, liberation.\nII-42-62. He is said to be \u2018Liberated while living\u2019 who has lost taste for enjoyment by means of\npenance etc., and no other cause.\nWho does not rejoice, nor languish, being detached when joy and grief befall (him) according to time\n(destiny);\nWho is untouched in the mind, by exaltation, anger, fear, lust and meanness;\nWho gives up (as if) playfully, the egotist tendency and remains giving up brooding;\nWho is free from desire and non-desire as he is introvert and behaves as in deep sleep;\nWho is seated delighting in the spirit, replete, pure in mind having got excellent repose and desires\nnothing in the material world and lives without unction;\nWho is un-smeared in the region of the heart with (objects of) knowledge and whose consciousness is\nnot inert;\nWho performs without expectation, likes and dislikes (actions) (acts of) joy and grief, virtue and vice,\nsuccess and failure;\nWho is silent, egoless, prideless, avoiding jealousy and does actions without agitation;\nWho exists like a detached onlooker and functions without attachment and desire everywhere;\nWho has given up internally all of Dharma and Adharma, thought and desire;\nWho has given up fully the (worldly) view;\nWho eats with equal detachment what is bitter, sour, salty, astringent, seasoned and unseasoned;\nWho has given up Dharma and Adharma, joy and grief, death and birth;\nWho, free from tension and joy, does not get depressed or elated, with a pure intellect;\nWho has given up all desires, all doubts, all conation, all rigid thoughts;\nWho is equal towards birth, existence and death, rise and fall.\nWho does not dislike or hanker after anything and enjoys incidental pleasure.\nWhose thought of worldly life has quietened down, who has aspects and yet is aspect-less, having mind\n\u2013 yet mindless.\nWho is active towards all objects, yet is desireless as if they are alien objects, is full in spirit.\nII-63-69. He gives up the state of Jivanmukta when this body is consigned to time (death) and enters\nthe state of Adehamukta (liberated without body), like wind which does not move.\nSuch a person does not rise or set, is neither real nor unreal, nor is he far away, nor \u2018I\u2019 nor \u2018another\u2019.\nOther, than him, there is no lustres nor darkness which is steady and profound, ineffable and\nunmanifest. Not empty vacuum, not having form, neither visible nor vision; nor a mass of creations but\nexisting infinitely.\nUndesignated in nature, fuller than the fullest, neither real nor unreal, neither being nor coming into\nbeing, pure consciousness; not the Chaitya (world created by mind), endless, ageless, auspicious,\nhaving no beginning, middle or end, having no ailment in mind or body. That which is considered as\n\nthe vision amidst the seer, seeing and object of seeing. O sage, there is surely nothing beyond this.\nII-70-73. It is known by yourself as well as heard from a preceptor: \u2013 one is bound by one\u2019s own fancy\nand released by being rid of it \u2013 detachment towards enjoyment of all visible (external) objects has\narisen (in you); all that is to be got has been got by you with a perfect mind; you feel (erred) in regard\nto your own nature but now being liberated, give up error; you see that you are Brahman itself beyond\nwhat is external and internal \u2013 you see but you do not see; you are the sole and perfect onlooker (uninvolved).\nII-74-77. Suka, reposed silently (passively) in the Supreme Being in the own normal state, devoid of\ngrief, fear and strain. Then he went to the peak of Meru mountain, unimpeded, for trance. There, for\nthousands of years he remained in \u2018unqualified trance\u2019 and attained rest in himself, like a flame without\noil.\nPurified of the blemish of manifold thought, in the pristine and pure condition, he became one, with all\n(worldly) tendencies melting away like water-drop in the ocean.\nIII-1-15. A lad, Nidagha, prince of seers and enlightened, permitted by his father to go on a pilgrimage,\nhad ablution in three and a half Crores of sacred places, then told Ribhu about himself. \u2018After bathing\nin so many places an enquiry (question) has arisen there in my mind:\nThe world is born only to die and dies only to be reborn \u2013 all the actions of the moving and unmoving\nthings are ephemeral; Things such are sources of splendour are sinful and give place to all calamities;\nunconnected with each other, like iron-stakes, they come together, only by mental fancy. I have lost\ntaste in various things, like a traveller in deserts my mind is tormented as to how this suffering will die\ndown; riches please me not but give only cycles of worries just as houses with children and women\ncause danger.\nThis (material) glory in the world is delicate, cause only delusion, does not give happiness. Life is\nunsteady like a drop of water hanging on to the top of a tender leaf; like an insane person it goes away,\nleaving the body suddenly. Life causes strain to those whose mind is shattered by contact with the\npoison from the snake of worldly objects and who lack mature discrimination of the self.\nIt is (possible) reasonable to envelop wind and to cut into (empty) space, to string together watery\nwaves but not give up attachment to (worldly) life.\n(In contrast) by attaining Brahman, what is to be got is got, which causes no grief; it is the place of\nhighest joy.\nEven trees live, so do animals and birds \u2013 only he (really) lives, whose mind is sustained by\ncontemplation; the others who have no (spiritual) rebirth are only old donkeys.\nShastra is a burden to one who lacks (spiritual) discrimination, knowledge is a burden to one attached\n(to life); mind is a burden to one without security, body is a burden to one ignorant of the self.\nII-16-26. From ego does danger arise, so do bad mental ailments and desire \u2013 there is no enemy more\ndangerous than Ego; whatever in the moving and unmoving world was enjoyed by Ego \u2013 all that is\nunreal; only freedom from Ego is real. The mind runs hither and tither, in vain and with zeal, like a dog\nin the village. O Brahman, I have been made inert by the pursuit of thirst and eaten by my mind as by a\ndog.\nContainment of the mind is impossible even by drinking up the ocean uprooting Meru and eating fire.\nMind is the cause of objects; when it exists, the three worlds exist; when it does not, so do they, so it\nshould be cured with effort.\nWhatever wealth of merit I acquire, that Thirst cuts down, like a mouse cutting a string. Thirst is a\nfickle monkey \u2013 it sets foot in impassable places, hankers after fruits even when filled with them; never\nrests long in a place.\nThroat is a bee in the lotus-heart. One moment, it goes to Patala; another, the sky; and another, it hovers\nin the bush of space; of all the griefs of worldly life, only thirst gives the longest grief; a person (wellguarded) in the harem it involves in great trouble.\n\nAbandonment of brooding is the (preventive) chant for the cholera of Thirst.\nII-27-38. There is nothing as pitiable as the body, low and meritless; it exults over a little and suffers\nover a little. The body is the great abode of the house-holder i.e. the Ego. Let it roll about or be steady \u2013\nwhat is it to me, O Preceptor !\nThis body pleases me not \u2013 the senses (animals) are bound by six ropes (vices) \u2013 in its yard, Ego leaps\nabout, it is crowded with the servants \u2013 the mind. It is frightening with the entrance held by the monkey\n(tongue) \u2013 in it are seen the (bared) teeth and bones. Tell me, what is attractive in the body which is\nmade of blood and flesh, in and out, and which is only to perish \u2013 let him trust the body, who sees\nsteadiness in lightnings, autumn clouds, and cities in the sky (illusions). Childhood is the abode of fear\nfrom the teacher, mother, father, other people and older children.\nOne is overwhelmed by the goblin of lust which exists in the cave of one\u2019s mind and causes many\ndelusions. Slaves, sons, women, relatives and friends laugh at a man shaken by old age as at a mad\nman. Desire is full of the defect of helplessness, grows long in old age, the sole friend of all danger and\nconfuse foment is the heart.\nThe attribution of happiness to worldly life \u2013 even this is cut by time like grass by a rat. Time tries to\npossess selfishly (every thing from) grass and dust (to) Indra and gold, which is the dust of Meru \u2013\ndestroys all and all the three worlds are occupied by it.\nIII-39-48. What is auspicious about woman \u2013 a puppet of flesh \u2013 moved by a machine in the cage of the\nbody \u2013 having nerves, bones and knots ?\nWhy are you deluded; separate the skin, flesh, blood and tears and then look at the body. Is it\nattractive ?\nThe pearl necklace on the breast is like the current of Ganga on Meru (fleeting and ephemeral) \u2013 the\nsame breast is eaten by dogs at the due time like a lump of food, in the cemetery and corners of the\ndirections.\nWomen are the flame of sin, have the soot of hair, pleasing to the eye but not to be touched; they burn\nman like grass.\nWomen are the fuel lovely, yet harmful, of the fires of all blazing at a distance whether they have taste\n(attachment) or not.\nWomen are the traps to catch the birds \u2013 men, spread by the hunter, Manmatha, the lump of bait, the\nstring of wickedness to men who are the fish in the pond of birth (life) and moving in the mud of mind.\nI will have none of this woman who is the basket of all defects \u2013 gems \u2013 the chain of misery. Only he\nwith a woman has desire for enjoyment; where is enjoyment for one who has no woman ? Giving up\nwomen means giving up the world; by this one shall be happy.\nIII-49-54. Even the Quarters (like North) are not seen, regions give other (wrong) instruction; even the\noceans and the stars dry up, even the permanent becomes impermanent, even Yogins (Siddhas) perish,\ndemons and others decay; Brahma is reduced (to nothing), the unborn Vishnu too; Shiva becomes nonexistent, the lords of the quarters decay. Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra and all classes of creatures run towards\ndestruction, like water-streams towards the marine fire. Dangers come for a moment, so does wealth;\nbirth and death are only for a moment \u2013 everything dies. The brave ones are killed by those not brave \u2013\na hundred are killed by one. Poison changes its scope (effect) \u2013 poison is not poison !\nIII-55-57. Objects (of the world) destroy (only) one more birth, poison destroys life only once; it is\ntime my mind is burnt in the forest fire of defects. Desires for enjoyment do not flash even in the\nillusory fatamorgana; so, oh preceptor, waken me quickly with the knowledge of truth. If you do not, I\nshall take to silence, without pride and jealousy, contemplating Vishnu with the mind like one turned\ninto a painting.\nIV-1-24. Nidagha, there is nothing else to be known by you, you are the best of the of the enlightened \u2013\nyou know by your intellect, with God\u2019s grace \u2013 I shall wipe away the error caused by the impurity of\nthe mind:\n\nControl of inner and outer senses, enquiry, contentment and the fourth, contact with good people \u2013\nresort to one at least of these giving up everything, with all effort \u2013 when one is achieved, the others\nalso are achieved.\nOne shall develop wisdom only at first; first liberation from worldly life, by means of scripture, contact\nwith good people, penance and self-control. One\u2019s own experience (of the self), Shastra and the\npreceptor form one statement (they yield a single purpose) by practising (the teachings of) which the\nself is ever looked at (realized).\nIf you do (achieve) every moment, the avoidance of the sustained fancy and desire, then you will have\nreached the sacred, mindless state. Samadhi is said to be the freedom of the mind from agency\n(activity). That itself is oneness, that is the highest and auspicious joy.\nYou should remain, like a dumb, blind and deaf person, giving up with your mind, the thought of all\nthings as the self.\nThe vision got through words of (Vedanta) that you are composed, unborn, beginningless and endless,\nshining, taste (bliss) alone, devoid of symptoms of mind \u2013 all this is for the (lower) knowledge and\nwasteful \u2013 only Om is real.\nAll the visible things in the world are nothing more than the consciousness without vibration \u2013\ncontemplate this.\nOr, with mind ever enlightened and performing worldly functions, you remain knowing the oneness of\nthe self, like the calm ocean.\nOnly the knowledge of Truth is the fire to the grass of mental impressions \u2013 this is said to be Samadhi,\nnot mere silence.\nJust as the world is active when the much desired sun has arisen (Mani \u2013 gem of the day, the sun), so\nalso do the creatures of the world, when the supreme reality is present. So, oh sage, the agentship and\nnon-agentship in the self arise: -- the spirit is a non-agent when there is no desire \u2013 an agent by his\nmere presence.\nThese two exist in the Supreme Being \u2013 agency and non-agency \u2013 Resort to it firmly which is the\n(ultimate) cause of the two. So, by the thoughts, well kindled, that I am always a non-agent, the\nremains only the state of equality called the supreme immortality.\nListen, O Nidagha, there are born in the world, men of noble qualities in the Nirvikalpa Samadhi, ever\nin the ascendant and happy like (autumnal) moons in the sky; not depressed during danger, like a gold\nlotus at night, nor aspiring beyond what is destined, delighting in the path of the good people. They\nshine through this firm (personality) with merits in the friendship; even-minded and reconciled,\npleasing, ever good in conduct. They are within limits like the ocean, placid in mind, do not give up\ndiscipline, like the sun.\nA wise person should enquire fully \u2018What am I ? How did this blemish of Samsara develop ?\u2019 One\nshould not take to wrong deeds nor live with a low person. Death, the killer of all, should not be looked\nup in mockery. One should look only at the pure consciousness, avoiding the body, the bone, flesh and\nblood which are inauspicious, the consciousness being the string that holds together all the creatures\nlike a necklace. Pursuing what is acceptable and avoiding totally what is not \u2013 this is the (proper)\nnature (attitude) of the mind. The seer shall be rid of grief knowing that he is Brahman with his own\nrealization by the path prescribed by the preceptor.\nIV-25. Enlightenment arises in the state of detachment wherein the fall of a hundred sharp swords is\nborne like strokes with lilies, burning with fire like drenching with snow, charcoal like sandalwood,\nendless fall of arrows like a fall of cool water to relieve summer heat, cutting one\u2019s own head like\nhappy sleep, the deprivation of speech like silence, deafness like a blessing.\nIV-26-27. The self as always observed by the practice of realization which arises from the instruction of\nthe preceptor. Just as the directions once again as before the delusion, so the world \u2013 delusion goes\naway destroyed by knowledge \u2013 consider this.\nIV-28. Riches do not help, nor friends nor kinsmen, nor the strain of the body, nor resorting to sacred\n\nwaters and temples, but only through the conquest of the mind is that condition reached.\nIV-29-38. All the miseries, hankerings, unbearable mental pain are lost in people with a calm mind, like\ndarkness in the sun. All creatures subside (attain calmness) in a serene person like children mischievous\nor soft, in their mother.\nNot by drinking elixirs, nor by the embrace of wealth does a person get so much joy as by inner peace.\nHe is said to be a serene person, who does not exult or feel depressed on hearing, touching, eating,\nseeing and knowing the good or the bad.\n\u00b7 Whose mind is not agitated, clear like the moon\u2019s disc, in death, festival as well as in battle.\nOnly the serene person shines among ascetics, knowers, sacrificers, kings, men of strength and of\nvirtue.\nThe calm persons are great who have attained contentment with the drink of Amrita and delight in the\nself.\nHe is the contented one who gives up (longing for) what is not got and is even towards what is got, not\nseeing (i.e. ignoring) grief and joy, who does not admire what is not got, enjoys according to desire\nwhat is (actually) got and is benign in his conduct.\nLiberation while alive arises when the thought delights in what is got, like a good woman in a harem\nand this gives the joy of the spirit\u2019s own nature.\nIV-39-43. The wise person should reflect about the path to liberation, every moment, in the manner of\nthe Shastras, according to the place, convenience and contact with good people, until he achieves\nrepose in the spirit. A person having repose in the fourth state (liberation) and released from the ocean\nof worldly life, whether he lives or not, be he house-holder or recluse, has no purpose (meaning) in\nwhat is done or not done, nor by the delusion of Veda and Smriti; he remains in his pristine condition\nlike the ocean without being churned by the mountain (he is in a transcendental state).\nWhen there arises the pure realization of all as the spirit, then shines the \u2018body\u2019 in the form of the\nconsciousness, beyond origin, space and time.\nIV-44-49. The visible cosmos of un-moving and moving things melts away like dream in a (dreamless)\nsleep. The wise people have attributed, for empirical purposes, names for the supreme Being, such as,\nRita Atma, Para Brahma, Truth etc. Just as armlets etc., are only words and meanings, not different\nfrom gold, so also is the magical illusion of the cosmos extended by the supreme being.\nThe perceived being inside the visible world is called bondage, in the absence (dissolution) of the\nvisible, he is realized. What is called the visible is the projection like, \u2018The universe is you, and I\u2019. The\nillusion of the world is spread only by the mind \u2013 as long as it happens, this is no liberation.\nIV-50-57. The cosmos is spread (generated) through the mind by the self-born supreme being. So the\nvisible cosmos is mental in nature. There is no real mind; it is only the flash of things. Know the mind\nto be only ideation. Understand that where there is ideation there is Mind. Mind and ideation are never\ndifferent \u2013 when the mass of ideations slips away only the (pristine) nature remains.\nWhen the excitement of the visible, viz., \u2018I and you are the cosmos\u2019 dies down, only the sole condition\n(pristineness) remains. At the achievement of the great dissolution, when all the visible creation etc.,\nbecome (i.e. known to be) non-existent, only tranquillity remains. There exists the unborn, divine unailing, shining being, the unsetting sun, forever, the maker of all, declared to be the supreme self. From\nwhom words turn away (un-reaching), who is realized (only) by the liberated person, whose names like\n(individual) selves are assumed, not natural.\nIV-58-63. O great sage, of the three kinds of ether (space) namely the mental, spiritual and gross, know\nthe spiritual one to be (emptier) subtler than the other two. When the perception passes from one place\nto another, the interval is to be known as the spiritual region in a moment when you reach the stage\nwhere all ideations are rejected, then surely you will reach the state of All Quiet.\nThat condition (state) is Samadhi which excludes bliss and contains the essence of detachment of\nNobility and Beauty \u2013 when joy arises strongly by the realization of the falseness of the visible world\nand like and dislike thin away.\n\nThis realization is indeed the knowledge and its object, spiritual in nature \u2013 only that is the sole state \u2013\nall else is false.\nIV-64-69. Nidagha, know the world to be an illusion, Airavata in rut is confined to a corner of a\nmustard, a mosquito fights with groups of lions inside an atom, Meru put inside a lotus is pat out by a\nbee.\nOnly the mind made impure by involvement etc., is worldly life. The same mind is said to be the end of\n(worldly) existence when freed from them. An embodied being attained that condition being brooded\nover by the mind \u2013 freed from bodily tendencies, it (he) is not smeared (affected) by the body\u2019s\nattributes.\nI am that (the mind) which turns an aeon into a moment and vice versa. One cannot attain (realize)\n(truth) without desisting from bad conduct, without calmness and concentration but only through\nEnlightenment.\nIV-70-72. One fears never (and from nothing) on knowing the nature of the self as Bliss unequalled,\nattributeless and one mass of truth and consciousness. That is beyond all that is beyond, greater than\nthe greatest, lustrous and eternal in nature, wise, ancient Being, worshipped by all gods. As a rule \u2018I\n(am) Brahman\u2019 these two words are for the liberation of the great. Whereas \u2018Not Mine\u2019 and \u2018Mine\u2019 give\nliberation and bondage (respectively).\nIV-73-75. The creation (of the world) is assumed (projected) by God starting from the vision and\nending with Entry (from Generation to Dissolution) in the form of Jiva, Ishvara etc. The nature of the\nanimate and the inanimate worldly life from waking to liberation is projected by Jiva.\nSchools from the Trinachiketa to the Yoga depend on Ishvara\u2019s illusion (on the still lower level); from\nthe Lokayata to Sankhya the schools depend on Jiva\u2019s illusion. Hence, the aspirants to liberation should\nnot consider these schools (being illusory) but the (essential) truth about Brahman is to be considered\nwith steadiness.\nIV-76-82. Only one who looks upon everything in relation to consciousness is the knower proper,\nShiva, Vishnu and Brahma. Without a good preceptor\u2019s grace it is hard to give up objects, to see truth\nand (to realize) the pristine state. The pristine state is naturally realized by a Yogin who has power\ngenerated in him and has given up all (worldly) activity.\nWhen a man perceives even a little difference (between these) then, there will be fear for him,\ndoubtless. A person with wisdom as the eye sees the supreme as present everywhere \u2013 one without\nwisdom does not, like a blind man, the sun.\nThe supreme being is knowledge alone \u2013 so a mortal becomes immortal only by vision of Brahman.\nWhen the Great beyond is seen, the knot of the heart snaps, all doubts are smashed and all (worldly)\nactions die away.\nIv-83-87. Be devoted to Samvid, with single attention, giving up the non-spiritual attitude and\nunaffected by the condition of the world. In a desert all the water (in mirages) is an illusion \u2013 only the\ndesert is real; (similarly) on reflection all the three worlds are nothing more than chit.\nHe who remains giving up what is implied and expressed is Shiva himself, the best of the BrahmanKnowers. That un-decaying being is the substratum (of all), without comparison beyond words and\nmind, eternal, omnipotent, omnipresent and subtle.\nThe mind and the world are (only) the blooming of the supreme being; worldly life is reduced by the\nrestraint (of the mind) and non-restraint (of the spirit).\nIV-88-106. I shall tell you the means of curing mental ills \u2013 giving up whatever object is attractive, one\nattains liberation. Pity that worm of a man who cannot do this giving up which is absolutely good and\ndependent on oneself.\nThe auspicious path cannot be got without subduing the mind which is giving up desires and which can\nbe achieved by one\u2019s own effort. When the mind is cut by the weapon of non-projection, then is\nachieved (realized) the Brahman, omnipresent and tranquil. Hold yourself, un-excited, released from\nthought of worldly existence, having great wisdom \u2013 the swallowed (controlled) mind is the place of\n\nknowledge.\nResorting to great effort, making the mind non-mind, meditating in the heart, with the edge of the\nwheel of consciousness. Kill the mind without hesitation; your (internal) enemies will not bind you.\n\u2018I am he, this is mine\u2019, the mind is only so much \u2013 this is cut down by the knife of non-projection. The\nmind is blown away only by the wind of non-projection, like the bank of clouds in the autumn sky. Let\nthe winds of deluge blow, let the oceans become one (to destroy the world), let all the twelve suns\nblaze; the mind is not affected.\nYou remain intent upon that state of the empire of truth which can only be non-projection and which\ngives all success.\nNowhere is the mind seen to be without fickleness \u2013 it is the nature of mind, just as heat is that of fire.\nThis power of pulsation existing as mind \u2013 know this to be the power which is the ostentatious world.\nThe mind without wavering is said to be Amrita. The same is said to be liberation in the Shastraic\ndoctrine.\nThis wavering which is another name for ignorance \u2013 destroy this with reflection. Sinless one, be free\nfrom projections (vikalpas) attaining that position with which the mind becomes united by means of\nhuman effort.\nHence, resorting to (human) effort, possessing (i.e. Controlling) the mind with the mind, be form and\nfree from anxiety, in the place without grief. Only the mind can control the mind firmly \u2013 who can\ncontrol a king except another king ?\nFor those grasped by the crocodile of desire and fallen into the ocean of worldly life and carried away\n(tossed about) by the whirlpools, only the mind is the life-boat. Break the mind, with the mind, the\nrope, uplift yourself from worldly life \u2013 which cannot be crossed by another.\nIV-117-115. Whatever propensity called the mind arises from previous (other) impulses, these a wise\none is to avoid and from this there will be reduction of ignorance. Give up the tendency to differentiate;\ngiving up the instinct for (worldly) enjoyment \u2013 then giving up both positive and negative (tendencies),\nbe blissful without mental projection.\nThe avoidance of desire towards whatever is seen is the destruction of the mind, of ignorance. Freedom\nfrom desire is extinction (liberation), acceptance of desire is misery.\nIn the un-enlightened people ignorance is seen to exist. How can it exist in a person of sound wisdom,\nbeing accepted only in name. Ignorance swings a person on the steep rocks of samsara, having the\nthorny bushes of misery, not when ignorance dies away leading to the desire for perception of the self,\nreducing delusions. When everything is seen, this desire too melts away.\nThis ignorance is only desire, its destruction is said to be liberation \u2013 this results by the destruction of\nprojections. The intense darkness, ignorance, is reduced when, in the sky of the mind, the night of\npropensities fades away, by the sight of the sun of consciousness.\nIv-116-121. The supreme lord is the ineffable conscious principle present every where and devoid of\nmental misery. All this (cosmos) is Brahman, eternally conscious, undecaying. The other thing namely\nmental projections, does not really exist.\nNothing is really born, dies in this triad of worlds, nor is there any reality in various stages of things;\nonly Pure Consciousness is real, which is aloof, shining by itself common to all and free from mental\ntorment.\nWhen this is ever realized as pure, untroubled, serene, calm and unchanging, this mind realizes through\nreflection \u2013 the mind is called so because of reflection.\nIV-122-125. So, this thought caused by force, is destroyed by resolution. The mind is bound strongly\nby the resolution \u2018I am not Brahman\u2019; it is released by the resolve \u2018I am Brahman\u2019; it is bound by the\nconcept in keeping with the thought \u2018I am, lean, bound by misery; I have hands, feet etc.\u2019 Whereas, it is\nreleased by the conviction following the thought \u2018I am not miserable, I have no body, the soul is not\nbound\u2019. One is liberated when ignorance dies away, by the internal conviction. \u2018I am not the flesh, the\nbones; I am beyond the body\u2019.\n\nIV-126-131. \u2018This ignorance is due to imagination, by conceiving the non-spirit as spirit. Resorting to\ngreat effort, with supreme resolve, and abandoning desire at a distance, be blissful without fancy.\nMy son, my wealth, he is mine \u2013 such propensity leaps about by the tangle of senses. Do not be\nignorant, be wise; give up involvement is samsara \u2013 why do you wail like an ignorant person by such\nattachment ? What is this body of yours, dull, dumb, impure lump of flesh, for which you are\noverpowered by worldly pleasure and pain ?\nIt is strange that the true Brahman is forgotten by people ! May you not be smeared by attachment\nwhen you are active.\nStrange also that mountains are bound by lotus fibre ! This universe is perturbed by the ignorance\nwhich is non-existent ! Mere grass has become adamant !\nV-1-7. Then I shall speak truly of the seven steps of ignorance, seven of wisdom. The stages between\nare countless and produced otherwise.\nLiberation is existence in natural (spiritual) condition; lapse from it is the concept of \u2018I\u2019 \u2013 attributes like\ndesire and hate, born of ignorance, are not for those who do not swerve from their nature as a result of\nthe realization of pure consciousness.\nThe fall from spiritual nature, the drowning of consciousness in mental matters; there is no other\ndelusion, now or in future, than this.\nThe existence in spiritual nature is said to be the destruction of mental activity, being in the middle\n(unaffected), when the mind goes from object to object. The existence-supreme in nature is remaining\nlike stone, all ideation dying out, free from waking and sleep.\nThat is one\u2019s own (spiritual) nature which is not inert, the non-pulsating (placid) mind, when the egoaspect is dead.\nV-8-20. Waking in seed state, (simple) waking, great waking, etc., the seven-fold delusion -when these\ncombine among themselves, they become manifold; hear of its nature.\nThe first stage is the consciousness undesirable, pure condition, taking the name of mind, Jiva etc.,\nwhich will come into existence. Waking existing as seed (potential) is said to be waking-in-seed \u2013 this\nis the new or first condition of consciousness.\nThe waking state (second): after the new stage, the (subtle) concept \u2018I\u2019, \u2018Mine\u2019 arising purely \u2013 this is\nwaking, non-existent earlier.\nThe great waking: the broad (gross) concept arising in a previous birth as \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018Mine\u2019.\nThe Waking-Dream: The \u2018kingdom\u2019 of the mind, which has developed or not, as identifying one\u2019s self\nwith these.\nThe dream state: it is of many kinds arising from the waking state, in the form of two-moons, shellsilver, mirage etc. The reflection by the awakened person \u2018this was seen only a short time, it will not\narise \u2013 Because of not seeing for long, it is like the working state.\u2019\nThe dream-waking state: the inert condition of Jiva, giving up the six conditions.\nThe deep sleep is filled with the future misery \u2013 in which condition the world is merged in darkness.\nThe seven stages have been spoken by me of ignorance \u2013 each of these has hundreds of varieties with\nvarious splendours.\nV-21-35. By knowing the seven stages of knowledge, one will not be sub-merged in the mire of\nillusions. Many schools speak variously of the stages of Yoga but only the following are acceptable to\nme: liberation follows after the seven stages.\nThe first stage of knowledge \u2013 is auspicious desire, the second is reflection, the third is thinning of the\nmind, the fourth is attainment of Sattva, then detachment, the sixth is reflection on objects and the\nseventh is of the Turiya.\nTheir explanation: The wise say that the auspicious desire is the desire following detachment \u2013\nmeditation \u2018why do I remain like a fool, being looked upon by good people ?\u2019\nReflection is good activity (tendency) after the practice of detachment and contact with scriptures and\n\ngood people.\nThinning of the Mind is the condition where the attachment to sense-objects is reduced by means of\nauspicious desire and reflection.\nSattvapatti is the mind in the pure Sattva condition by the practice of the above three stages.\nThe Asamsakti stage is the developed condition, without even a trace of involvement, by means of the\npractice of the four stages.\nPadarthabhavana is the sixth stage resulting from the five stages, delighting in the spirit firmly by the\nnon-contemplation of objects internal and external.\nThe \u2018Fourth\u2019 (Transcendental) condition (here the seventh) is concentration on one\u2019s nature, seeing no\nreal difference, by the long practice of the six stages \u2013 this is the stage of Jivanmukti.\nThe stage \u2018Beyond the Fourth\u2019 is the stage of liberation without the body.\nV-36-40. Nidagha, those who have reached the seventh stage, delight in the spirit \u2013 they do not drown\nin pleasure and pain. They do (or not do) whatever is only relevant and minimal. They perform actions\nfollowing the past, awakened (impelled) by those nearby, like one waking from sleep.\nThese seven stages can be known only by the enlightened \u2013 reaching which condition, even animals,\nbarbarians etc., are liberated with or without the body surely.\nWisdom indeed is the breaking of the knot and the liberation \u2013 the dying of the illusion of mirage.\nV-41. But those who have crossed the ocean of illusion \u2013 they have reached the high position.\nV-42-43. The means of calming the mind is said to be Yoga. This is to be known as having seven stages\nwhich lead to the status of Brahman.\nV-44. There, there is no feeling of \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019, one\u2019s own and another, nor the perception of existence\nor non-existence.\nV-45. All is calm (needing) no support, existing in the ether (of the heart), eternal, auspicious, devoid of\nailment and illusion, name and cause.\nV-46. Neither existent nor-existent, nor in between, nor the negation of all; beyond the grasp of mind\nand words, fuller than the fullest, more joyful than joy.\nV-47. Beyond (worldly) perception, the limit of one\u2019s hope (horizon) extensive, there is no existence of\nany thing other than pure cognition.\nV-48. The body exists only when there is the relationship of the perceiver, the perceived and the vision\nconnecting them, whereas this position (of liberation) is devoid of such relation (of the distinct)\nPerceiver, Perception and object.\nV-49. \u2018In between the movement of the mind from object to object there is the unqualified essence of\nintelligence. This is immaterial perception, reflection; always identify yourself with That.\nV-50. \u2018Your eternal essence (is), devoid of states like wakefulness, dream and deep sleep or Equalities\nlike intelligence and inertness; always identify yourself with that.\nV-51. \u2018Excluding that heart of stone, inertness, always identify yourself with that which is beyond the\nmind. Discarding the mind in the far distance (you see) you are that which is; be established as That.\nV-52. \u2018First the mind was formed from the principle of the supreme Self; by the mind has this world,\nwith its multitudinous details, been spread out. Wise men ! The nihil, alluringly named, shines forth\nfrom the nihil as the blue does from the sky.\nV-53. \u2018When the mind is dissolved, through the attenuation of mental constructions, the mist of cosmic\nfancies will stand dissolved. The one, infinite, unborn, pristine and pure Spirit shines forth within as the\ncloudless sky in autumn.\nV-54. \u2018In the sky has sprung up a picture without a painter or a basis (i.e. canvas). It has no perceiver;\n(it is) one\u2019s own experience without the medium of sleep or dream.\nV-55. \u2018In the conscious Self that is the witness, common, transparent and indisputable, as a mirror, are\nreflected all the worlds without willing (of any kind).\nV-56. \u2018For curing the mind of its fickleness, deliberately reflect that the one Brahman is the Sky of the\nSpirit, the impartite Self of the cosmos.\n\nV-57. \u2018As an immense rock, covered with main lines and sub-lines, learn to regard the one Brahman\nwith the three worlds superposed on It.\nV-58. \u2018Now it has been known that this problem world is not produced, as there is no second entity to\nserve as a cause. This alluring (world) may be looked upon as a marvel.\nV-59. \u2018Long agitated (as I have been, now) I am at rest; there is nothing other than pure Spirit. Laying\naside all doubts, discarding all sense of wonder, behold !\nV-60(a). \u2018Repudiating all mental constructions, the principle of mindlessness (may be seen to be) the\nhighest status.\nV-60(b). \u2018(The sages), having liquidated their sins, have attained infinitude -V-61(a). \u2018Those (sages) whose intellects are great and tranquil and who have risen above the mind.\nV-61(b)-62. \u2018One who has reasoned out (the nature of things according to the Vedanta), the\nmodifications of whose mind (objectively induced) have ceased, who has given up all reasoning (vis-\u00e0vis objects), who has dismissed the objective realm, empty of values but has seized on what alone has\neternal value, has a mind that conforms to the eternal Reality.\nV-63-66. \u2018When the net of deep-seated impressions of empirical life is split as a fowler\u2019s net by a rat,\nwhen, due to dispassion\u2019s power, the knots of the heart are loosened, one\u2019s nature as Brahman becomes\ncrystal clear owing to the experiential Knowledge (of Brahman) even as muddy water treated with the\nKataka-powder. Now one experiences the eternal Witness; no longer one beholds the inert (non-Seen).\nWhile (yet) living one is awakened to the supreme Truth that alone is to be realized. One is totally\noblivious of the ways of the world, shrouded in the thick gloom of delusion; and due to an eminent\ndegree of mature dispassion, one ceases to have any relish for even the so-called delectables that are (in\nfact) dry and tasteless.\nV-67. \u2018Like a bird from its cage, from delusions flies forth the mind devoid of attachments, frailties,\ndualities and props.\nV-68. \u2018The mind filled with (Truth) shines like the full-moon vanquishing all meanness born of\nperplexities and dismissing all dilemmas due to (idle) curiosities.\nV-69. \u2018Neither I nor aught else exists here; I am but Brahman that is Peace\u2019 \u2013 thus perceives he who\nbeholds the link between the existent and the non-existent.\nV-70. \u2018As the mind indifferently contacts objects of the senses of sight, etc.; when encountered by\nchance, so does the man of steadfast intellect regard (courses of) action (in his daily life).\nV-71. \u2018Experience lived through Knowledgeably alone proves satisfactory. The thief recognised and\nbefriended is no longer a thief but turns out to be a friend.\nV-72. \u2018As an unplanned journey to a village, when accomplished, is treated (without) elation) by the\ntravellers, so is the splendour of enjoyment (that may fall to their lot) deemed by those who know.\nV-73. \u2018Even a little diversion of the well-controlled mind is reckoned quite ample; no elaboration of it\nis sought as such (elaboration) is a source of (future) afflictions.\nV-74. A King liberated from detention is glad to eat (but) a morsel. One unattacked and undetained\nhardly cares for his (entire) kingdom.\nV-75. \u2018Locking one arm in the other, setting one row of teeth on the other and putting some limbs\nagainst others, conquer the mind.\nV-76. \u2018From this sea of empirical life there is no way out except victory over the mind. In this vast\nempire of hell, hard to subdue are one\u2019s and adversaries \u2013 the sense-organs \u2013 who ride on the unruly\nelephants, the sins, and are armed with the long arrows of cravings.\nV-77. \u2018In the case of one whose egoistic vigour has been attenuated and who has vanquished his foes,\nthe sense-organs, latent impressions, intent on enjoyments, wear off as lotuses do in winter.\nV-78. \u2018Like no eternal spirits; latent impressions cut capers only as long as the mind remains\nunvanquished for lack of intense cultivation of the non-dual truth.\nV-79. \u2018Of the men of discrimination, the mind, I deem, is a servant as it accomplishes what is sought; a\nminister as it proves the cause of all gains; and a loyal chieftain as it regulates the assailing sense-\n\norgans.\nV-80. \u2018The mind of the wise, I deem, is a loving spouse as it pleases; a protective parent as it guards\nand a friend as it marshals the best (arguments)\nV-81. \u2018The paternal mind, well studied with the eye of the Shastras and realized in (the light of) one\u2019s\nown reason; abolishes itself in yielding supreme perfection.\nV-82. \u2018Extremely perverse and inveterate (in itself), (once) well-awakened and controlled and purged,\nthe delightful mind-gem shines (in one\u2019s heart) powered by its own virtues.\nV-83. \u2018O Brahmin ! To win perfection be luminous after washing clean, in the waters of discrimination,\nthe mind-gem steeped in the mire of many flaws.\nV-84. \u2018By wholly overcoming the inimical senses, resorting to sovereign discrimination, and beholding\nthe Truth with the intellect, cross the sea of empirical existence.\nV-85. \u2018The wise know that concern, as such, is the abode of endless pains; they also know that unconcern is the home of joys, both here and hereafter.\nV-86. \u2018Bound by the cords of latent impressions this world revolves (constituting empirical life). In\nmanifestation, they agonise; when obliterated they make for well-being.\nV-87. \u2018Though intellectual, though extremely and variously learned, though high-born and eminent,\none is bound by cravings as a lion is with a chain.\nV-88. \u2018resorting to supreme personal endeavour and perseverance and conforming to Shastraic conduct\nunwaveringly, who may not win perfection ?\nV-89. \u2018I am this entire cosmos; I am the supreme Self that lapses not. Nothing other than me is \u2013 this\nvision is the supreme assertion of the Self as \u2018I\u2019 (or, the first level of self-assertion).\nV-90. \u2018I transcend all; I am subtler than a hair\u2019s tip\u2019 \u2013 such, O Brahmin, is the second and beneficent\nmode of self -assertion.\nV-91. \u2018This (mode) promotes liberation and not bondage. (Witness) the case of the Liberated in-life.\nV-92. \u2018The conviction that I am no more than a bundle of parts like hands, feet, etc.; is the third mode\nof self-assertion \u2013 it is empirical and petty.\nV-93. \u2018This root of the evil tree of empirical life is wicked and must be renounced. Smitten by this, the\nworldly man rapidly falls ever lower.\nV-94. \u2018Discarding this wicked mode of self-assertion from one\u2019s life, in due course, by virtue of the\nbeneficent mode, one achieves liberation in peace.\nV-95. \u2018Resorting to the first two non-worldly modes of self-assertion, the third worldly mode that\noccasions pain must be renounced.\nV-96. \u2018Next discarding even the first two, one becomes free from all modes of self-assertion and thus\nascends to the transcendent status (of freedom).\nV-97. \u2018Bondage is nothing but craving for objective enjoyment; its renunciation is said to be liberation.\nMind\u2019s affirmation is perilous; its negation is great good fortune. The mind of the Knower tends to\nnegation; the mind of the ignorant is the chain (of bondage).\nV-98. \u2018The (timeless) mind of the Knower is either blissful nor blissless; neither fickle nor stirless. It\nneither is nor is not. Nor does it occupy a mind position among all these \u2013 so maintain the wise.\nV-99. \u2018Just as, due to subtlety ether, illumined by the Spirit, is not (objectively) perceived, so the\nimpartite Spirit, though all perceiving, is not observed.\nV-100. \u2018The imperishable Spirit, free from all imaginings and beyond nomenclature, has been assigned\ndesignations like one\u2019s Self, etc.\nV-101-102. \u2018Transparent like a hundredth part of ether, partless as manifested in those who know, ever\naware of the sole Self of all that is pure in empirical life, this Spirit neither sets nor rises; neither rises\nup nor lies (low); neither goes nor returns; it is neither present nor absent here.\nV-103. \u2018This Spirit has a flawless mode (of its own), indubitable and propless.\nV-104. \u2018At the very outset, purify the disciple through excellence such as mind\u2019s tranquillity, restraint\nof sense-organs, etc. Next impart to him the teaching that all this (world) is Brahman, viz., the purified\n\nThou.\nV-105. \u2018One who teaches an ignoramus or half-awakened (disciple) that \u2018all this is Brahman\u2019 will (in\neffect) plunge him in an endless series of hells.\nV-106. \u2018But a disciple whose intellect has been well-awakened, whose craving for objective\nenjoyments has been extinguished, and who is free from all \u2018expectations\u2019 is rid of all impurities born\nof nescience; the wise teacher may instruct him.\nV-107. \u2018Like its effulgence where there is light, like the day where there is the sun, like the fragrance\nwhere there is a flower, so is there a world where there is the Spirit.\nV-108. \u2018When the view-point of Knowledge is purged, when (the dawn of) awakening spreads vastly,\nthis very world will cease to appear as real.\nV-109. \u2018Established in yourself, you will realize aright the strength and weakness of the flood of my\nwords (of instruction) \u2013 (you will realize it) by the highest mode of nescience that spurs the effort to\nwipe out the sphere of the petty Self.\nV-100. \u2018By it (the highest mode of nescience) is won the knowledge that consumes all errors, O\nBrahmin ! One missile puts another out of action; one flaw destroys its opposite.\nV-111. \u2018One poison may be neutralised by another; an enemy may destroy another. Such is the\nwonderful riddle of elements that pleases through self-destruction !\nV-112. \u2018The real nature of this riddle is not perceived. As it is observed, it perishes \u2013 observed with the\nflaming imagination whose content is: \u2018in Truth it exists not at all\u2019.\nV-113. \u2018He who cherishes with the (creative) and liberating imagination (the thought that) all this is\nspirit, that the perception of difference is nescience, should renounce this (nescience) in all possible\nways.\nV-114. \u2018sage ! That ultimate Status which is said to be imperishable is (in truth) not won. Twice-born\nsage ! Speculate not as to whence this (nescience) has arisen.\nV-115. \u2018Speculate rather on: \u2018how shall I destroy it ? Once it is dissipated and dispelled you will\n(renunciation-)cognise that status.\nV-116. \u2018That integral status (includes the knowledge) \u2018Whence this Maya has come and how it has\nperished. Therefore try to treat (with remedies) this abode of diseases (i.e. Maya).\nV-117-118(a). \u2018So that she may not subject you again to the sufferings of birth (etc.,). \u2018The sea of the\nSpirit shines forth in one\u2019s Self with its splendid inner vibrations. With certitude meditate inwardly that\nis homogeneous and infinite.\nV-118(b). \u2018The power of the Spirit in the sea of the Spirit is a slightly agitated state of the latter.\nV-119. Like a wave in the sea, that pure Power shines forth there, just as the wind automatically blows\nin the sky.\nV-120. \u2018In the same way, the Self in itself, by its own power, becomes mobile. That omnipotent Deity\nflashes forth for a moment.\nV-121. \u2018Whose potencies of space, time and action are not enhanced (by any means); who is preeminently established in her infinitude, being fully conscious of her own essential nature.\nV-122. Un-comprehended, She brings into being a finite form. When that supremely enchanting Deity\nbrings forth that (finite) form.\nV-123-124(a). Other ideas (views), names, number, etc.; follow her. The individual self (\u2018Knower of\nthe field\u2019) is the designation of this form of the Spirit, O Brahmin; it is the basis of space, time and\nactivity, and its forms are rooted in manifold (mental) constructions.\nV-124(b). \u2018He (\u2018the Knower of the field\u2019) generating latent impressions, again, assumes the form of\negoism.\nV-125. \u2018The tainted egoism, as determiner, is called intellect, which, imagining forms, becomes the\nbase for cogitation (or mind).\nV-126. \u2018With its profuse imaginings the mind slowly is (transmuted into) sense-organs. The wise deem\nthe body with its hands and feet (nothing but) the senses.\n\nV-127. \u2018Thus, indeed, in stages descends the Jiva, bound by the cords of imaginings and impressions,\nand encompassed by a multitude of sufferings.\nV-128. \u2018The potent Spirit, thus degenerating into dense egoism, passes voluntarily into bondage as a\nsilk-worm in its cocoon.\nV-129. \u2018And, like a lion in chains, becomes totally dependent finding itself within a net of its own\nimaginings and nothing more.\nV-130. \u2018Sometimes (it operates as) mind, sometimes as intellect; sometimes as cognition; sometimes as\n(pure) action. Sometimes it is egoism and sometimes it is held to be what is thought.\nV-131. \u2018Sometimes it is called Prakriti and sometimes it is held to be Maya. Sometimes it is designated\na \u2018flaw\u2019 and sometimes referred to as \u2018action\u2019.\nV-132. \u2018Sometimes it is proclaimed as bondage and sometimes accounted the \u2018eight-fold case\u2019.\nSometimes it is said to be avidya and sometimes it is identified with \u2018desire\u2019.\nV-133. \u2018Bearing within itself, as its seeds the fig-tree, this entire empirical sphere that fashions the\ncords of cravings, the Jiva is verily a tree sans fruits.\nV-134-135(a). O Brahmin ! Like an elephant stuck in the morass, is the mind consumed in the flames\nof worries, crushed by the python of rage, attached to the waves of the sea of lust, and oblivious of its\nown grand progenitor (the Spirit): -- rescue it.\nV-135(b)-136. \u2018Thus are the Jivas (living beings) phases of the Spirit and established through bringing\nthe empirical sphere into being. Their forms, in lakhs and Crores, have been assigned by Brahma.\nNumberless (Jivas) were born in the past and even now are being brought forth on all sides.\nV-137. \u2018Others also will be born like multitudes of water-drops from a water-fall. Some of them are in\ntheir first birth; others have (already) had more than a hundred births.\nV-138. \u2018Yet others have (already) had countless births. Some will have two or more births, besides.\nSome are born as sub-human and super-human beings, gifted with music and Knowledge; some as\nmighty reptiles.\nV-139. \u2018Some of (these living beings) are (to be identified with) the sun, the moon and the lord of\nwaters; others with Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma. Some divided themselves as Brahmins, Kshatriyas,\nVaishyas, Sudras.\nV-140. \u2018Others with grass, herbs, trees, with their fruits, roots and winged insects. Jivas are (also to be\nidentified with) trees like the Kadamba, the Jambira, the Sama, Tala and Tamala.\nV-141. \u2018And with mounts like Mahendra, Malaya, Sahya, Mandara and Meru; and with the seas of salt\nwater, milk, ghee and sugarcane-juice.\nV-142. \u2018And with the vast quarters, and fast-running rivers; some of these sport high above (the earth);\nsome descend and again fly upwards.\nV-143-144(a). \u2018Hit ceaselessly by death, as though they are balls hit by the hands, these Jivas are\nceaselessly struck down by death as balls are by the hand. Having undergone thousands of births,\nagain, some unwise ones despite (a degree of) discrimination, fall into the turmoils of worldly life.\nV-144(b)-145. \u2018The principle of the Self, undetermined by space, time, etc.; by virtue of Its power, just\nsportively assumes a body spatial and temporal. Possessed of innate tendencies (to manifest) various\norders of living beings, Itself is the supreme (Lord and Creator) that becomes the mind, that is unstable\nand inclined to construction and dissolution.\nV-146-148(a). \u2018In the beginning in a moment, the Constructive Power of the Mind fashions the\ntransparent (image of) space inclined to own, as its essence, the seed of sound. Then, becoming dense,\nby the process of gross vibrations, that mind brings forth the vibrations of air inclined to own the seed\nof touch.\nV-148(b)-149(a). \u2018Of these two space and air, the bases of sound and touch, by intense repetitive\nfrictions, is generated the fire.\nV-149(b)-150. \u2018Then the mind enriched by these three including rudimentary form proceeds to the\nnotion of pure liquidity and, instantaneously, becomes aware of the coolness of water followed by the\n\nperception of water.\nV-151. \u2018The mind thus enriched by such attributes meditates all at once on rudimentary smell; thence\narises the perception of the earth-element.\nV-152. \u2018Next this body encompassed by the rudimentary elements discards its subtleness beholding in\nthe sky a flash like a spark of fire.\nV-153. \u2018Conjoined to the element of egoism and the seed of the intellect, this bee in the lotus of the\nelemental heart is (now) styled the Puryashtaka.\nV-154. \u2018Due to intensity of yearning in it, by meditating on a resplendent embodiment, the mind grows\ngrosser as a Bilva-fruit does through the process of ripening.\nV-155. \u2018That effulgence in the sky, shining like liquid gold in a crucible, assumes a form with definite\ncontours by virtue of its inherent nature.\nV-156. \u2018Upwards is the round head; downwards the feet. Of the two sides are the hands and in the\nmiddle what functions as the belly.\nV-157(a). \u2018In course of time the body (indwelt by the mind) gets fully developed and becomes flawless.\nV-157(b)-158(a). \u2018That same divine Brahma, the grandfather of the entire world, gets established in\nintelligence, purity, strength, energy, forms of knowledge and lordship.\nV-158(b)-160(a). \u2018Beholding his own attractive and pre-eminent body, the blessed Lord, the range of\nwhose perception embraces all the three divisions of time, wondered what first would make its\nappearance in this supreme space whose essence is pure Spirit and whose limits are nowhere.\nV-160(b). \u2018Thus wondered Brahma whose vision was as flawless as that of Shiva.\nV-161. \u2018In large groups he behold bygone orders of (cosmic) manifestation. Next he recollected them\nall in the due order of all their attributes.\nV-162. \u2018(Then) sportively he fashioned, by (sheer) imagination, variegated living beings with their\nunique patterns of behaviour \u2013 the whole constituting, as it were, a city in the sky.\nV-163. \u2018For securing their happy state as well as liberation, for attaining righteousness, love and\nwealth, he set up Shastras endless and varied.\nV-164. \u2018As the existence of the world has been set up by mind in the form of Brahma, it lasts only as\nlong as Brahma; with his destruction, the world too perishes.\nV-165. \u2018O best of Brahmins, in reality nothing anywhere, at any time, is born or is destroyed. All that is\nseen is unreal (neither is nor is not).\nV-166. \u2018Give up the idle show of empirical life, a very pit of the serpents of cravings. Knowing this to\nbe unreal, reduce them all to the status of their ground.\nV-167. Vis-\u00e0-vis \u2018the city in the sky\u2019, whether adorned or not, or the parts of its constitutive case (the\nnescience), progeny etc., what rationale is there for pleasures and pains ?\nV-168. \u2018Sorrow \u2013 and not a sense of gratification \u2013 is in order as regards wealth and spouse in their\nnourishing state. Who can have a sense of reassurance here as the nescience of delusion gets more and\nmore entrenched ?\nV-169. \u2018Those very (empirical) experiences which, in their abundance, cause a fool to get attached (to\nthis world) are the source, in the case of a wise man, of his dispassion.\nV-170. \u2018Therefore, Nidagha, with your awareness of Truth, cultivate indifference to whatever has\nperished among the activities of empirical life and accept whatever offers itself.\nV-171. \u2018The marks of a man of discrimination are spontaneous indifference to experiences that do not\ncome of their own accord and hearty acceptance of those that do.\nV-172. \u2018Knowing and resorting to the untarnished middle status between the real and the unreal, neither\ncling to nor fly from the objective realm, external or internal.\nV-173. \u2018The intelligence of a wise and active man, free from attachment and aversion, remains\nuntarnished like a lotus leaf unmoistened by water.\nV-174. \u2018O twice-born (sage), if the glamour of objects charms not your heart, then, having grasped\nwhat ought to be known (achieved true wisdom), you have crossed the sea of empirical life.\n\nV-175. \u2018In order to win the pre-eminent Status separate, by means of supreme wisdom, the functioning\nmind from (all) latent impressions as one does a strong scent from the flower.\nV-176. \u2018The superior men of discrimination who board the Ship of Wisdom cross this sea of empirical\nlife full of the waters of latent impressions.\nV-177. \u2018Those men who know this world as well as what is beyond conform to all things. They neither\nshun nor seek the ways of the world.\nV-178. \u2018The sprouting of mental construction consists in Spirits\u2019 proneness to objects (\u2018knowables\u2019) \u2013\nthe Spirit that is infinite, that is the Truth of the Self, and that is Universal Being.\nV-179. \u2018That very sprouting having lightly come into being gradually fills out, developing into the\nmind; then it promotes inertness like a cloud.\nV-180. \u2018Imagining objects as other than the Self, as it were, the Spirit is transformed into a constructive\nprocess, as it were; just as a seed is into a sprout.\nV-181. (Mental) construction is indeed the process of putting together (of constituents); it comes\nautomatically into being and waxes fast unto pain, never unto delight.\nV-182. \u2018Indulge not in mental construction; in a state of stability, dwell not on positive existence.\nPersevere in stopping mental construction. Thus one never again pursues the trail of construction.\nV-183. \u2018By the mere absence of imagination, (the process of) mental construction dwindles\nautomatically. (One act of) construction leads to another. Mind battens on itself, O sage !\nV-184. \u2018Getting (off construction) abide in the Self. Once this is done, what can prove difficult ? Just as\nthis sky is empty, so is the entire cosmos.\nV-185. \u2018Wise Brahmin ! Just as a paddy husk or the black coating on copper, through effort, is\ndestroyed so also may the mental impurities of man.\nV-186. \u2018As a grain of paddy, the innate impurity of a Jiva, too, can be destroyed in ample measure.\nThere is no doubt in that. Therefore, strive\u2019.\nVI-1. \u2018Giving up the deeply felt and seductive glamour, consisting in imagination, of empirical life, you\nremain what you (really) are; O sinless one ! Sportively roam the world.\nVI-2. \u2018By means of the trenchant and creative thought, \"I am a non-agent in all contexts\", there remains\nbut the (perception of) sameness, called, \"supreme immortality\".\nVI-3. \u2018In regard to all elaborations of pain due solely to one\u2019s sense of agency, (finally) there remains\nbut sameness when one\u2019s mental constructions dwindle away.\nVI-4. \u2018This sameness, amidst all emotional moods, is the status grounded in Truth. Anchored in it the\nmind is no more reborn.\nVI-5. \u2018O, sage ! Renouncing all forms of agency and non-agency and abolishing the mind, you remain\nwhat you (really) are; be steadfast.\nVI-6-7. \u2018Stead-fast in the final stability, give up the very tendency to renunciation. Giving up\neverything together with its cause \u2013 the dichotomy between Spirit and mind, light and darkness, etc.;\nthe latent impressions and what generates them \u2013 as well as the vibrations of vital breath, (be you) skylike with a stilled intellect.\nVI-8. \u2018Having totally wiped out from the heart the massed rows of latent impression, one who remains\nfree from all anxiety is the liberated, is the supreme Deity.\nVI-9. \u2018I have seen all that is worth seeing; through delusion have I wandered in all the ten directions of\nspace. For the ignorant who roams, through reasoning, (the regions of) empirical existence, the latter\nshrinks into the dimensions of a cow\u2019s hoof.\nVI-10. \u2018In the body with its ins and outs, up and down, in the regions between, here and there, there is\nthe Self; there is no world that is not the Self through and through.\nVI-11. \u2018There is nothing in which I am not; there is nothing which is not That, through and through.\nWhat more do I want ? All things are essentially Being and Spirit, pervaded by That.\nVI-12. \u2018All this is indeed Brahman; all this extended reality is the Self. I am one and this is another \u2013\n\ngive up this delusion, O sinless one !\nVI-13. \u2018The superimposed (objects) cannot possibly be in the eternal, extended and undivided\nBrahman. There is neither sorrow, delusion, old age nor birth.\nVI-14. \u2018What (in reality) is here only That exists. Always be calm, experiencing things as they occur\nand entertaining no desire whatsoever.\nVI-15(a). Neither shunning nor grasping, be always calm.\nVI-15(b)-16. \u2018Magnanimous one ! Flawless cognitions swiftly fly to him who finds himself in his last\nbirth, just as pure pearls lodge themselves in the best bamboo. This example has been offered to suit\nbest those who develop dispassion.\nVI-17. \u2018The certitude of the joy of cognition (results from) intimate contact of the perceiver and the\nobject. We duly meditate on that stable Self, manifest in the truth of one\u2019s self (the source of the joy of\ncognition).\nVI-18. \u2018Giving up the seer\u2019s perception and the object together with latent impressions, we duly\nmeditate on the Self that manifests Itself first as perception.\nVI-19. \u2018We duly meditate on the eternal Self, the illumination of all lights, that occupies the middle\nground between the \"is\" and the \"is not\".\nVI-20. \u2018Discarding the Lord who reigns in the heart, those who run after (some other) God are in fact\nseeking a gem after casting away the Kaustubha already in their possession.\nVI-21. \u2018As Indra smites mountain peaks with his thunder-bolt, so should one strike, with the rod of\ndiscrimination, these adversaries in the form of sense-organs, both active and passive.\nVI-22. \u2018In the evil dream (seen) in the night of empirical life \u2013 in this empty illusion of the body \u2013\neverything experienced (as the extended) delusion of empirical) life is impure.\nVI-23. \u2018In childhood one is stupefied by ignorance; in youth one in vanquished by woman. In the\nperiod that remains one is worried by one\u2019s wife. What can one \u2013 the meanest of men \u2013 accomplish ?\nVI-24. \u2018(But wail as follows): Unreality rides on the top of existence; ugliness on the top of things\nlovely; pains ride on the top of pleasures. What single entity may I resort to ?\nVI-25. \u2018Even those men pass away on the closing and opening of whose eyes depends world\u2019s disaster\nor prosperity. Of what account are folk like my (humble) self ?\nVI-26. \u2018Empirical life is said to be the very limit of sufferings. When (one\u2019s) body has slipped into its\ndepths, how can pleasure be won ?\nVI-27. \u2018I am awake ! I am awake ! ! Here is the wicked thief (who has been pestering me, viz.,) the\nmind. I shall destroy him; I have long been under his assault.\nVI-28. \u2018Don\u2019t be depressed. Seek not to seize what is fit only to be eschewed. Giving up (ideas of both)\nrejection and seizure, remain rooted in what is neither to be rejected nor seized; be wholly firm.\nVI-29-30. \u2018The Knower rid of things to be rejected or seized has, without latent impressions, qualities\n(such as): freedom from desire and fear, conation and action; eternity, equality, wisdom, gentleness,\ncertitude, steadfastness, amiability, contentment, charity and soft-spokenness.\nVI-31-32. \u2018With the sharp needle of (penetrating) intelligence, tear up the nest cast by the fisherwoman of Craving in the waters of transmigratory life \u2013 a net made of the cords of (variegated)\nthoughts, even as a strong wind scatters (the vast) net of clouds. Then abide in the vast status (as\nimmutable Brahman).\nVI-33. \u2018Cleaving the mind with the mind itself as one does a tree with an axe, and attaining the holy\nstatus, at once, be steadfast.\nVI-34. \u2018Standing or moving, sleeping or walking, dwelling in a place, flying aloft or falling down,\ninwardly sure that (all) this is but unreal, eschew (all) clinging.\nVI-35. \u2018If you depend on this objective (world), you have a mind and are in bondage. If you reject the\nobjective (world), you have no mind; you are liberated.\nVI-36. \u2018\"Neither am I nor is this real\" \u2013 so thinking remain absolutely immovable, in the intervals of\nsubjective and objective awareness.\n\nVI-37. Rid of what enjoys and what is enjoyed, set in the middle ground between the object and its\nenjoyer, be ever given to the contemplation of your Self as (pure) awareness.\nVI-38. \u2018Dwelling on \"the taste\", be filled with the supreme Self; resorting to the propless, steady\nyourself off and on.\nVI-39. \u2018Those who are bound by ropes are released: (but) none in the grip of craving may be released\nby anyone. Therefore, Nidagha, shed craving by renouncing all mental constructions.\nVI-40. \u2018Cutting through this innate and sinful craving whose essence is egoism with the needle of selfabnegation, be stationed in the border land of the future and the present, entirely quelling all fear\nwhatsoever.\nVI-41-43. \u2018Rejecting the inveterate idea. \"I am (the very) life of these objects and these objects are my\n(very) life !\" \"without these I am nothing and they are nothing without me\" and reflecting, \"I do not\nbelong to (any) object and no object belongs to me\", the intellect becomes tranquillised and the actions\nare performed in a sporting spirit. Latent impression (of such an agent) stand renounced. This\nrenunciation, O Brahmin, is extolled as worthy of profound meditation !\nVI-44. \u2018Due to the equilibrium of the intellect, total obliteration of latent impressions is acquired. That\n(indeed) should be deemed the obliteration of latent impressions, having won which one gives up\n(even) the body as one is free from all sense of possessions.\nVI-45. \u2018He is called the Jivanmukta (Liberated-in-life) who lives after giving up all conceivable\nobjects; for he has recreatively given up all latent egoistic impressions.\nVI-46. \u2018Having given up all baseless (mental) constructions and the latent impressions, he who has won\ntranquillity is the best among the Knowers of Brahman; he is the liberated. His renunciation may only\nbe deduced.\nVI-47-48. \u2018These two fearless ones, unconcerned about pleasures and pains that occur in the due course\nof time, have achieved the status as Brahman \u2013 the (passive) renouncer and (the active) Yogin, both of\nwhom are self-disciplined and tranquillised. O Lord of sages ! For they neither strive for nor reject\nanything amidst the inner, mental modifications.\nVI-49-50(a). \u2018He is called the Jivanmukta who lives as one in dreamless sleep, who is neither lifted up\nnor depressed by the emotions of joy, intolerance, fear, anger, lust and helplessness and who is free\nfrom all objective pre-occupations.\nVI-50(b). \u2018the craving born of latent impressions, oriented towards external objects, is said to be bound.\nVI-51-52(a). \u2018The same freed from latent impressions bound up with objects, as such, is said to be\nliberated. Know that the desire culminating in the prayerful thought, \"let this be mind\", to be a strong\nchain that spawns suffering, birth and fear.\nVI-52(b)-53(a). \u2018The magnanimous man renounces (this enchaining desire) vis-\u00e0-vis objects both real\nand unreal and wins the status that is sublime.\nVI-53(b)-54(a). \u2018Then outgrowing the attachment both to bondage and liberation and the states of pain\nand pleasure \u2013 attachment both to the real and unreal \u2013 remains unshaken like the unagitated ocean.\nVI-54(b). \u2018Good Sir, man may have a four-fold certitude.\nVI-55. \u2018Engendered by (my) mother and father, I am (the body) from the foot to the head. This\nparticular certitude, O Brahmin, results from the observation of the worries of bondage !\nVI-56. \u2018Good men have second kind of certitude that promotes liberation \u2013 viz.: \"I am beyond all\nobjects and beings; I am subtler than the tip of a hair\".\nVI-57. \u2018Best of Brahmins, a third kind of certitude has been affirmed promotive of liberation alone\n(consisting in the thought) \" All this objective world, the entire indestructible universe, is but myself\".\nVI-58. \u2018Also there is a fourth certitude, yielding liberation (that consists of the assertion) \"I and the\nentire world are empty and sky-like at all times\".\nVI-59. \u2018Of these the first is said (to result from) the craving that earns bondage. Those having the last\nthree are sportive, extremely pure and are liberated in this (very) life. Their cravings have been\n(wholly) purified.\n\nVI-60. \u2018Great-souled (sage), the mind seized with the certitude \"I am everything\" is never born again to\ntaste of sorrow !\nVI-61. \u2018that Brahman has been (identified with) emptiness, Prakriti, Maya and also consciousness. It\nhas also been said to be \"Shiva, pure Spirit, the Lord, the eternal and the self\".\nVI-62. \u2018There flourishes but the non-dual Power that is the supreme Self through and through; it\nsportively builds up the universe with (factors) born of (both) duality and non-duality.\nVI-63. \u2018He who resorts to the status beyond all objects, who is through and through the Spirit that is\nperfect, who is neither agitated, nor complacent, never suffers in this empirical life.\nVI-64. \u2018Who performs the actions that fall to his lot, ever viewing foe and friend alike, who is liberated\nfrom both likes and dislikes is neither sad nor hopeful.\nVI-65. \u2018Who utters what pleases all; speaks pleasantly when asked; and who is conversant with the\nthoughts of all beings never suffers in this empirical life.\nVI-66. \u2018Resorting to the primeval vision (of Reality) marked by the renunciation of all objects and Selfestablished, fearlessly roam the world, as a (veritable) Jivanmukta.\nVI-67. \u2018Inwardly shedding all cravings, free from attachment, rid of a(all) latent impressions, (but)\nexternally conforming to established patterns of conduct, fearlessly roam the world.\nVI-68. \u2018Externally simulating enthusiastic activity, but, at heart, free from it all, apparently an agent\n(but) really a non-agent, roam the world with a purified understanding.\nVI-69. \u2018Renouncing egoism, with an apparent reason, shining like the sky, untarnished, roam the world\nwith a purified understanding.\nVI-70. \u2018Elevated, clean of conduct, conforming to established norms of conduct, free from all inner\nclinging, leading, as it were, an empirical life.\nVI-71. \u2018Resorting to the inner Spirit of renunciation, apparently he acts to achieve (some) aim (or\nother). Only small men discriminate saying: One is a relative; the other is a stranger.\nVI-72-73(a). \u2018For those who live magnanimously the entire world constitutes but a family. Resort to the\nstatus free from all considerations of empirical life, beyond old age and death, who are all mental\nconstructions are extinguished and where no attachments finds lodgement.\nVI-73(b). \u2018This is the status of Brahman, absolutely pure, beyond all cravings and sufferings.\nVI-74(a). \u2018Equipped thus and roaming (the earth), one is not vanquished by crisis.\nVI-74(b)-75. \u2018By the prop of detachment and excellences like magnanimity, lift up your mind yourself\nperseveringly in order to enjoy the fruit of Brahmic freedom.\nThrough detachment, it achieves perfection along the path of negation (of the object).\nVI-76-77(a). \u2018(The mind, then) is emptied of all cravings as the pure lake is (of water) in the season of\nautumn.\nWhy is not an intelligent man ashamed of clinging to the same dry routine of insipid actions, day after\nday ?\nVI-77(b). \u2018Bondage is fashioned by consciousness (as subject) and its objects; once free from these,\nliberation follows.\nVI-78. \u2018\"Consciousness (Spirit) is never an object; all is Self\" \u2013 this is the essence of all Vedantic\ndoctrines. Resorting to this sure doctrine, behold (the world), intellectually and freely.\nVI-79. \u2018You will independently achieve the Self, the status of bliss (holding): I am Spirit, these worlds\nare Spirit, the directions (in Space) are Spirit; these manifested beings are Spirit.\nVI-80-81. \u2018\"I am the glory (mahas), devoid of objects and perceptions, wholly pure of form, eternally\nmanifest, rid of all appearances, seer, witness, spirit, free from all objects, the full-orbed light in\nessence, for which no knowables exist, Knowledge pure and simple\".\nVI-82. \"King of sages ! With all mental constructions wiped out, all yearnings abolished, resort to the\nstatus of certitude and be self-established in the Self.\nVI-83. The Brahmin seeker after Truth who dwells upon the Mahopanishad becomes a well versed\nVedic scholar. (If) uninitiated, he becomes initiated; he becomes purified by fire, by air, by the sun, by\n\nthe moon, by Truth, by all agents of purification. He becomes known to all gods; is cleaned (as if he\nhas dipped) in all sacred waters. He dwells in the thoughts of all gods. He has (as it were) performed all\nsacrifices. To him accrue the fruits of having repeated the Gayatri sixty thousand times; of having\nrepeated Itihasa and Puranas and Srirudra a Lac of times; of having repeated Omkara ten thousand\ntimes. He hollows the rows (of living beings) as far as the eye reaches; and seven generations both in\nthe past and in the future.

What is hard is earth, what is liquid is\nwater, what is hot is fire, what moves is air, what is porous is space.\nThe organs of sense are ear etc.: the ear is in the sky (space), the sense of touch (skin) is in the air, the\neye in the fire, tongue in water, smell in earth. Thus for the senses sound etc., are the objects.\nThe organs of action are: tongue, hands, feet, arms and genitals. Their objects are: speech, catching,\nwalking, voiding and joy. These have arisen from earth etc., respectively.\nMind, Intellect, Egoism and Self-conscious mind are the four inner senses. Their scopes are volition\nand doubt, determination, affection, decision. The mind is at the tip of the neck, intellect at the face,\negoism at the heart, self-conscious mind at the navel.\nBone, skin, nerves, hair, flesh are parts of earth; urine, phlegm, blood, semen are of water; hunger,\nthirst, laziness, delusion and sex of fire; circulation, bursting, movement of the eye etc., of air; lust,\nanger, greed, delusion and fear are of ether.\nEarth\u2019s attributes are Sound, Touch, Form, Taste and Smell; of water: sound, touch, form and taste; of\nfire are: sound, touch and form; of air: sound and touch; of ether: sound only.\nNon-violence, truth, non-theft, continence and non-possession, absence of anger, service to elders,\ncleanliness, contentment and honesty, non-conceit, candour, faith and non-injury \u2013 are the qualities\n(effects) of Sattva.\nI am the doer, enjoyer, speaker, am conceited \u2013 these are of Rajas. Sleep, laziness, delusion, attachment,\nsex and theft \u2013 these are of Tamas. The person of Sattva is above, of Rajas is in the middle and of\n\nTamas, low. Right knowledge is Sattvika; of rituals, Rajasa; blindness, Tamasa.\nFirst the waking state rests on the five organs of sense, the five of action and the four inner senses\n(being active). Dream depends on the four inner senses only; dreamless sleep has only mind as active\ninstrument; the fourth state has only the soul (active).\nThe knower is the empirical self, other than the supreme, stationed between awareness (of object) and\nindifference (to them).\nThe five organs of sense and action with the five vital airs, the mind and intellect, go to make the\nLingasarira. Mind, intellect, self-conscious principle, earth etc., are the eight Prakritis. There are\nsixteen others; the transformations of ear, skin, eyes, tongue, and nose; arms, genitals, hands, feet,\nvocal organ; sound, touch, form, taste and smell. The twenty-three are the Tattvas (eternal verities)\nrelating to Prakriti.\nThe twenty-fourth is the Avyakta, the chief (Tattva).

    "Yogasikha": "\nYoga Sikha Upanishad\nTranslated by P. R. Ramachander\nPublished by celextel.org\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nFirst Chapter\n\u201cAll the living beings are surrounded by the net of illusion, Oh God, Parameshwara, Oh God of Gods,\nHow will they attain salvation? Be kind enough to tell.\u201d Asked Lord Brahma to Lord Parameshwara\nand he replied as follows: 1.1\nSome people say that the only way out is Jnana (knowledge). To attain occult powers, that alone will\nnot suffice. How can Jnana without Yoga lead to salvation? It is also true that Yoga alone without Jnana\nwill not lead to salvation. So the one who aims at salvation, should learn Jnana and Yoga together. 1.2\nLike a rope ties a bird, the minds of all living beings are tied. Enquiries and researches do not affect the\ntie of this mind. So the only way to win over this mind is through victory over Prana. There is no other\noption to get victory over Prana except Yoga and there are no methods except those shown by Siddhas.\n1.3\nSo I am teaching you this Yoga Shika (head of all yogas). It is greater than all Jnanas. After sitting in\neither Padmasana (lotus position) or any other Asana, and after concentrating the sight to the tip of the\nnose and after controlling both the hands and legs, meditate on the letter \u2018Om\u2019 with a concentrated\nmind. If one continuously meditates on Parameshwara, he would become an expert in yoga and the\n\nParameshwara would appear before him. 1.4\nIf we sit in an asana and continuously practice, the bindu will cease from going down. Without Pooraka\nand Rechaka, the Prana would stand in Kumbhaka for a very long time. You would hear different types\nof sound. The nectar will start flowing from the place of the moon. Hunger and thirst will cease. Mind\nwould get concentrated on the ever flowing bliss. The four steps for this are Mantra Yoga, Laya Yoga,\nHatha Yoga and Raja Yoga. The great Maha Yoga, which is one, has been divided in to four and named\nas above. The prana goes out with sound \u201cham\u201d and goes in with the word \u201csa\u201d, and all beings\nnaturally chant the mantra \u201cHamsa, Hamsa\u201d (while exhaling and inhaling). This is chanted in the\nSushumna after being taught by the Guru in an inverted manner (Hamsa inverted is soham). This\nchanting of the mantra \u201cSoham, Soham (I am it)\" is called Mantra Yoga. Sun is the letter \u201cHa\u201d and\nmoon is the letter \u201cTha\u201d. The joining of sun and the moon is the Hatha Yoga. Due to Hatha Yoga, the\nidiocy which is the cause of all doshas (draw backs) is swallowed. When the merging of Jeevatma and\nParamatma takes place, mind melts and vanishes. And only air of Prana remains. This is called Laya\nYoga. Because of Laya Yoga that heavenly Swathmananda Sowkhya (the well being of the joy of ones\nown soul) is attained. In the great temple of the middle of yoni (the female organ) the principle of the\nDevi, which is red like Hibiscus flower lives as Rajas in all beings. The merger of this rajas with the\nmale principle is called Raja Yoga. As a result of Raja Yoga, the Yogi gets all the occult powers like\nAnima. You have to understand that all these four types of Yogas are nothing but the merger of Prana,\nApana and Samana. 1.5\nFor all those who have a body, their body is the temple of Shiva. It can give them occult powers. The\ntriangular part in between the anus and penis is called the mooladhara. This is the place where Shiva\nlives as a life giving force. There the Parashakthi called Kundalani lives. From there wind is produced.\nThe fire is also produced from there. From there only the sound \u2018Hamsa\u2019 and the mind are also\nproduced. This place which would give whatever is asked for is called Kamakhya peetam (the seat of\npassion). In the edge of the anus is the Swadishtana Chakra with six petals. Near the belly is the Mani\nPoora Chakra with its ten petals. In the place near the heart the Anahatha Chakra with its 12 petals\nexists. And, Hey Lord Brahma, this is called the Poorna Giri Peeta. In the depression in the throat,\nVishudhi Chakra with its 16 petals exists. Hey lord of Lords, that is the Jalandara Chakra. In between\nthe eyelids is the Agna Chakra with its two petals. Over that is the Maha Peeta called Udayana. 1.6\nSecond Chapter\nThis world functions because of the unclear foundation power which is described as Maha Maya, Maha\nLakshmi, Maha Devi and Maha Saraswathi. That power shines in a micro form as a Bindu (dot) on the\nPeeta (seat). That Bindu breaks the Peeta and emerges from there in the form of Nadha (sound). That\nNadha Brahma assumes three shapes viz., Macro, Micro and external. The macro form is the big shape\nwhich is pervaded by the five Brahmans. The micro form which arises from the Nadha with its three\nBheejas (roots) is the form of Hiranya Garbha. Para is the ever true property of Satchitananda. By\ncontinuously chanting the Atma mantra, the glitter will occur in Para Thathwa (the philosophy of the\nexternal). For the Yogi who has stopped his mind, this appears in the micro form similar to the flame of\nthe lamp, moon\u2019s crescent, like a fire fly, like a streak of lightning and like the glitter of stars. There are\nno greater mantras than Nadha (sound), no Gods greater than Atma, no greater worship than the\nmeditation and no pleasure greater than satisfaction. My devotee who understands this would remain\nstable in his happiness. To that great man who has great devotion to God as well as similar great\ndevotion to his teacher, all this would be understood automatically.\nThird Chapter\n\nThat great ever living Nadha (sound) is called Sabhda Brahman. It is the strength residing in the\nMooladhara. Para is the foundation for its own self and is of the form of Bindhu. That Nadha coming\nout of Parashakthi (similar to the germ coming out of the seed) is called Pasyanthi (we see). The Yogis\nwho are able to see using the Pasyanthi Shakthi, understand that it is the whole world. That power\nproduces sound like a rain starting from the heart. Hey Lord of Lords, there it is called Madhyama. It is\ncalled Vaikari when it merges in the sound form with Prana and exists in the throat and jaw. It produces\nall the alphabets from Aa to Ksha. From alphabet words arise and from words rise the sentences and\nfrom them all the Vedas and Mantras. This Goddess Saraswathi lives in the cave of intelligence in all\nbeings. In meditation when will power melts, you can reach this Para Thathwa.\nFourth Chapter\nBecause the divine power is single, there are no differences there. You have to understand that the\nthought process of living beings is like seeing a snake in a rope. When you do not know, it is a rope and\nthen for a small time the rope appears as a snake. The ordinary intelligence is similar to this. We see\neverything as the world that we see. There is no reason or basis for this world to be different from this\nBrahman. So the World is only Brahman and not anything different. If you understand the Para\nThathwa like this, where is the cause for differentiation. 4.1\nIn Taittiriya Upanishad fear has been told as belonging to that foolish person who finds difference\nbetween Jeevatma(soul) and Paramatma (God). Though this world has been told as some thing to be\nexperienced, in the next moment it vanishes like a dream. There is no state of waking up in a dream.\nThere is no dream in the state of waking up. Both of them are not there in Laya. Laya is not in both of\nthem. All these three are illusions created by the three characters. The one who sees this would be\nabove characteristics and would be forever. 4.2\nThe Chaithanya (activity) starts in the form of the world. All these are Brahman. It is useless to\ndifferentiate it as Atma and Anatma when dealing with wise people. The foolish man thinks that body is\nattached to the soul. The belief that pot is mixed with the mud and the water is mixed with mirage and\nsimilarly the belief that body is mixed up with the soul is because of taking recourse to ignorance. 4.3\nFifth Chapter\nThat Yogi who has mastered yoga and who has complete control over his senses would attain whatever\nhe imagines. The Teacher (guru) is the Brahma, He is Vishnu and He is the Lord of Lords Sadashiva\nand there is nobody greater than the teacher in all the three worlds. We should worship with devotion\nthat Parameshwara, who is the great Soul who has taught us the divine knowledge. The one who\nworships like that would get the result of Jnana fully. Do not keep your aim because of the wavering\nmind on occult powers. The one who knows this principle well, is the one who has attained salvation.\nThere is no doubt about it.\nSixth Chapter\nThat great light in which the Bhoo Loka, Bhuvar Loka and Suvar Loka [Worlds] and the Sun, Moon\nand Fire Gods, are but a small part in the letter \u201cOm\u201d. When mind wavers, the worldly life and when it\nis firm, the salvation will result. So Lord Brahma, using great intelligence we have to keep the mind not\nto waver. For desire to posses wealth, the mind is the reason. When that is destroyed, the world would\nbe destroyed. One should with lot of effort start the treatment for that. When a man looks after his mind\n\nusing his mind and realizes that it has stopped running, he would see the Parabrahman, which is very\ndifficult to see. The Yogi is able to get salvation by seeing his mind with his mind. We have to see the\nmind with the mind and hanker for that mad state. We have to see the mind with the mind and be stable\nin Yoga. 6.1\nIn any place where the wind moves, the mind also wavers. Mind is called moon, sun, wind, sight and\nfire. The Bindu(dot), Nadha (sound) and the Kala (crescent) are the Gods Vishnu, Brahma and Ishwara.\nBy constant practice of Nadha, the bad influences will vanish. That which is Nadha becomes the Bindu\nand then becomes the mind. One has to clearly aim at the unification of Nadha, Bindu and Chintha.\nMind itself is the Bindu and that is the reason for the state of creation of the world. Similar to milk\nbeing produced by the cow, Bindu is produced by the mind. 6.2\nThe one who realizes well the six wheels (Agna chakras) enters the world of pleasure. One has to enter\nit by controlling the airs in the body. One has to send the air (Vayu) upwards. One has to practice Vayu,\nBindu Chakra and Chintha. Once the Yogi realizes Samadhi by one of them, he feels that everything is\nnectar like. Similar to the fact that the fire inside the wood cannot be brought out without churning it by\nanother wood, without practice, the lamp of wisdom can not be lit. Adopting his teacher as the one who\npilots the ship and by adopting his teachings as the stable ship, with the power of constant practice, one\ncrosses the sea of this birth. Thus tells this Upanishad.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Yoga-Sikhopanishad belonging to the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",

Now the grandfather of all people (the god Brahma) respectfully approaching his father, Adinarayana\n(Lord Vishnu) said, \u2018What is the path of the Avadhutas after the Turiyatita stage, and what is their\nstanding ?\u2019 To him replied the Lord Narayana: Wise sages consider that one who remains in the path of\nthe Avadhuta is very rare in the world and (such sages) are not many; if one becomes (an Avadhuta) he\nis ever pure, he is indeed the embodiment of dispassion; he is indeed the visible form of wisdom and he\nis indeed the personification of the Veda (Vedapurusha). He is a (truly) great man, as his mind abides in\nme alone. Indeed I too abide in him. In due order, having been first a hut-dwelling ascetic (Kutichaka),\nhe reaches the stage of a mendicant monk (Bahudaka); the mendicant monk attains to the stage of a\nHamsa ascetic; the Hamsa ascetic (then) becomes the highest kind of ascetic (Paramahamsa). (In this\nstage) by introspection he realizes the entire world (as non-different from his Self); renouncing all\npersonal possessions in (a reservoir of) waters, (such things as) his emblematic staff, water pot, waist\nband, loincloth that covers (his privities) and all ritualistic duties enjoined on him (in a previous stage);\nbecoming unclad (lit. clothed by the points of the compass); abandoning even the acceptance of a\ndiscoloured, worn out bark garment or (deer) skin; behaving thereafter (after the stage of the\nParamahamsa) as one subject to no mantras (i.e. performing no rituals) and gives up shaving, oil bath,\nthe perpendicular mark of sandal paste on the forehead, etc.\n2. He is one terminating all religious and secular duties; free of religious merit or otherwise in all\nsituations; giving up both knowledge and ignorance; conquering (the influence of) cold and heat,\nhappiness and misery, honour and dishonour; having burnt up in advance, with the latent influence\n\n(vasana) of the body, etc., censure, praise, pride, rivalry, ostentation, haughtiness, desire, hatred, love,\nanger, covetousness, delusion, (gloating) joy, intolerance, envy, clinging to life, etc.; viewing his body\nas a corpse, as it were; becoming equanimous effortlessly and unrestrainedly in gain or loss; sustaining\nhis life (with food placed in the mouth) like a cow; (satisfied) with (food) as it comes without ardently\nlonging for it; reducing to ashes the host of learning and scholarship; guarding his conduct (without\nvaunting his noble way of life); disowning the superiority or inferiority (of any one); (firmly)\nestablished in non-duality (of the Self) which is the highest (principle) of all and which comprises all\nwithin itself; cherishing the conviction, \u2018There is nought else distinct from me\u2019; absorbing in the Self\nthe fuel (of concept) other than the secret known only by the gods; untouched by sorrow; unresponsive\nto (worldly) happiness; free of desire for affection; unattached everywhere to the auspicious or the\ninauspicious; with (the functioning of) all senses at standstill; unmindful of the superiority of his\nconduct, learning and moral merit (dharma) acquired in the previous stages of his life; giving up the\nconduct befitting caste and stage of life (Vanaprastha); dreamless, as night and day are the same to him;\never on the move everywhere; remaining with the body alone left to him; his water-pot being the\nwatering-place (only); ever sensible (but) wandering alone as though he were a child, madman or\nghost; always observing silence and deeply meditating on his Self, he has for his support the propless\n(Brahman); forgetting everything (else) in consonance with the absorption in his Self; this Turiyatita\nsage reaching the state of the Avadhuta ascetic and completely absorbed in non-duality (of the Atman)\n(finally) gives up his body as he has become one with Om (the Pranava): such an ascetic is an\nAvadhuta; he has accomplished his life\u2019s purpose. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm !

He who in due order (of the stages of life)\ngives up (the primary inclinations such as the desire for wealth, etc.,) becomes one who has renounced\n(worldly life). What is this called renunciation ? How does one renounce ? One who guards himself by\nthe (following) activities, who has (for his renunciation) the approval of mother, father, wife, sons and\nkinsmen should assemble all the officiating priests known to him and as before (with their approval)\nperform the Vaishvanara sacrifice (for the welfare of all people). He shall (after partition) give away all\nhis wealth to the officiating priests. For the priests are the singers (of the Vedic hymns, deserving the\ngift). The (five) vital airs, Prana, Apana, Vyana, Udana and Samana, shall be (symbolically) placed in\nall the sacrificial vessels over the (five) sacred fires, the ahavaniya, garhapatya, anvaharyapachana,\nsabhya and avasathya. Shaving off his hair along with the tuft, snapping the sacred thread and seeing\nhis son, he shall consecrate (himself) with the mantras \u2018You are the god Brahma, you are the sacrifice,\nyou are everything\u2019. If he has no son he should consecrate himself thus and not minding (anything)\nproceed as a mendicant monk eastward or northward.\nHe may receive alms from (people of the) four castes. He should eat from the vessel of his hands. He\n\nshall consider food as medicine. He should take food as medicine (i.e. in great moderation). He should\neat as and when he gets (food, without discontent and not asking for more, like Oliver Twist) for bare\nsustenance and in such a way that there is no increase of fat. Having grown lean he may shelter one\nnight in a village, five nights in a town; he may reside during the four rainy months in a village or\ntown. (Interpreting) fortnights as months, he may reside (in a fixed abode) for two months. If he is\nunable to endure (heat or cold) he may accept as gift a tattered garment or bark dress. He shall not\naccept any other. For penance is to suffer pain (with equanimity). What then is the sacred thread, the\ntuft and the ceremonial sipping of water to one who thus renounces in the prescribed manner and who\nthus views it (in the correct perspective) ? To him (the questioner) is this reply. This is his sacred thread\n(namely) that he meditates on the Atman; the (practice of) Brahma-vidya is the tuft; that he quenches\nhis thirst with the vessel of his belly accomplishes (the ceremonial) duty with water that is present\neverywhere. His residence is at the bank of (a reservoir of) water. When the sun has set, how can he\n(ceremoniously) sip water ? As (he touches water) during day, so at night; (for) he has neither night nor\nday. (The enlightened ascetic is above the restrictions of time). This has been said by the Vedic sage (in\na mantra): \u2018To him there is (only) one (time), the day.\u2019 He who knows thus realizes the Atman through\nthis (renunciation).\nSECOND ADHYAYA\n1. That person alone is entitled to renunciation who has undergone the forty purificatory rites\n(samskaras), has detachment from all (worldly) things, has acquired purity of mind, has burnt out\ndesires, envy, intolerance and egotism, and is equipped with the four disciplines of spiritual life\n(sadhanas).\n2. Having resolved on renunciation he who does not embrace it shall perform the penance (Prajapatya)\nalone (as an atonement); thereafter he is entitled to renounce (the world).\n3. One who (having resolved on renunciation, later) denounces it, one who supports a fallen ascetic (as\nif he were genuine), and one who throws obstacles (in the path of those desiring renunciation) \u2013 these\nthree (classes of people) are to be known as fallen.\n4. Now these (persons, though possessing dispassion, are not entitled to renunciation \u2013 a eunuch, a\nfallen man, a maimed person, women, a deaf person, a child, a dumb person, a heretic, an informer, a\nstudent (who has not completed his study), a Vaikhanasa anchorite (belonging to a Vaishnava sect), an\nardent Saivite (Haradvija), a salaried teacher, a man without prepuce and one without ritual fire. Even if\nthey renounce the world they are not entitled to instruction in the great scriptural texts (such as 'That\nThou Art').\n5. The son of one who has fallen from ascetic grace, one having disease of the nails, one who is brown\ntoothed, a consumptive, as well as a deformed person \u2013 these are never entitled to renounce.\n6. One should never allow renunciation to those who have just settled as house-holders, those who have\ncommitted great sins, those who have lost caste due to non-performance of the principal purificatory\nrites (vratyas) and the accursed.\n7. (Again) one should never allow renunciation to one who is devoid of religious observances, religious\nacts (yajnas), penance, charity, offering, oblations in ritual fire and study of scripture; and those fallen\nfrom truth and purity. These do not deserve to renounce; (and no one) can dispense with the due order\nexcept one sorely afflicted.\n8. The person (entitled to renounce) should discard his tuft reciting \u2018Om Bhuh Svaha\u2019. Saying the\nmantra \u2018The sacred thread shall not remain externally. Grant me fame, strength, spiritual wisdom,\ndispassion and intelligence\u2019, he shall snap the sacred thread and leave it in the waters along with his\ngarment and waist-band muttering \u2018Om Svaha\u2019; then he should repeat thrice, \u2018I have renounced\u2019.\n9. Seeing a Brahmana who has renounced the world the sun moves from his place (thinking), \u2018This\nperson will reach Brahman breaking through my disc\u2019.\n10. That wise man who says \u2018I have renounced\u2019 raises to glory sixty generations of his family before\n\nhim and sixty generations after him.\n11. All the defects born of bad sons and all defects born of bodily weakness, the Praisa fire (at the time\nof renouncing) shall burn out, just as the fire of chaff does to gold.\n12. (Reciting the mantra) \u2018Friend, guard me\u2019, he (the renouncer) shall accept the (emblematic) staff.\n13. The ascetic should bear a staff which shall be of bamboo, smooth, whole (with the bark), of even\njoints, grown in holy ground and cleaned of all defects;\n14. It shall be unscarred (by forest fire), uninjured by worms, shining with its joints, (of length)\nreaching upto the nose, head or the eyebrows.\n15. Close association is always enjoined between the staff and the person; a wise man shall not move\nwithout the staff a distance three times that of an arrow-throw.\n16. Reciting the mantra \u2018You are the receptacle of water which sustains the world; never say nay to me,\nyou who are always agreeable to all\u2019, he should receive the water vessel; and invested with the yogic\ngarment (as aid to meditation) he shall go about in an agreeable frame of mind.\n17. Give up (concepts of) righteousness and unrighteousness (dharma and adharma), give up both truth\nand untruth; having given up both truth and untruth discard that by which you abandon (all these) (i.e.\nduality).\n18. Ascetic due to dispassion, ascetic due to spiritual wisdom, ascetic due to wisdom and dispassion\nand ascetic due to renunciation of action; these are the four kinds (of ascetics) obtained.\n19. This is how it is. He is the ascetic due to dispassion who has become indifferent to sensory objects\nthat are seen or heard of and who has renounced (the world) due to the influence of good actions done\npreviously.\n20. He alone is the ascetic due to Jnana, who, being dead to worldly life due to the (true) knowledge of\nthe scripture and listening to the experiences of the people in sin and goodness and who, having\ndiscarded lingering attachment to the body, scripture and the world and considering as worthless like\nvomit all worldly actions, possesses the fourfold discipline in spiritual life and then renounces the\nworld.\n21. Having studied in the prescribed manner all (scripture) and experienced all (vicissitudes of) life he\nis the ascetic due to Jnana and dispassion who has his body alone left to him by meditation on the\nnature of the Self due to Jnana and dispassion and then renounces and becomes unclad (as he was when\nborn).\n22. Having completed the period of celibate studentship, becoming a house-holder and then embracing\nthe stage of forest life (Vanaprastha), he, who renounces (the world) only in order to observe the order\nof the stages of life even though without dispassion, is the ascetic who renounces action.\n23. Renunciation is of six kinds: (and the ascetics are called) Kutichaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa,\nParamahamsa, Turiyatita and Avadhuta.\n24. The Kutichaka ascetic has tuft and sacred thread, bears a staff and water vessel, wears a loin-cloth\nand patched garment, is devoted to the service of father, mother and preceptor, is equipped with a\nvessel, spade, sling, etc., alone, is addicted to eating food in one place, wears on the forehead a\nperpendicular mark of white sandal and holds a threefold (emblematic) staff.\n25. The Bahudaka ascetic wears tuft, etc., patched garment and three (horizontal) lines of holy ash on\nhis forehead and is similar in all respects to the Kutichaka ascetic (except) that he subsists on eight\nmouthfuls of food gathered (as alms from eight houses), as a bee (does honey).\n26. The Hamsa ascetic wears matter hair, puts on the forehead the mark of either the horizontal lines of\nholy ash or the perpendicular one of sandal, subsists on food gathered as alms without restriction and\nwears a piece of loin-cloth.\n27. The Paramahamsa ascetic is devoid of tuft and sacred thread, receives alms in the vessel of his\nhands, wears a single loin-cloth, has a single (patched) garment, one bamboo staff, either wears a single\ngarment or is smeared with holy ashes and has discarded all (possessions and attachments).\n28. The Turiyatita ascetic subsists of fruits receiving them in his mouth like a cow; if he eats cooked\n\nrice (he receives them as alms) from three houses. He has his body alone left to him (without any\npossessions and attachment), is unclad (dressed by the points of the compass) and treats his body as if it\nwere a corpse.\n29. The Avadhuta ascetic has no fixed rules. He eats food like a python as and when he gets it, from\npersons of all castes except those who are fallen or accursed and is ever intent on meditation on the\nnature of the Self.\n30. I am not surely of this world consisting of trees, grass and mountains. How can I, the supreme\nBeing, be this external (phenomenon) which is intensely inert ? I am not the body which is non-sentient\nand perishable in a short time.\n31. I am not the sound which is non-sentient, coming from void and of the form of void and which\nremains for a short period grasped by the inert cavity of the ear.\n32. I am not the touch which is non-sentient but which has life granted to it by the favour of\nconsciousness and which can be experienced by skin of momentary existence and in no other way.\n33. I am not the taste which is non-sentient, dependent on matter and of short duration, insignificant\nand brought into existence by the fickle tongue aided by the fickle mind.\n34. I am not the form (rupa) which is non-sentient, non-existent in the sole Witness (Brahman),\nperishable and which rests on sight and the object of sight which have but momentary existence.\n35. I am not the smell which is non-sentient, subtle and of indefinable form and brought into existence\nby the perishable nose which is dead to smell.\n36. I am pure consciousness alone which is devoid of parts, \u2018mine-ness\u2019 and thought and which is\nquiescent and beyond the delusions of the five senses.\n37. I am consciousness alone, devoid of a place of worship, and am illuminator, omnipresent\n(externally and internally), devoid of parts and stain, the light of distinctionless consciousness, allpervading and one alone.\n38. It is only by me, the consciousness, that all things such as pots and garments up to the sun are\nillumined by self-effulgence as by a lamp.\n39. It is only by me, with my inwardly shining effulgence, that the various senses are active just as the\nmass of sparks shine due to fire which is blazing within.\n40. This pure eye of consciousness, which enjoys endless bliss and which shines even when all others\nare extinct, is victoriously present in all eyes.\n41. Salutation, salutation to myself alone who am present in all other beings and consist of\nconsciousness free from (the restriction of) an object to be known and am of the form of the individual\nSelf (consciousness).\n42. The various clearly seen powers (such as those of earth, etc.,) are (really) rendered variegated by\nconsciousness which is free of change, one whole and free from the limitation of time and parts (kala).\n43. Of consciousness which is beyond the three durations (of past, present and future), is devoid of the\nrestriction of perceivability of objects and which discards individuality of the soul, there remains the\noneness alone (of the Self and Brahman).\n44. Indeed the same (consciousness), being beyond the reach of words, seems to remain as having\nreached the state of the conclusion of Selfishness, (i.e. the state of non-duality), as if it were eternal\nnon-existence.\n45. The same consciousness, slightly encompassed by impurities of desires and non-desires, is unable\nto rise high like a female bird bound by a string.\n46. People (overcome) by the delusion (caused by) the pairs (of opposites), which is born of desire and\nhatred, become similar to worms which are sunk in the cavities of the earth.\n47. Salutation to the Atman, to you, who are non-different from consciousness. I am now seized (of the\ntruth), I am awakened, I have risen (above delusion).\n48. I am lifted up from doubts; I am what I am; salutation to you, to your and to me, the eternal; to you\nand to me consisting of consciousness.\n\n49. Salutation to you, the supreme God and salutation to me, the Shiva. Though seated (the Atman) is\nnot seated, though going he does not go. Though quiescent he is engaged in activities, though\nperforming action he is not tainted.\n50. He is eminently accessible, he is easily known like a close kinsman; he is the bee in the interior of\nthe lotus of the body of all.\n51. I have no desire for the state of enjoyment nor for abandoning enjoyment. Let come what may, let\ngo what may.\n52. When the mind is quelled in itself and has become free of egotism and when ideation is dissolved in\nitself I remain, alone, happy.\n53. My enemy (duality) remains (i.e. is absorbed) in the pure Atman of vibration alone, without\nideation, egotism, mind and desire.\n54. Breaking the bonds of intense desires from the cage of my body I know not where the female bird\nof non-ego has flown up and gone.\n55. He who has no egotism, whose intellect is not tainted, and who is equanimous to all beings \u2013 his\nlife shines bright.\n56. He who looks at this (phenomenal world) like (an impartial) witness with his mind, being cool\nwithin, is freed of love and hatred, has his life blessed.\n57. He who, understanding correctly, abandons both the undesirables and the desirables and places his\nmind in its quiescence, has his life blessed.\n58. When the connecting link between the object and the person (who grasps it) has vanished peace\ncomes well into being. When peace has established itself, it is called liberation.\n59. Like parched seeds there is no more sprouting of worldly birth; the latent desires become pure in\nthe heart of those who are liberated while living.\n60. (Latent desire of a realized soul) is purifying, highly proper, falls within the scope of pure nature,\nconsists of meditation on the Atman and is eternal; it remains as if in deep sleep.\n61. Understanding without the mind is indeed said to be the individual consciousness. As it is of the\nnature of the quiescent mind there is not the impurity of comprehension (of distinctions).\n62. Where the mind is rendered quiescent, there is truth and auspiciousness; its is the true state; it is\nomniscience and it is indeed complete satisfaction.\n63. When speaking, giving, taking, opening and closing the eyes, I am purely consciousness, the bliss\n(that comes of) discarded thinking process.\n64. Having discarded the impurity of things to be known, rendering the mind thoroughly quiescent and\ncutting off the fire of the bond of desire, I am pure consciousness alone.\n65. I have set at rest thoughts good and bad, am without worry, rid of ideation of the pleasant and the\nunpleasant; I am pure consciousness alone.\n66. Discarding the idea of oneself and another, taking no sides in worldly happenings and clinging to\nthe Atman, as an adamantine pillar I am steady.\n67. I remain in my consciousness which is pure and without hopes, freed from desires and non-desires\nand devoid of both the undesirable and the desirables.\n68. When shall I get the inward joy while remaining in the state of self-luminosity ? When shall I be in\na mountain cave with my mind quiescent ?\n69. When shall I attain similarity to a stone by (practising) distinctionless deep meditation (NirvikalpaSamadhi) when, while remaining dumb by the peace of partless meditation, birds of the forest will\nbuild their leafy nests on my head ?\n70. Having cut the trees of ideation and the creepers of intense desire of the forest of the mind and\nhaving reached the broad plains (of spiritual wisdom), I enjoy life happily.\n71. I follow that path (of wisdom), I am alone (unencumbered with attachments), I am successful (in\nrealizing the truth); I am liberated, I am without desire, I am partless and I desire nothing.\n72-73. The states of purity, strength, reality, heartiness, truth, true, knowledge, bliss, tranquillity, the\n\nrise of constant joy, fullness, true richness, the possession of effulgence and true oneness \u2013 the\nmendicant monk thus thinking on the true nature of his Self and realizing his true nature freedom\ndoubts, indeed became the one without an alternative (i.e. became one with Brahman).\n74. If one sorely afflicted recovers, renunciation in the prescribed order should be embraced. (An\nascetic) shall not converse with a low caste woman, one fallen from virtue, and a woman in he courses.\nThe ascetic has no worship of gods, nor witnessing (temple) festivals. The goal of asceticism is not one\n(and the same) heaven. The sorely afflicted and the Kutichaka ascetics gain the worlds Bhur and the\nBhuvas respectively. The Bahudaka ascetic (gains) heaven (Svarga). The Hamsa ascetic, the world of\ntruth (Satya-loka). The Turiyatita and the Avadhuta ascetics attain supreme bliss in themselves by\ndeeply meditating on the true nature of the Self according to the maxim of the wasp.\n75. The practice of Scripture-study, which is distinct from meditation on the nature of the Self, is\nuseless like (carrying( saffron flowers which are but a burden to a camel. The ascetic has not to practise\nthe science of Yoga or the Sankhya; he has no rituals with mantras and tantras nor the study of any\nother religious treatise (Shastra); if there is, it is like adorning a corpse. (Such an ascetic) is far away\nfrom spiritual lore like a cobbler. A mendicant monk shall not mention his name (in the previous stage\nof life). One reaps the fruit of whatever action one does. (Hence the ascetic) shall give up all, as one\nwould (discard) the foam on castor oil. There is no receiving of the offerings made to a deity. He shall\nnot worship gods externally.\n76. Discarding everything apart from the Self, subsisting on food secured as alms from a number of\nhouses (as a bee gathers honey), being lean and avoiding increase of fat (in his body) he shall move\nabout. He should spend the time, (eating food) secured as alms from a number of houses using his hand\nor mouth as a vessel.\n77. The sage established in the Self should take food which is conducive to (the realization of) the Self.\nTwo quarters (of the belly shall be filled) with food and one quarter with water; the fourth quarter shall\nbe left for the movement of air.\n78. He shall always live on alms; he shall never eat food secured as alms from one house alone; he\nshould go particularly to those houses where the people are seen to be easy in mind (i.e. those who dine\nonly after giving alms).\n79. He may expect alms from four or seven houses (where the house-holder) perform religious rites; he\nmay expect (alms) up to the period of milking cows (in the afternoon); when he has come out (of a\nhouse without alms) he shall not go in again.\n80. Fasting is preferable to (getting food from) devotees; unsolicited food is better than fasting; begging\nalms is preferable to unsolicited food; hence he shall subsist on alms.\n81. He shall never enter a house by a side entrance at the time of begging alms; he shall not out of\ndelusion go across a house where no harm is seen in so doing.\n82. He shall not beg alms from a Vedic scholar if it is (given) without faith and devotion; he may beg\nalms from the house of a twice-born who has lost caste when offered with faith and devotion.\n83. Alms from a number of houses without planning, that which is planned, the one unbegged, the\ntimely one and the one offered (at the monastery) are declared to be the five kinds of alms.\n84. (The first kind), alms from a number of houses, is declared to be that which is obtained from there,\nfive or seven houses without pre-meditation as in the case of a honeybee (from flowers).\n85. (The second kind), alms previously arranged, is that which is accepted after repeated requests made\nby devotees in that morning and the previous day; none the less he may subsist on that.\n86. (The third kind), alms unbegged is that which is received when invited to dine by some one or other\nas he is ready to go abegging; this should be eaten by ascetics (desiring salvation).\n87. (The fourth kind) timely alms is known as that (meal) which is offered by a Brahmana when he has\napproached (a house) for alms; this (food) should be eaten by ascetics.\n88. Sages desiring liberation say that the (fifth kind of) alms, the food offered (to the ascetic at the\nmonastery) is the ready meal which is brought by a Brahmana to the monastery.\n\n89. The ascetic shall subsist on alms by begging from door to door even though it may be from the\nhouses of outcastes. He shall not dine in one house even if (the host) is equal to the preceptor of the\ngods (in learning). He shall subsist on alms, solicited or unsolicited.\n90. Air is not spoiled by touching (any object); fire by the activity of burning; waters, by urine and\nfaeces (getting into them); and a mendicant monk by short-comings in food.\n91. When (in houses) smoke has subsided, the pestle (for pounding rice) is at rest, the fire (in the oven)\nhas gone out and the people have dined, (the ascetic) shall go for alms in the late afternoon.\n92. He shall receive alms except from the accursed, the fallen, heretics and the class of people\nexclusively engaged in temple worship; from all the castes, in difficult times.\n93-94. (He shall consider) clarified butter as dog\u2019s urine, honey as spirituous liquor, oil as hog\u2019s urine,\ncondiment as garlic, cakes made of black gram as beef, and milk as urine. Therefore the ascetic shall\navoid, by putting forth all effort, clarified butter, etc.\n95. The Yogin shall never eat food mixed with clarified butter, condiments, etc.; using his hand as a\nvessel he shall not go about for alms more than once (a day).\n96. When the ascetic seeks food with his mouth (alone) like a cow, he becomes equanimous to all;\n(hence) he becomes fit for immortality.\n97. (The ascetic) shall discard clarified butter like blood, taking food in one house like flesh, using\ncosmetics like smearing himself with unclean things, salt and molasses like an outcaste, garment like\ndirty dishes, oil bath like courting women, pleasant company of friends like urine, desire like beef,\nfamiliar places like the hut of an outcaste, women like snakes, gold like deadly poison, an assembly\nhall like a cemetery, the capital (city) like hell and food in one house like the balls of rice at a funeral.\nThere is no worship of gods (by him). Discarding the way of the world he shall become one \u2018liberated\nwhile living\u2019.\n98. Stay (continuously in one place), acquisition of (begging) bowl, collecting (of staff, etc.,), gathering\ndisciples, sleep by day time (divasvapnah) and useless talk \u2013 these are the six sins of ascetics.\n99-103. Remaining (continuously in one place) except during the rains is said to be a stay (asana).\nAcquisition of even a single vessel like the afore-said vessel of gourd, etc., for daily use by an ascetic is\nsaid to be \u2018acquiring vessels\u2019 (patralopa). Collecting (samchaya) is declared to be the acceptance of a\nsecond staff, etc., for future use by one who has one already. The acceptance of disciples for personal\nservice, profit, dignity or fame and not out of compassion (to help them) is said to be gathering\ndisciples (sishyasamgraha). (Vedantic) learning is (called) day as it is illuminating; ignorance (avidya)\nis said to be night. Negligence in learning is said to be \u2018sleep during day\u2019 divasvapnah). Excepting talk\npertaining to the Self and at the time of receiving alms, (bestowal of) blessings and inquiries\n(concerning the Self), any other talk is said to be useless talk (vrithajalpah).\n104. Food from one house, pride, envy, adorning with cosmetics and flowers, chewing betel roll, oil\nbath, sport, desire for enjoyment, medicine to prolong life and retard old age (rashayana);\n105. Boasting, abusive language, pronouncement of benediction, astrological prediction, buying and\nselling, ritual, debate on ritual, transgression of the Guru and scripture;\n106-107. Conciliating, fighting, vehicle, cot, white garment, release of semen, sleep by day time, vessel\nfor alms (alms-bowl), gold, gum-myrrh, weapon, seed (for cultivation or mystical letter forming the\nessential part of the mantra of a deity), injuring, severity, copulation, what is discarded by the yoga of\nrenunciation, vows such as the duties of house-holder;\n108. Family, etc., branch of the Veda (of his early days), all families of the father and mother, and\nwealth \u2013 all these are prohibited to the ascetic. If he resorts to them he falls (from the state of\nrenunciation).\n109. A wise man, though very old, shall not trust in women though very old. Even in very old patched\ngarments old cloth will stick (when stitched).\n110. Immovable property, mobile things (servants), seed (for cultivation), gold, gum-myrrh and weapon\nthese six an ascetic shall not take up as (though they were) urine and faeces.\n\n111. An ascetic shall not take with him even a little provision for a journey except when in danger; in\nhard times he may receive ripe corn when cooked food is not available.\n112. A mendicant monk who is not sick and a young monk shall not stay in any house (of a householder); he shall neither accept nor give anything to another at any time.\n113. With a sense of humility the ascetic shall strive for the welfare of beings; begging cooked or\nuncooked food (for another), he falls (from asceticism).\n114-115. An ascetic keen on feeding others, who accepts clothes, etc., and woollen garments or others\nas well as good clothes undoubtedly falls (from virtue). Resorting to the ship of non-duality he will\ngain liberation while living.\n116. For restraint in speech, he shall observe silence; for control over the body, he shall fast; for control\nover the mind, breath control (pranayama) is prescribed.\n117. A being is bound by (worldly) action; he gets liberated by spiritual knowledge. Hence far-seeing\nascetics do not perform (worldly) action.\n118. Scattered are (torn) garments on roads; alms can be had everywhere; the earth is a wide bed; how\n(then) are ascetics put to grief ?\n119. The ascetic who offers the whole world as oblation in the fire of spiritual wisdom, having\n(symbolically) transferred the ritual fires to his Self \u2013 that great ascetic is the (true) Agnihotrin (the\nconsecrator and maintainer of sacred fire).\n120. Advancement in the spiritual path is twofold \u2013 that of the she-cat and the she-monkey. Those who\npractise spiritual wisdom (Jnana) are (like) she-cats; the secondary way of (Apara-Brahman) is (like\nthat of) a she-monkey.\n121. The ascetic shall not speak to any one unless he is spoken to; nor to one who asks improperly. An\nintelligent man though knowing, should behave in the world as if he were dull-witted.\n122. When confronted with a mass of sins (i.e. when the flesh becomes weak, over-ruling the dictates\nof wisdom) he shall practise the (meaningful) repetition of the Taraka (Om) twelve thousand times (a\nday); for it cuts (sins).\n123. The supreme Brahman shines to him in twelve months who gently repeats the Pranava twelve\nthousand times every day. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm ! Let my limbs and speech, Prana, eyes, ears, vitality\nAnd all the senses grow in strength.\nAll existence is the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nMay I never deny Brahman, nor Brahman deny me.\nLet there be no denial at all:\nLet there be no denial at least from me.\nMay the virtues that are proclaimed in the Upanishads be in me,\nWho am devoted to the Atman; may they reside in me.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Sannyasopanishad, included in the Sama-Veda.",
    "Paramahamsaparivrajaka": "\nParamahamsa-Parivrajaka Upanishad\nTranslated by Prof. A. A. Ramanathan\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. Now then the god Brahma approaching his father Adinarayana, the supreme Being and paying\nobeisance asked of him: Lord, from your mouth all things pertaining to the nature of castes and orders\nhave been heard, known and grasped. Now I wish to know the characteristics of the Paramahamsa\nmendicant monk. Who is entitled to renunciation ? What are the characteristics of a mendicant monk ?\nWho is a Paramahamsa monk ? How is his mendicancy ? (Pray) expound to me all this. The Lord\nAdinarayana then replied:\n(The person entitled to renunciation) is the wise one who has undergone the difficult course of learning\nthe sacred lores from a good preceptor; has understood all the exertion necessary for happiness in this\nworld and the next; has understood the need to discard, as vomit, the three (primary) desires, the three\nprimary inclinations (regard for the body, etc.,), \u2018mine-ness\u2019 and egotism; has completed studentship in\ncelibacy which is the means to reach the path of liberation and has become a householder. From the\nstage of a householder he shall become a forest-dweller (Vanaprastha) and then renounce (worldly life).\nOr alternately he may renounce from the stage of a celibate student or from the stage of a house-holder\nor a forest-dweller. Or, whether or not he is an observer of vows, has completed his course of study, has\ndiscontinued his fire-ritual or does not maintain the sacred fire, he shall renounce that very day on\n\nwhich he has become disillusioned with the world. Thus discontented with all worldly affairs, whether\nas a celibate student, house-holder or forest-dweller, he shall get the approval of his father, mother,\nwife, close kinsmen and in the absence of these, of a disciple or fellow-lodger (and then renounce the\nworld).\n2. Some (law-givers) prescribe the sacrifice called Prajapatya (of which the god Brahma is the\npresiding deity, prior to a twice-born embracing renunciation). But (though thus prescribed) he may not\ndo so. He shall only perform the sacrifice Agneyi (whose presiding deity is Agni, the god of fire). For\nAgni is the vital breath (Prana). Thereby he does (i.e. strengthens) the vital breath. (Then) he shall\nperform the Traidhataviya sacrifice (whose presiding deity is the god Indra). By this (sacrifice) the\nthree vital fluids, namely the Sattva (semen), Rajas (blood) and Tamas (the dark one) (become strong\nlike fire). (Having performed the sacrifice in the prescribed manner he shall smell the holy fire, reciting\nthe following mantra):\n\u2018Oh Fire, this (vital breath) is your source; as you are born at the proper time (of the year) you put on\neffulgence. Knowing him (the Atman, your ultimate source) may you merge (with the Prana, your\nsource). May you increase our wealth (of transcendent knowledge)\u2019. So reciting the mantra he shall\nsmell the fire. This is the source of fire, the vital air. May you go to the Prana, may you go to your\nsource. Svaha. Thus alone the mantra says.\nHaving procured the holy fire from the house of a well-versed Vedic scholar he shall smell the holy fire\nin the manner described previously. If he is afflicted (by illness) or does not get the holy fire, he shall\noffer the oblation in the waters. For water is (presided over by) all the gods. Reciting, \u2018I offer the\noblation to all gods, Svaha\u2019, he shall tender the oblation and picking up (a small portion of) the offered\noblation which is mixed with ghee, he shall eat this, as it is beneficial. (In the case of the Kshatriyas\nand others not entitled to renunciation) the rule is that they may seek liberation) in the path of the brave\n(by courting death in battle-field) or fast (unto death as a discipline), or enter into water (to rise no\nmore) or enter fire or undertake the great journey (in which they collapse by exhaustion). If he were\nafflicted (by illness) he may renounce mentally or by speech (reciting mantras). This is the path (of\ntheir renunciation).\n3. A healthy person (if desiring to renounce the world) in the due order (of the stages in life) shall\nperform the shraddha ceremony unto himself and the fire-ritual for ridding himself of passions (Virajahoma). He shall infuse the ritual fire to be symbolically present in his person. His proficiency in the\naffairs of the world and Vedic learning as well as the fourteen means of action under his control\n(karanas) shall be transferred to his son (symbolically). In the absence (of a son) it shall be done to a\ndisciple; in his absence it shall be transferred into his Atman. He shall then meditate on Brahman as\nidentical with his Self, pronouncing the words \u2018Brahman Thou (Art)\u2019, \u2018The sacrifice thou (Art)\u2019. The\nVeda-mother, the prop of Brahmanhood and embodiment of the essence of all learning shall be\nconsigned into the waters reciting the three vyahritis (Om Bhuh, etc.,) and the three vyahritis into the\nletters a, u and m (of the Pranava). He shall then ceremoniously sip water keeping his attention on that\n(Pranava); pull out the tuft muttering the Pranava; snap the sacred thread; discard the garment too on\nthe ground or in the waters; become unclad reciting the mantra \u2018Om Bhuh Svaha, Om Bhuvah Svaha\nand Om Suvah Svaha\u2019; meditate on his own form; again recite mentally or in speech the Pranava and\nthe vyahritis separately and utter three times three the farewell words, \u2018I have renounced, I have\nrenounced, I have renounced\u2019 in gentle, middling and sharp tones; deeply engage in meditation on the\nPranava and raise his hand saying \u2018Freedom from fear to all from me, Svaha\u2019. He shall then start for the\nnorth thinking over the meaning of great scriptural texts such as \u2018The Brahman I Am\u2019, \u2018That Thou Art\u2019\nand proceed in the unclad state. This is renunciation.\nIf one is not entitled to this (way of renunciation), he shall recite first the prayer of the house-holder\nand then the texts \u2018Freedom from fear to all beings, every thing emanates from me, you are my friend\nand you guard me. You are the (source of) strength. You are the Vajra (weapon) of Indra which killed\n(the demon) Vritra. Be a blessing to me. Prevent that which is a sin\u2019. Reciting this mantra preceded by\n\nthe Pranava he shall take up the emblematic bamboo staff and water pot and wear the waist band, loincloth and a discoloured (i.e. ochre coloured) garment; then approach a good Guru, bow to him and\nreceive from the mouth of the Guru the great scriptural text 'That Thou Art', preceded by the Pranava.\nThen he shall wear a tattered garment or a bark-garment or a deer-skin; avoid a landing place at a river\nside (for bathing, to prevent mixing with crowds), moving up (a staircase), and getting alms from a\nsingle house. He shall bathe during the three prescribed periods, listen to an exposition of the Vedanta\nand practise the Pranava; be well established in the path of (realizing) Brahman; merge his favourite\ndesire in the Atman; become free of \u2018mine-ness\u2019 and get established in the Self; give up passion, anger,\ngreed, delusion, intoxication, rivalry, false pride, pride, egotism, intolerance, arrogance, desires, hatred,\ngloating, impetuosity, \u2018mine-ness\u2019, etc.; possessed of wisdom and dispassion he shall turn away from\nwealth and women and possessing a pure mind he shall ponder over the truths of all the Upanishads;\nguard bestowing particular care his celibacy, non-possession, universe-injuring attitude and\ntruthfulness; conquer his senses and be free from affection externally and internally; secure alms for\nsustaining the body, like a harmless cow, from members of the four castes excepting those who are\naccursed and fallen; such a person is considered worthy of realizing Brahman. He shall view with\nequanimity at gain or loss (of alms) at all times; eat food (secured as alms from many places) like a\nbee, using the hand as a vessel; not increase fat (but) become lean; feel that he is Brahman; approach a\nvillage for (serving the preceptor). He shall, steady in conduct, go about alone for eight months and\nshall not journey as two (i.e. with a companion).\nWhen he has attained sufficient good sense (i.e. dispassion) he may become a Kutichaka or a Bahudaka\nor a Hamsa or a Paramahamsa ascetic. Reciting the respective mantras he shall discard in the waters his\nwaist-band, loin-cloth, staff and water vessel and move about unclad. He shall stay one night in a\nvillage, three nights in a holy place, five nights in a town and seven nights in a place of pilgrimage\n(Kshetra). He shall be without a (fixed) abode, be steady in mind, not resort to a fire-place (for\nwarmth), be free from emotions, discard both rituals and non-rituals, receive alms for sustaining life\nalone with equanimity at its gain or loss in the manner of a cow, has his water vessel (only) in (the form\nof) a watering place and his residence in a solitary place free from trouble. He shall not think of gain or\nloss but be interested in rooting out both good and bad actions; sleep always on the floor; discard\nshaving, give up the restriction of observing chaturmasya, interest himself deeply in pure meditation,\nbe averse to wealth, women and city (life), behave like an insane person although perfectly sane,\npossess no distinguishing emblems or distinctive conduct, have no dreams as day and night are the\nsame to him and be attentive to the path of deep meditation on Brahman in the form of Pranava in\ninvestigating on the nature of the Self. He who thus gives up his body by resorting to renunciation is\nthe Paramahamsa mendicant monk.\n4. The god Brahma asked (Narayana): Lord, what is Brahma-Pranava ? (The Lord) Narayana replied:\nThe Brahma-Pranava consists of sixteen parts and it is cognized in quadruples in the four states\n(waking, etc.,). In the waking state there are the four states, waking within waking, etc., (jagrat-jagrat);\nin the dreaming state the four states are waking within dreaming, etc., (svapna-jagrat); in deep sleep\nthere are the four states waking within deep sleep, etc., (susupti-jagrat); in the fourth state (turiya) there\nare the four states waking within the Turiya, etc., (turiya-jagrat). In the waking state of distributive\npervasion (vyashti) there is quadruplicity of vishva, namely, vishva-vishva, vishva-taijasa, vishvaprajna and vishva-turiya. In the dreaming state of distributive pervasion there is quadruplicity of taijasa,\nnamely taijasa-vishva, taijasa-taijasa, taijasa-prajna and taijasa-turiya. In the state of deep sleep of\nPrajna there is quadruplicity, namely prajna-vishva, prajna-taijasa, prajna-prajna and prajna-turiya. In\nthe fourth state (turiya) there is the quadruplicity of the turiya, namely turiya-vishva, turiya-taijasa,\nturiya-prajna (and turiya-turiya). These in due order make up the sixteen parts. In the letter \u2018a\u2019 (of the\nOm \u2013 Aum) there is jagrat-vishva, in the letter \u2018u\u2019 jagrat-taijasa, in the letter \u2018m\u2019 jagrat-prajna, in the\nardha-matra (of Om) jagrat-turiya, in the bindu svapna-vishva, in the nada svapna-taijasa, in the kala\nsvapna-prajna, in the kalatita svapna-turiya, in the shanti susupta-vishva, in the shantyatita susupta-\n\ntaijasa, in pashyanti turiya-prajna, in para turiya-turiya. The four parts of jagrat pertain to the letter \u2018a\u2019,\nthe four parts of Svapna pertain to the letter \u2018u\u2019, the four parts of Susupti pertain to the letter \u2018m\u2019, the\nfour parts of turiya pertain to the ardha-matra. This is the Brahma-Pranava. This is to be worshipped by\nthe Paramahamsa, Turiyatita and Avadhuta ascetics. By this Brahman is illumined. (This is) liberation\nin the disembodied state (Videha-mukti).\n5. Lord, how is one without the sacred thread and tuft a person who has discarded all (worldly)\nactivities ? How is he solely devoted to absorption in Brahman ? How is he a Brahmana ? Thus the god\nBrahma asked (Narayana). Lord Vishnu then replied: Oh child, he who has knowledge of the non-dual\nAtman has the real sacred thread (i.e. that knowledge itself is the sacred thread). His deep absorption in\nmeditation is itself the tuft. This activity is (itself) the possession of the sanctifying ring of holy grass\n(pavitra). He does all actions, he is the Brahmana, he is deeply absorbed in Brahman, he is the\nillumined being (deva), he is the sage, he practises penance, he is the noblest, he is superior to all;\nknow that he is I. In this world very rare is the mendicant monk who is a Paramahamsa. If there is one\nhe is ever pure, he alone is the Purusha (glorified) in the Veda. He who is a great man (maha-purusha)\nhas his mind resting in me. I too remain in him alone. He is the ever-satisfied. He is free from the\n(effects of) cold and heat, happiness and misery, honour and dishonour. He puts up with insult and\nanger. He is devoid of the six human infirmities (hunger and thirst, sorrow and delusion, old age and\ndeath), and is free from the six properties (of the body, birth, existence, change, growth, decay and\ndeath). He is without the intervention of (i.e. he is not circumscribed by) the state of elderliness or\notherwise. Excepting the Self he sees nothing else. Unclad (lit. clothed by the points of the compass),\nbowing to none, not uttering Svaha (as he worships no gods), not uttering Svadha (to propitiate the\nmanes), without the need to send back (gods as they have not been invoked), free from blame and\npraise, not resorting to mantras and rituals, not meditating on other gods (than the supreme God),\nrefraining from aims and their absence, with all activities ceased, firmly established in Consciousness\nconsisting of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, being conscious of the one supreme bliss, he ever\nmeditates on the Brahma-Pranava (to the effect) that he is Brahman alone and thus fulfils himself; such\na one is the Paramahamsa mendicant monk. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Paramahamsa-Parivrajakopanishad, included in the Atharva-Veda.",
    "Akshamalika": "\nAksha Malika Upanishad\n[The Upanishad of Rosary Beads]\nTranslated by K. Srinivasan\nPublished by celextel.org\nOm ! May my speech be based on (i.e. accord with) the mind;\nMay my mind be based on speech.\nO Self-effulgent One, reveal Thyself to me.\nMay you both (speech and mind) be the carriers of the Veda to me.\nMay not all that I have heard depart from me.\nI shall join together (i.e. obliterate the difference of) day\nAnd night through this study.\nI shall utter what is verbally true;\nI shall utter what is mentally true.\nMay that (Brahman) protect me;\nMay That protect the speaker (i.e. the teacher), may That protect me;\nMay that protect the speaker \u2013 may That protect the speaker.\nOm !

Then the Prajap\u00e0ti (Creator) asked Guha: \u201cOh Sir, (please) tell me the rules regarding the rosary of\nbeads. What is its characteristic ? How many varieties of rosaries are there ? How many threads (does a\nrosary) contain ? How should it be made ? What are its colours ? How is it consecrated ? Who is its\npresiding deity ? And what is the benefit (of using it) ?\u201d\n2. Guha replied: \u201c(It is made of any one of the following 10 materials) Coral, Pearl, Crystal, Conch,\nSilver, Gold, Sandal, Putra-J\u00ecvik\u00e0, Lotus or Rudr\u00e0ksha. Each head must be devoted and thought of as\npresided over by the deities of Ak\u00e0ra to Kshak\u00e0ra. Golden thread should bind the beads through the\nholes. On its right silver (caps) and left copper. The face of a bead should face, the face of another head\nand tail, the tail. Thus a circular formation must be made.\n3. The internal thread must be thought of as Brahma (the Supreme Being). The right side silver cap\n\nmust be considered to be the place of Shiva and Copper caps belonging to Vishnu. The face must be\nthought of as Sarasvati and the tail as Gayatri. The hole is Knowledge. The knot must be thought of as\nnature. The Beads representing vowels must be white (since they represent S\u00e0ttvika Guna). Those\nwhich represent mutes-consonants must be yellowish (since they are the result of mixture of Sattva and\nTamas). The balance must be red in complexion (since they are R\u00e0jasic).\n4. Then (after thus meditating the presiding deities in different part of the rosary) bathe it (or clean it) in\nthe milk got from 5 types of cows (like Nanda); and then in Pancha-gavya (a sanctified liquid prepared\nfrom the cow-dung, cow\u2019s urine, ghee, curd and milk) and darbha grass immersed in water and then in\nthe individual Pancha-gavya (in the aforesaid 5 things separately) and in sandal water. Then sprinkle\nwater with darbha grass uttering Omk\u00e0ra. Besmear it with eight fragrant (pastes) of eight (sweetsmelling substances like Sandal, Kasturi etc.,). Place it on flowers. Meditate (all) the letters in the\nrosary (or each letter in each bead).\n5. Om A\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the conqueror of death, Omnipresent, be established in the 1st head !\nOm \u00c0\u00ebk\u00e0ra, He who of the nature of attracting, found everywhere, be established in the 2nd head !\nOm I\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the giver of wealth and firmness, be established in the 3rd head !\nOm \u00cc\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the maker of clarity in speech and clear One, be established in the 4th head!\nOm U\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the giver of strength, the essence of everything, be established in the 5th head!\nOm \u00d9\u00ebk\u00e0ra, One who drives away evil spirits, the intolerable, be established in the 6th head !\nOm \u00c4\u00ebk\u00e0ra, One who disturbs the (the dis-order), the moving One, be established in the 7th head !\nOm \u00cd\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the deluding one, the effulgent and shining, be established in the 8th head !\nOm \u00ce\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the hater, the devourer of everything else (or one who conceals everything), be established\nin the 9th head !\nOm \u00ce\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the deluding one, be established in the 10th head !\nOm E\u00ebk\u00e0ra, One who attracts everyone, Suddha-sattva, be established in the 11th head!\nOm Ai\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the Pure and Noble (Suddha-sattvika), attracting human beings, be established in the 12th\nhead !\nOm O\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the (base) of entire speech, eternally pure, be established in the 13th head !\nOm Au\u00ebk\u00e0ra, of the nature of speech, capable of attracting the peaceful, be established in the 14th\nhead !\nOm A\u00ebk\u00e0ra, capable of attracting elephants etc., attracting, be established in the 15th head!\nOm A\u00e3k\u00e0ra, capable of destroying death terrible, be established in the 16th head !\nOm Ka\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the remover of all poison, giver of auspiciousness, be established in the 17th head !\nOm Kha\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the tormentor (or disturber) spreading everywhere, be established in the 18th head !\nOm Ga\u00ebk\u00e0ra, He who puts dows all obstacles, the greatest, be established in the 19th head !\nOm Gha\u00ebk\u00e0ra, the giver of \u2026\u2026\u2026.

Then one must say: \u201cSalutations to seven crore mantras and 64 arts\u201d and invoke their powers in\nrosary.\n10. Then one must say: \u201cSalutations to Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva\u201d and invoke their powers in rosary.\n11. Then one must say: \u201cSalutations unto the 36 Tattvas (the fundamental categories)\u201d and invoke the\npresence of the best Tattvas in it, praying to them to make the rosary capable of yielding the desired\nfruit like a divine-cow (Kamadhenu).\n12. Then one must say: \u201cSalutations unto Hundreds of Thousands of Saivites, Vaishnavites and Saktas\n(and seek their blessings and permission to use the rosary); be pleased and permit me to use\u201d.\n13. Then one must say: \u201cSalutations unto the powers of Mrityu; Let you all make me happy, happy !\u201d\n14. Then meditating on the rosary as representing everything as the form of God, should start touching\neastwards, feeling grateful to its help and touch the heads (beads) 108 times.\n15. Then getting up, placing it (on flowers) circumambulating utter the following incantation: \u201cOm, Oh\ngoddess, salutations, mother of all mantras of the forms of letters, rosary of beads; He who attracts\n\neveryone, Salutations ! Oh goddess mantra matrike, rosary of beads, stupefier of everything,\nSalutations ! Oh goddess, the remover of Abhicharas, Salutations ! Oh goddess, eternal One, conqueror\nof nescience, the illuminator of everything, protector of the all world, life giver for all world, creator of\neverything, ordainer of the day, ordainer of the night, mover to the other rivers, mover to other places,\nmover to other islands, mover to other worlds, shining everywhere always, she who illumines all hearts\n!\nSalutations to you of the form of Par\u00e0 !\nSalutations to you of the form of Pa\u00e9yanti !\nSalutations to you of the form of Madhyam\u00e0 !\nSalutations to you of the form of Vaikhari !\nSalutations ! Salutations to you of the nature of all Tattvas, all knowledge, of the nature of all powers,\nof the nature of all good, worshipped by sage Vasistha, attended to by sage Visvamitra !\n16. If one studies this in morning, the sins of night are destroyed. If one studies this in evening twilight,\nsins done in day are destroyed. One who reads this both in the morning and evening, even if a sinner,\nbecomes rid off sins. The mantras recited with rosary immediately gives benefits.\u201d Thus said Guha to\nPrajapati. Thus ends the Upanishad.\nOm!

May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. Thou art the one Imperishable in the Imperishable, conjoint with Uma. As known by means of\nSusumna, here (on the empirical plane), the one firm (Principle art Thou). Thou art the ancient source\nof the world, the Lord of beings; Thou the Parjanya (the Principle of life-giving water), the Protector of\nthe world.\n2. Thou art immanent in all; from (the view-point) of the wise, Thou, the Lord of the world art the allknowing (Fire). In the beginning Thou art unborn, the first born, the sacrifice, too, art Thou. Thou alone\nthe one omnipresent and ancient.\n3. Thou art the Principle of life; Thou the manifestation (the manifested world); Thou the source of the\nworld; by a quarter hast Thou pervaded this world. Thou art the world\u2019s birth, the cause, the life\nsupreme, and the child in the womb armed with the excellent bow and arrow.\n4. Having widely spread out the arrow, shining like the youthful sun in the sky, Thou shinest as\nHiranyagarbha. By means of light hast Thou created the resplendent eagle (the sun), in the sky. Thou\nart Subrahmanya, Thou Arishtanemi (a brother of Garuda).\n5. Thou art the bearer of the Thunderbolt (Indra), the Lord of beings; Thou alone art love in all living\nbeings and in Soma (Shiva with Uma). Thou art the sacred syllables Svaha, Svadha and Vasat; Thou the\nRudra immanent unhurt in the hearts of beasts.\n6. (Thou art) the supporter, the ordainer, the purifier (air), the all pervading plenum, the divine Varaha,\nnight and aloneness; the past, the future and the present; Thou art all activities, time, sequence and the\nsupreme Imperishable.\n\n7. The Vedic verses, prose formulas and songs proceed from Thy mouth. Thou shinest best (as) the\nVasus and the sky. Thou art the leader of the sacrifice, the all-pervading fire and the Rudras. So also\n(art Thou) the hosts of demons and Vasus.\n8. This God here dwells in the sun (the wheel of the celestial chariot) and elsewhere dispelling\ndarkness. All that pertains to Him shines in lovely (fashion) like gold in some other sky. (This world of\nrelativities shines so).\n9. He is the all-knower; the Protector of the world; the firm nave of all born beings. He exists\nlengthwise and crosswise, the sum total of (things) spread out in order. He is the birthless (of wondrous\nbirths) Prajapati sung in the Vedas.\n10. Thou art He whom in the sacrifices the knowers of Brahman adore with Vedic Songs, formulas and\nrites and the soma juice; as the final (Truth) devoid of all admixture, as the golden, the best of Vedaknowers.\n11. Thou alone art the woman, the man; again Thou art the boy and the girl. Thou art the ordainer, the\nKing Varuna, the Year, Aryama, the all.\n12. (Thou art) Mitra, the bright-feathered (Garuda), the moon, Indra, Varuna, Rudra, Tvastar, Vishnu,\nSavitar, the lord of light, Thou Vishnu protectest all beings from the demoniac; the world is\nencompassed by Thee; Thou the womb of all that is born; Thou art the earth, the atmosphere, the\nfirmament; Thou art the self-born; Thou art turned towards all.\n13. Whoso thus knows the eternal Dweller in the cave (of the heart), the ancient Lord who has become\nthe all, the golden, the supreme goal of the wise, is wise. He stays transcending all (forms of) wisdom.\nThis is the secret doctrine.\nOm !

    "Annapurna": "\nAnnapurna Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nI-1-2. The king of Yogins, Nidagha, prostrated flat (like a rod) before Ribhu, that pre-eminent knower\nof Brahman. Then, rising, that ascetic respectfully said, \u2018Teach me the truth about the Self; by what\nkind of adoration have you, Oh Brahmana, attained this state ?\nI-3-4. Teach me that grand science which yields sovereignty over the empire of emancipation. \u2018You\nhave done well, Nidagha ! Listen to the eternal science by the knowledge of which alone will you be\nliberated life. Lodged in Om that envelopes the Root of phenomena (Brahman), supporting the syllable\n\u2018aim\u2019,\nI-5-7. \u2018Eternal bliss, independent (\u2018hrim\u2019), renowned, with streaming stresses (\u2018sauh\u2019), the ruler of the\nworld (\u2018srim\u2019), Mahalakshmi, (at once) desire (\u2018klim\u2019), fulfilment, and humanity, is the divine\nAnnapurna. \u2018I begged of Her, using the celebrated and quintessential incantation of 27 syllables,\ncultivated by hosts of female ascetics,\nI-8. \u2018Namely, aim, hrim, sauh, srim, klim, aum namo bhagavatyannapurne mamabhilashitam annam\ndehi Svaha. [Salutation, O divine Annapurna, vouchsafe the food I desire]: \u2018Thus have I been instructed\nby my father. From then on have I established myself in (this) discipline, persisting in the activities of\nmy station (in life) and have given myself up to the daily practice of this incantation.\n\nI-9. \u2018When many days passed thus, there appeared in front of me Annapurna, wide-eyed, her lotus-face\nbeaming with a smile.\nI-10. \u2018Seeing her, I prostrated flat on the ground, and (then) stood up with folded hands. \u201cWell, child,\nyou have done well; ask of me a boon, delay not.\u201d\nI-11. Oh (Nidagha), best of sages ! Thus hidden by the wide-eyed (deity) I spoke: \u2018O Daughter of the\nmountain, may the truth of the Self dawn on my mind\u2019.\nI-12. Saying \u2018be it so\u2019 she vanished, then and there. Then, through the perception of the world\u2019s variety\nthe idea (mati) arose in me.\nI-13. Delusion appears five-fold; it will be presently set forth. Due to the first delusion, Jiva and God\nappear to have different forms.\nI-14. Due to the second, the attribute of agency dwelling in the Self appears to be real. The third\n(consists in) deeming the Jiva associated with the three bodies as having attachment.\nI-15. The fourth takes the world-cause (God) to be mutable. The fifth delusion ascribes reality to the\nworld as distinguished from its cause. Then, also, in the mind flashes the cessation of the five-fold\ndelusion.\nI-16. From that moment, spontaneously, my mind was assimilated to Brahman. O Nidagha, thus may\nyou, too, secure knowledge of reality.\nI-17. With humility and respect (Nidagha spoke to Ribhu: impart to me, having faith (in you), the\npeerless science of Brahman.\nI-18. Gratified, Ribhu said: \u2018so be it\u2019. I shall impart to you the knowledge of reality, O sinless one. Be a\nmighty agent, ardent enjoyer, and a great renouncer. Having this investigated your own real nature, be\nhappy.\nI-19. \u2018I am Brahman, ever manifest, pure, first, endless; there is no room for the slightest dallying with\naught else\u2019 \u2013 thus think, having become blemishless; achieve Nirvana (permanent peace) having\npurified and quietened all movements of the mind.\nI-20. Know that none of the things seen here is there; it is all like \u2018the city in the sky\u2019 and \u2018water in the\ndesert\u2019.\nI-21. On the other hand, what is nowhere seen, at all, is not given (as an object); beyond the range of\nthe sixth sense, mind, O sage -- assimilate yourself to That.\nI-22. Grasp: I am That which is the indestructible, infinite, Spirit, the Self of everything, integral,\nreplete, abundant and partless.\nI-23. Due to the absolute contemplation of absence (or nihil), when the mind dwindles, there results the\nstate of the being-in-general (satta-samanya), of that whose essence is unqualified consciousness.\nI-24. Surely, devoid of all objective tinge, when consciousness (chit) subsides, there supervenes the\nexceedingly transparent being-in-general that resembles non-being.\nI-25. For the liberated Self, both embodied and disembodied, surely there occurs this ultimate\nperception known as the state-beyond-the fourth.\nI-26. O sinless one, this occurs in the case of the knower both when he has risen from Concentration\n(Samadhi) and when he is established in it; being born of awareness, this does not happen for the\nignorant alone.\nI-27. All waverings between states of reasoning, etc., having vanished long since, his face steeped in\nthe lovely light of Brahmic bliss, (the sage) attains the blessed state through right knowledge alone.\nI-28. The inner cool (calm repose) of him who perceives this multitude of gunas as non-Self is said to\nbe Concentration.\nI-29. The steady mind is empty of latent impulses; the same is (the state of) contemplation. The same\nalso is Aloneness. Besides, it is nothing but perpetual quiescence.\nI-30. The mind with attenuated latent impulses is said to be bound for the highest state. Next, the mind,\nwithout such impulses, attains the status of the non-doer.\nI-31. On the other hand, the mind\u2019s imagination of being the doer is replete with latent impulses; it\n\ncauses all sufferings; therefore attenuated latent impulses.\nI-32. When the imagination of unity with all objects is mentally discarded, due to its constant\nintroverted state, all things are resolved into empty space.\nI-33. As crowds in a market, though active, are as good as non-existent (to the observer) when he is not\nrelated (to them), so too, to the knower is a village like unto a forest.\nI-34. Being inwardly withdrawn, the knower, either asleep, awake, walking or reading, beholds a city,\ncountry-side, or village as if it were no other than a forest (i.e. with total disinterestedness).\nI-35. Once the inner cool is won, the world is cool. To those scorched by the inner thirst, the world is\nafire.\nI-36. For all (unliberated) beings what is within is projected externally.\nI-37. But the lover of the inner Self, though operating through the organs of action, is unaffected by joy\nand sorrow; he is said to be concentrated.\nI-38. He who, as a matter of course and not through fear, beholds all beings as one\u2019s own Self and\nothers\u2019 possessions as clods of earth, alone sees aright.\nI-39. Let death come now or at the end of cycles; he remains unblemished as gold (fallen) in mire.\nI-40. Consider in your mind: who am I ? How is all this (brought about) ? How do death and birth\n(happen) ? Thus (considering) will you earn the great benefit (of investigation).\nI-41. Your mind will shed its (discursive) form and quietly win repose, once, through investigation, you\ncomprehend your real nature.\nI-42. O Brahmin, your mind, cured of its feverishness, no more sinks in empirical activities, as an\nelephant does not, in the hollow made by a cow\u2019s hoof.\nI-43. But a petty mind, O Brahmin, does sink in any petty affair, just as a battered mosquito does, in the\nwater collected in the hollow made by a cow\u2019s hoof.\nI-44. O best of ascetics, to the extent all objects are readily renounced, the supreme Self, the\ntranscendent light, alone remains.\nI-45. So long as all objects are not renounced, the Self is not won. What remains after the renunciation\nof the entire objective manifold is said to be the Self.\nI-46. Therefore, in order to realize the Self, renounce everything. Having cast off all (objects),\nassimilate yourself to that which remains.\nI-47. Whatever object is beheld in the world around is but the vibration of Consciousness, it is nothing\npermanent.\nI-48. O Brahmin, by the term Samadhi (Concentration) the wise denote transcendent understanding that\nis concentrated, eternally appeased, and is cognisant of things as they are.\nI-49. The term Concentration denotes the stable, mountain-like, status (of the self) that is unagitated,\nunegoistic, and unrelated to dualities.\nI-50. O Brahmin, it denotes the perfected flow of the mind that is sure, choiceless and goalless.\nI-51. The best of the knowers of the Vedas, the great ones, win that fourth and stable perception that is\nfashioned solely through a part of the light of the Spirit.\nI-52. (It is) lodged in the heart of all things and not altogether unlike dreamless slumber, when the mind\nand the ego subside.\nI-53. After liquidating the mind with the mind, that state \u2013 that supremely divine bliss-body \u2013 is\nautomatically won.\nI-54. Thence follows the obliteration of all cravings for objects; then dawns the auspicious and superbly\nsplendid light, and then, in the case of the very best, due to the sway of even-mindness (takes place) the\nineffable transformation into the Self\u2019s substance.\nI-55. Directly experienced indeed as the God of gods and Self of all entities, moving and stationary is\nthis total and infinite reality of the Self, dwelling in the fast-evolving mind that is quietened externally.\nI-56. The unattached, steady, and controlled mind is not in evidence in the worldings; the attached\nmind, though subjected to long-drawn austerities is, as it were, altogether bound.\n\nI-57. The man free from inner clingings, whose mind dwells on the blissful (Brahman) may or may not\nact externally; never can he be either agent or experiencer.\nII-1. Nidagha: What is attachment like ? What kind of it leads to human bondage ? And what kind of it\nis said to liberate ? How is this (attachment) cured ?\nII-2. (Ribhu): Imagination, ignoring wholly the distinction between the body and the embodied (Self) \u2013\nthe exclusive faith in the body \u2013 is the attachment that is said to bind.\nII-3. All this is Self: what shall I seek here and what avoid ? Know this to be the position of nonattachment that the Jivanmukta fosters.\nII-4. I am not; none, other than me, is; neither this nor the non-other exists. This (attitude) is said to be\nnon-attachment, always maintaining, \u2018I am Brahman\u2019.\nII-5. He does not approve of inactivity; neither does he cling to activities. He, the renouncer, is the\nsuperbly equable (in outlook); he is said to be the non-attached.\nII-6. One who mentally, and not in the concrete act alone, renounces fruits, etc., of all his activities \u2013\nthat adept is said to be non-attached.\nII-7. Imaginations and the manifold activities issuing (therefrom) are cured, here, by non-indulgence in\nimagination; thus promote well-being.\nII-8-9. The mind that clings not to acts, thoughts, and things, to wanderings and reckonings of time, but\nreposes in Consciousness alone, finding no delight anywhere, even when turned toward some objects,\nrevels in the Self.\nII-10. Let him perform or not all this empirical activity; doing or non-doing, his true occupation is Selfdelight.\nII-11. Or, giving up even that objective element, as stabilised Consciousness, the tranquillised Jiva\nabides in the Self like a radiant gem.\nII-12. The quiescent state of the attenuated mind, free from all objective reference, is said to be the\ndeep sleep in wakefulness.\nII-13. This state of slumber, O Nidagha, fully developed through practice, is styled the Fourth by the\nbest knowers of Truth.\nII-14. Having attained the indestructible status in this fourth stage, one reaches a non-blissful poise (as\nit were), its nature being invariably delightful.\nII-15. Thence lifted above all relativities, like non-bliss and great bliss, the time-less Yogin, reaching\nthe state beyond the fourth, is said to be liberated.\nII-16. With all bonds of birth loosened, and all Tamasic conceits dissolved, the great sage (abides) as\nthe blissful being of the supreme Self like a salt-crystal in water.\nII-17. That which is the trans-empirical and experiential reality, present in the (contrasted) perceptions\nof the material and the conscious, is the essence; Brahman is said to be that.\nII-18(a). Bondage is encompassed by the object; on release from this, liberation is said to supervene.\nII-18(b)-19. Resting in that unvexed experience, discriminated in the link between the substance and\nperception, abide you; thus one attains the (peace) of deep sleep. That develops into the Fourth; station\nyour gaze on That.\nII-20. The Self is neither gross nor subtle; neither manifest nor hidden; neither spiritual nor material;\nneither non-being nor being.\nII-21. That non-dual indestructible one which has become the object, the ground of mind and all senseorgans, is neither \u2018I\u2019 nor another; neither one nor many.\nII-22. That real joy (experienced) in the relation between the object and perception is the transcendental\nstate; therefore it is, as it were, nothing (in itself).\nII-23. Liberation is not on the top of the sky; not in the nether world; not on the earth. The dwindling of\nmind in which all desires dry up is held to be liberation.\nII-24. With the thought, within, \u2018let me have liberation\u2019 the mind springs up; this worldly bondage is\n\nfirm in the mind agitated with thought.\nII-25. The mere non-cleansing of the mind reduces it to a state of prodigious transmigration; its\ncleansing alone, on the other hand, is said to be liberation.\nII-26. What is bondage and what is liberation in respect of the Self that transcends all things or that\npervades all forms ? Think freely.\nII-27. Loving the Spirit, lifted above all hopes, full, holy in mind, having won the incomparable state of\nrepose, he seeks nothing here.\nII-28. He is called the Jivanmukta (Liberated in life) who lives, unattached, in the pure Being that\nsustains all, the indubitable Spirit that is the Self.\nII-29. He craves not for what is yet to be; he does not bank on the present; he remembers not the past;\nyet he does all work.\nII-30. Ever unattached to those who cling to him; devoted to the devotees; he is harsh, as it were, to the\nharsh.\nII-31. A child amidst children; adult amidst adults; bold amidst the bold; a youth amidst the youthful;\nlamenting amidst those who lament;\nII-32. Steadfast, blissful, polished, of holy speech, wise, simple and sweet; never given to self-pity;\nII-33. Through discipline, when the throb of vital breaths ceases, the mind is wholly dissolved; the\nimpersonal bliss (Nirvana) remains;\nII-34. Whence all discursive speech turns back. With the obliteration of all of one\u2019s mental\nconstructions that (Brahmic) status abides.\nII-35. Here is the supreme Self whose essence is the light of Consciousness without beginning or end;\nthe wise hold this luminous certitude to be the right knowledge.\nII-36. The plenitude due to the knowledge \u2018all the world is Self alone\u2019 is the right measure of Selfrealization everywhere in the world.\nII-37. All is Self alone; what are the (empirical) states being and non-being ? Where have they fled ?\nWhere are those notions of bondage and liberation ? What stands out is Brahman alone.\nII-38. All is the one supreme Sky. What is liberation ? What is bondage ? This is the great Brahman,\nestablished mightily, with extended form; duality has vanished far from It; be you, yourself, the Self\nalone.\nII-39. When the form of a stock, stone and cloth is seen aright, there is not even a shadow of difference;\nbent on imagination (of differences) where are you ?\nII-40. This imperishable and tranquil essence, (present) at the beginning and end of things and yourself,\nalways be That.\nII-41. With mental distinctions of duality and non-duality and delusions of old age and death, the Self\nalone shines in its phases (atmabhih) just as the sea, in its (phases of) waves.\nII-42. What enjoyment of the desired (fruits) can disturb him, who dwells steadfast, ever wedded, in\nthought, to the pure Self that fells the tree of dangers, to the status of bliss supreme ?\nII-43. Mental enjoyments are the foes of one who has thought extensively; they move him not in the\nleast just as gentle breezes move not a hill at all.\nII-44. \u2018Plurality exists in diverse imaginings, not really, within; just as there is nothing but water in a\nlake\u2019 \u2013 a man filled with this one certitude is said to be liberated; he who has perceived the Real.\nIII-1. (Nidagha): What is the nature of liberation without the body ? Who is the great sage in possession\nof it ? Resorting to which Yoga has he achieved that supreme status ?\nIII-2. Ribhu: In the region of Sumeru the celebrated sage Mandavya resorting to Truth (imparted by)\nKaundinya became liberated in life.\nIII-3. Having attained the status of Jivanmukti, that foremost knower of Brahman, that great sage, made\nup his mind, once upon a time, to withdraw all his sense-organs (from their respective objects).\nIII-4. He sat in the lotus-posture, with eyes half-closed, slowly avoiding contacts (with objects),\n\nexternal and internal.\nIII-5. Then he, with his sinless mind, (reflected on) the (degree of) steadiness of his mind: \u2018clearly,\nthough withdrawn, this mind of mine is extremely restless\u2019.\nIII-6. It wanders from a cloth to a pot and thence to a big cart. The mind wanders among objects as a\nmonkey does from tree to tree.\nIII-7. The five openings, eyes and so forth, known as the sense organs of cognition, I am watching\ncarefully with my mind.\nIII-8. O you sense-organs ! Slowly give up your mood of agitation. Here I am, the divine spiritual Self,\nthe witness of all.\nIII-9. With that all-knowing Self, I have comprehended (the nature of) eyes, etc. I am\ncompletely secure and at peace. Luckily I am fearless.\nIII-10. Incessantly I rest in my Self, the Fourth; my vital breaths, its extensions, have all, in due order,\nsubsided within.\nIII-11. (I am) as a fire with its multitudinous flames, when the fuel has been consumed; it blazed forth\nbut now is extinguished \u2013 the blazing fire has, indeed, been extinguished.\nIII-12. Having been purified utterly, I remain equable, enjoying all alike, as it were. I am awake though\nin deep sleep; though in deep sleep, I am awake.\nIII-13-14. Resorting to the Fourth, I remain within the body with a stable status, having abandoned,\ntogether with the long thread of sound reaching upto OM, objects in all the three worlds fashioned by\nimagination.\nIII-15. As a bird, for flying in the sky, leaves the net (in which it was enmeshed), the great sage sheds\n(his) identification with the sense-organs; then (he sheds) his awareness of limbs which has become\nillusory.\nIII-16. He has won the knowledge of a new-born infant; as if the air should give up its power to vibrate,\nhe has terminated the proneness of consciousness to attach itself to objects.\nIII-17. Then, attaining the unqualified state of Consciousness \u2013 the state of pure Being \u2013resorting, (as it\nwere), to the state of dreamless slumber, he has stayed immovable like a mountain.\nIII-18. Winning the stability of dreamless sleep he has attained the Fourth; though gone beyond bliss,\n(he is) still blissful; he has become both being and non-being.\nIII-19. Then he becomes that which is beyond even the range of words which is the nihil of the nihilist\nand Brahman of the knowers of Brahman;\nIII-20. Which is the pure blemishless cognition of the knowers of cognition, the Purusha of the\nSankhyas and Ishvara of the Yogins;\nIII-21. The Shiva of the Shivagamas; the Time of those who affirm Time alone (as the basic principle);\nthe final doctrine of all Shastras, and what conforms to every heart;\nIII-22. Which is the All, the all-pervading Reality, the Truth. He has become That, the unuttered, the\nmoveless, the illuminator even of lights;\nIII-23. The Principle whose sole proof is one\u2019s experience of It \u2013 he has remained as That.\nIII-24. That which is unborn, deathless, beginningless and the First immaculate state, whole and\nimpartite \u2013 he has remained as That; a state subtler than that of the sky. In a moment, he has become the\nhallowed God.\nIV-1. Has the Jivanmukta characteristics like the power to fly in space, etc., ? If so, great sage, it is not\npresent in the perfected man (described above).\nIV-2. O Brahmin, a non-knower of the Self, still in bondage, achieves (the powers) to fly in space, etc.,\nby virtue of (specific) substances, incantations, practices and potencies of time.\nIV-3. This is not the concern of the Self-knower. One having contentment in one\u2019s Self never hankers\nafter (the phenomena of) nescience.\nIV-4. Whatever objects are present in the world are (held to be) of the stuff of nescience. How can the\n\ngreat Yogin, who has dispelled nescience, plunge into them ?\nIV-5. Whichever confounded person or man of little understanding desires the group of Yogic powers\nachieves them, one by one, through set practices, instrumental to them.\nIV-6. Substances, incantations, actions applied at (the right) time, yield Yogic powers all right. None of\nthem lifts man to the status of God.\nIV-7. Only influenced by some desire does man work for miraculous powers. The perfect man, seeking\nnothing, can have no desire whatsoever.\nIV-8. When all desires dry up, O sage, the Self is won. How can the mindless (sage) desire miraculous\npowers ?\nIV-9. The man liberated in life would feel no surprise were the sun to radiate cool light, the moon\nscorching rays or the fire to blaze downwards.\nIV-10. (The whole world) is superimposed on the supreme Reality, the Ground, as the snake is on the\nrope. No curiosity is aroused as regards these superimposed wonders.\nIV-11. Those indeed who have known what is to be known and shed all attachments, whose intellect is\ngreat, the knots of whose hearts have been cut, are free, though living in the body.\nIV-12. Dead is his mind who is unmoved in joy and sorrow, and whom nothing jerks out of equality,\neven as breaths stir not a mighty mountain.\nIV-13. Dead is the mind of one who is undisturbed by danger, resourcelessness, energy, hilarity,\ndullness, or great rejoicing.\nIV-14. The destruction of mind is twofold, determinate and indeterminate. In (the state of) liberation in\nlife it is determinate; in that of disembodied liberation it is indeterminate.\nIV-15. The presence of mind makes for sorrow; its destruction promotes joy. Attenuate the existent\nmind and bring about its destruction.\nIV-16. The nature of mind, know, is folly, O sinless one ! When that perishes one\u2019s real essence,\nmindlessness, is (won).\nIV-17. The mind of one liberated in life, having qualities like friendliness, etc., is rich in noble\nimpulses; it is never reborn.\nIV-18. This \u2018destruction\u2019 of the Jivanmukta\u2019s mind is determinate; Nidagha, with disembodied\nliberation comes indeterminate destruction.\nIV-19. One liberated in disembodiment is he who realizes the partless Self; his mind, the abode of all\nexcellent qualities as it was, is dissolved.\nIV-20-21. In that supremely holy, blemishless status of disembodied liberation, marked by\n\u2018mindlessness\u2019, in that state of indeterminate destruction of the mind, just nothing remains, neither\nqualities nor their absence; neither glory nor its absence; nothing (whatsoever) of the world;\nIV-22. Neither sunrise nor sunset; neither sensations of joy or anger; neither light nor darkness; neither\ntwilight, day nor night; neither being, non-being, nor centrality marks the status (of disembodied\nliberation).\nIV-23. The spacious status of those (who are liberated in disembodiment), who have gone beyond\nintellect and the pomp of worldly life, is like the sky, the abode of the winds.\nIV-24. The great (Jivanmuktas) whose bodies are the subtle ether become disembodied there (in the\nstate of disembodied liberation); all their sufferings are cured; they are immaterial; totally quiescent,\nimmobilized in bliss, beyond Rajas and Tamas. In that state dissolve the remnants of their mind.\nIV-25. O great sage, Nidagha, rid your mind of all latent tendencies; concentrate your mind forcefully,\nand go beyond all mental constructions.\nIV-26. That eternally self-shining Light, illuminating the world, is alone the witness of this world, the\nSelf of all, the pure One.\nIV-27. As massed Intelligence It is the ground of all beings. That non-dual Brahman characterised by\ntruth, knowledge, and bliss is the object of knowledge.\nIV-28-29. The sage fulfils his duty with the realization, \u2018I am the one Brahman\u2019; (Brahman is) the\n\nground of all, non-dual, supreme, eternal, of the essence of being, intelligence, and bliss, beyond the\nrange of word and mind.\nIV-30. There shine not the forms of the moon and the sun; the winds blow not; and none of the gods\n(are there). This divinity alone shines forth as being, pure by itself, free from rajas.\nIV-31. The knot of the heart is split; all doubts are cut asunder. All his actions dwindle when He, who is\nboth here and beyond, is seen.\nIV-32. In this body are the birds, called the Jiva and the Lord, dwelling together. Of them the Jiva eats\nthe fruit of action, not the great Lord.\nIV-33. Alone as the Witness, without participation, the great Lord shines by Himself. Through Maya is\nset up the difference between them. Spirit is other than Its form; as It does not dwindle, the Spirit is\nnon-different (from all objects).\nIV-34. As the unity of the Spirit is established through reasoning and means of right knowledge, once\nthat unity is comprehensively known, one no more sorrows; nor is one deluded.\nIV-35. Having the certain knowledge, \u2018I am the ground of the whole world, solid Truth and\nKnowledge\u2019, the sage may dispel (all) sorrow.\nIV-36. Those whose flaws have (all) been attenuated realize in their own bodies the Witness of all,\nwhose essence is self-luminous Being; not those others who are encompassed by Maya.\nIV-37. Knowing Him alone, let the intelligent Brahmana build up wisdom; let him not dwell on a\nmultitude of words that only makes for verbal weariness.\nIV-38. Having mastered the knowledge of Brahman let him live in childlikeness alone. Having\nmastered both Brahman-knowledge and childlikeness, the sage possesses the Self.\nIV-39. Know the elemental body as the seed of the creeper of samsara (the transmigratory life) with its\nimmense sprouts, good and evil, having their potencies latent (in the body).\nIV-40. Of this body, the seed is the mind conforming to cravings; it is a sheath of active and quiescent\nmoods, a casket holding the gem of pain.\nIV-41. The tree of the mind has two seeds; one is the vibration of the vital breath; the other, obstinate\nimagination.\nIV-42. When the vital breath, aroused by nervous contacts, vibrates, at once the mind is transformed\ninto a mass of sensations.\nIV-43. That all-pervading awareness is aroused by the vibration of the vital breath. It is better to\nsuppress the awareness (of objects); less harmful is the vibration of the vital breath, etc.\nIV-44. For mental peace, the Yogins suppress vital breaths through breath-control, meditation and\npractices dictated by reasoning.\nIV-45. Know the supreme cause yielding the fruit of mental peace: (namely) the joyful Self-abidance of\ncognition that is known as breath-control.\nIV-46. Latent impression is said to consist in the seizing of an object (by the force of) entrenched\nimagination, despite all considerations of cause and effect.\nIV-47. Rejecting everything and imagining nothing, either to be chosen or rejected, the mind remains\n(in itself); now is the mind unborn.\nIV-48. Being continuously free from latent impressions, when the mind ceases to ponder there arises\nmindlessness that yields supreme tranquillity.\nIV-49. When no aspect of objects in the world is imagined how can the mind be born in the empty sky\nof the heart ?\nIV-50. The conception of a thing\u2019s absence is based on its non-being; mindlessness is posited with\nreference to the object-as-such.\nIV-51. The mind abiding coolly in itself, after the inner rejection (of all objects), though in\nmodifications, is (still) held to have the form of non-being.\nIV-52. They indeed are deemed liberated in life whose latent, unenjoyed, impressions are like the fried\nseeds, incapable of sprouting any more.\n\nIV-53. Their minds have acquired the form of Sattva; they have gone beyond the farther shore of\nknowledge; they are said to be mindless. With the fall of their bodies they become sky-like.\nIV-54. Due to rejection of objects, both the vibrations of vital breaths and latent impressions swiftly\nperish as does a tree whose root is cut off.\nIV-55. In this state of cognition, whatever appears either as experienced before or as altogether new,\nmust be meticulously wiped out by every one whose knowledge is sound.\nIV-56. The vast transmigratory life is (due to) the failure to obliterate them; on the contrary, liberation\nis held to be just their obliteration.\nIV-57. Be immaterial (spiritual), rejecting all pleasures and cognitions.\nIV-58. Knowledge depends on the states of objects; one having no knowledge is non-cognitive, though\nhe performs a hundred actions; he is held to be non-inert.\nIV-59. He is said to be liberated in life, the clear sphere of whose emotions is not in the least affected\nby objects; his knowledge is spiritual.\nIV-60. Due to the absence of latent impressions in the mind when nothing is imagined, it remains\nsteady with cognitions similar to those of children and the dumb.\nIV-61. Now the sage is no longer affected; for he resorts to the vast intelligent non-knowing (in the\nobjective mode).\nIV-62. Through the concentration of modelessness, rejecting all latent impressions, he becomes one\nwith it; in the Infinite even that is dissolved.\nIV-63. Though standing, walking, touching, smelling, the intelligent sage, devoid of all clingings, gets\nrid of (fluctuating) pleasures, and the cognitions (of the particulars); he is at peace.\nIV-64. A shoreless ocean of excellences, he crosses the sea of sufferings, because he resorts to this\nvision even in the midst of vexed activities.\nIV-65. Devoid of all particular the stainless, pure Being is one vast essence \u2013 That is held to be the\nabode of (immutable) existence.\nIV-66. Rejecting distinctions like the being of time, the being of instants, the being of entities, be solely\ndevoted to pure Being.\nIV-67. Contemplating but one unqualified universal Being, be omnipresent, full, supremely blissful,\nfilling up all space.\nIV-68. The pristine inconceivable Status, without beginning and end, that remains at the fringe of\nuniversal Being, is causeless.\nIV-69. Cognitions dissolve there. It remains beyond the possibility of doubts. A man who reaches That\nreturns to pains no more.\nIV-70. It is the cause of all beings; itself has no cause. It is the quintessence of all essences; nothing is\nmore quintessential that It.\nIV-71. In that vast mirror of Intelligence, all these perceptions of objects are reflected as the trees on\nthe bank are reflected in the lake.\nIV-72. That is the pure unobscured Truth of the Self; when that is known the mind is tranquillised.\nHaving, through knowledge, won Its essence you become truly free from the fear of samsara.\nIV-73. By the application of the remedies mentioned by me for the causes of suffering, that (supreme)\nstatus is attained.\nIV-74-75. O knower of Truth ! If by manly endeavour you forcefully eschew latent impressions and\nestablish yourself, all alone, in that indestructible status, even for a moment, at the very summit of\nuniversal being, well, at this very moment you achieve it all right;\nIV-76. Or, if you sedulously cultivate the status of universal being, that status you will attain with\nsomewhat greater effort.\nIV-77. Nidagha, if you stay meditating on the principle of cognition, through (still) greater effort you\nwill win that exalted status.\nIV-78. Or, sir, if you strive to shed latent impressions (know) that till the mind is dissolved, the latent\n\nimpressions, too, are not attenuated.\nIV-79. As long as the latent impressions are not attenuated, the mind is not tranquillised; as long as the\nknowledge of truth is not won, whence can come mental tranquillity ?\nIV-80. As long as the mind is not tranquil, Truth cannot be known; so long as the knowledge of Truth is\nnot won whence can mental tranquillity come ?\nIV-81-82. Knowledge of Truth, mind\u2019s destruction, attenuation of latent impressions \u2013 (these) mutually\ncause one another; they are indeed hard to accomplish. Therefore, flinging far from you the desire for\nenjoyment, cultivate this triad.\nIV-83. High-souled one ! Sought for long and simultaneously, the attenuation of latent impressions,\nknowledge (of Truth), and the destruction of the mind are held to prove effective.\nIV-84. By means of these three, cultivated aright, the tough knots of the heart are shattered without\nresidue as are their threads when the lotus stalks are crushed.\nIV-85. Truth-knowers know that breath-control corresponds to the eschewal of latent impressions;\ntherefore, also, practise this latter too, by breath control.\nIV-86. By eschewing latent impressions the mind ceases to be; also by obstructing the vibrations of the\nvital breath (it does so); do (the one or the other) as you choose.\nIV-87. By the steady practice of breath-control, the exercise of reasoning taught by the teacher, the\npractice of Yogic postures and the regulation of diet, the vibration of breath is obstructed.\nIV-88. Through behaviour without attachment, avoidance of contemplation of birth (and empirical life)\nand the perception of the decline of the body, latent impressions cease to operate.\nIV-89. The vibration of the vital breath is indeed the same as mind\u2019s vibration. The intelligent man\nshould strive hard to conquer vibrations of the vital breath.\nIV-90. Without sound reasoning it is impossible to conquer the mind. Resorting to pure cognition and\nrejecting attachment, be steady.\nIV-91. O great-souled one ! Abide solely in the heart, contemplating without conceptions the pristine,\nsingle, matchless and indubitable status of cognition without objects; but perform action, having\nachieved the status of inactivity in the blaze of tranquil glory.\nIV-92. The man who, through ratiocination, in however small a measure, has slain his mind has\nachieved the object of his life.\nV-1. He is said to be dead whose mind is not given over to investigation when he walks or stands; when\nhe is awake or sleep.\nV-2. Know the Spirit-in-Itself to be of the nature of the light of right knowledge. It is fearless; neither\nsubjugated nor depressed.\nV-3. The knower digests (whatever) food he eats \u2013 (whether it is) impure, unwholesome, defiled\nthrough contact with poison, well-cooked or stale, as though it were \u2018sweet\u2019 (i.e. a hearty meal).\nV-4. The (wise) know liberation to be the renunciation of (all) attachment: non-birth results from it.\nGive up attachment to objects; be liberated in life, O sinless one !\nV-5. Attachment is held to be the impure impressions causing reactions like joy and indignation when\nthe objects sought after are present or absent.\nV-6. Pure is the impression latent in the bodies of the liberated in life which does not lead to rebirth and\nis untainted by elation or depression.\nV-7. O Nidagha ! Pains do not depress you; joys do not elate you; abandoning servitude to desires, be\nunattached.\nV-8. \u2018Undetermined by space and time, beyond the purview of \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018is not\u2019, there is but Brahman,\nthe pure indestructible Spirit, quiescent and one; there is nothing else\u2019.\nV-9. Thus thinking, with a body at once present and absent, be (liberated), the silent man, uniform, with\nquiescent mind delighting in the Self.\nV-10. There is neither mind -stuff nor mind; neither nescience nor Jiva. Manifest is the one Brahman\n\nalone, like the sea, without beginning or end.\nV-11. The illusory perception of mind, etc., continues as long as the I-sense is bound up with the body,\nobjects are mistaken for the Self, and the sense of possession, expressed as \u2018this is mine\u2019, persists.\nV-12. Sage ! Illusory perceptions of mind, etc., vanish for one who, through introversion, internally\nburns up, in the fire of the Spirit, the dry grass that is this three-fold world.\nV-13. I am the Self that is the Spirit; I am impartite. I have neither cause not effect. Remember your\nvast (infinite) form; through memory, do not be finitized.\nV-14. By means of the mantra (incantation) of the spiritual science, contemplated within, the deadly\ndisease of craving dwindles as does mist in autumn.\nV-15. (The sages) hold that the best (form of) renunciation, namely that of latent impressions, by virtue\nof knowledge, is the status of Aloneness, as it is pure universal Being.\nV-16. Where latent impressions remain in solution there is \u2018deep sleep\u2019; it does not make for perfection.\nWhere the impressions are seedless, there is \u2018the Fourth\u2019 that yields perfection.\nV-17. Even a very small residue of latent impressions, of fire, debt, disease and adversaries, of\nattachment, enmity and poison affects one adversely.\nV-18. With the seeds of latent impressions consumed, and conformed to universal Being, with or\nwithout a body, one no more partakes of sufferings.\nV-19. The decision, \u2018This is not Brahman\u2019, is the sum total of nescience, whose extinction consists in\n(the opposite) decision, \u2018this is Brahman\u2019.\nV-20. Brahman is Spirit, Brahman is the world. Brahman is the congregation of beings, Brahman is\nmyself, Brahman is the adversary of the Spirit, Brahman is the allies and friends of the Spirit.\nV-21. Once it is realized that Brahman is all, man is Brahman indeed ! One experiences the\nomnipresent Spirit that is peace.\nV-22. When the mind, the guide of unregenerate senses, ceases to operate in regard to the alien, the\nimmaculate, all-pervading awareness (that remains), the Brahman-Intelligence, am I.\nV-23. Resort to that intelligent Self, having discarded all speculations, all curiosity, all vehemence of\nfeelings.\nV-24. Thus intelligent beings, with full knowledge, equanimous, with minds rid of all attachment,\nneither applaud nor condemn either life or death.\nV-25-26. O Brahmin, the vital breath has the ceaseless power of vibration; it always moves. In this\nbody with its ins and outs, this up going vital breath is placed above; the down breath too is similar;\nonly it is stationed below.\nV-27. That best breath control that operates in the expert, whether awake or asleep \u2013 listen to (an\naccount of) that for better being.\nV-28. Puraka is the contact of the body with the up-breaths that move forwards (from the nostrils)\nthrough the space of twelve finger-breadths.\nV-29. Apana (the down-breath) is the moon that keeps the body in well-being, O well-disciplined sage !\nThe up-breath is the sun or the fire which internally warms the body.\nV-30. Resort to the spiritual identity of the down-and-up breaths that dwells near the point where the\nup-breath dwindles and the down-breath rises.\nV-31. Resort to that spiritual, impartite Principle when the down-breath has set and, for a moment, the\nup-breath has not yet arisen.\nV-32. Resort to that spiritual impartite Principle, at the tip of the nose where the breaths revolve, before\nthe down-breath sets while the up-breath has done so.\nV-33. These three worlds are only an appearance, neither existent nor non-existent; (the consequent)\nrenunciation of all concern with an other, the wise maintain, is right knowledge.\nV-34. Noble Brahmin ! Even this appearance is distorted by the mirror of the mind. Therefore, giving\nup that, too, be rid of all appearances.\nV-35. Uprooting this fearful demon of the mind, detrimental to the essence of steadiness, remain what\n\nyou are; be steadfast.\nV-36. The Spirit that is beyond cause and effect and is likened to the (boundless) sky is incapable of\nconfrontation by any (real) object; it remains at the end of all mental processes.\nV-37. The satisfaction (felt) at the moment of desire is caused by that very desire. This satisfaction lasts\nonly till discontent (sets in); therefore, reject desire.\nV-38. Reduce desire to desirelessness; let conceptions cease; let mind grow into mindlessness in the\nprocess of your life without attachment.\nV-39. Acting through sense organs, free from (the force) of latent impulses, like the sky, you would not\nalter though there be a thousand disturbances.\nV-40. Due to the activity and the inactivity of the mind does empirical life start and subside. Through\nthe suppression of latent impulses and the vital breath, reduce the mind to inactivity.\nV-41. Due to the activity and inactivity of the vital breaths does empirical life start and subside.\nThrough drill and application, reduce it to inactivity.\nV-42. Due to the active and passive phases of ignorance do activities get started and cease. Dissolve it\n(ignorance) forcefully by winning a teacher and the instructions of the Shastras.\nV-43. By a mere quiver of the non-objective knowledge or by the suppression of vital breaths is mind\nreduced to mindlessness; that is the supreme status.\nV-44. Through the perception of Brahman, infallibly directed to it (bliss), behold that real bliss\noccasioned by the visioning of the knowable (as Brahman).\nV-45. That indeed is the non-factitious bliss which the mind does not reach; it is free from decline and\ngrowth; it neither rises nor sets.\nV-46. The mind of the knower is not called mind; mind indeed is the Truth of Spirit. Therefore, in the\nFourth state, it transcends that state.\nV-47. Having renounced all mental constructions, equable, and with a quiescent mind, be a sage,\nwedded to the Yoga of renunciation, possessing both knowledge and freedom.\nV-48. The supreme Brahman is that which conforms to no act of mentation. (It is what remains) when\nmental activities completely die down and all masses of latent impulses have been liquidated.\nV-49. By securing right knowledge, and by unremitting concentration, those who become enlightened\nin the wisdom of the Upanishads are the Sankhyas and the others are the Yogins.\nV-50. Those are the Yogins, versed in Yoga, who, after the quiescence of the breaths through ascetic\npractices, achieve the status above sufferings, beginningless and endless.\nV-51. What is required to be won by all is the uncaused and still status; the contemplation of the one\nchangeless Real, the control of breaths, the dwindling of the mind.\nV-52. When one of them is perfected, it helps perfect the others (also). The vital breaths and mind of\nliving beings are all concomitant.\nV-53. Like the container and the content they perish when only one is present. Through self-destruction\nthey produce that best of products, namely, liberation.\nV-54. If, remaining steady, you reject all this by understanding, then, on the cessation of the I-sense,\nyou yourself are the supreme Status.\nV-55. There is but one great Spirit, which is called the Being; it is flawless, even, pure, free from the Isense.\nV-56. It shines forth but once, the pure, the ever risen, the same. It is described by many names, as\nBrahman, the supreme Self, etc.\nV-57. O Nidagha, knowing for creation \u2018I am That\u2019, having done what had to be accomplished, I never\nthink of the past or the future.\nV-58. I cling wholly to the vision that is present here (and now). \u2018This have I won today; I shall achieve\nthis beautiful\u2019 (thing).\nV-59. I laud not; neither do I condemn. Nothing other than the self is anywhere. The gaining of the\ngood does not gladden me; evil betiding me does not sadden me.\n\nV-60. Sage, the waverings of my mind have been totally stilled; it is rod of all sorrow. It is cured of all\nwantings. It is tranquil. Therefore I am hale, and untrammelled.\nV-61. \u2018This is a friend; that is a foe; this is mind; that is a stranger\u2019 \u2013 this sort of knowledge does not\noccur to me, O Brahmin; no affection touches me.\nV-62. Rid of all latent impressions, the mind is liberated from old age and death. Mind with latent\nimpressions inherent in it is knowledge. What is to be known is the mind rid of all latent impressions.\nV-63. When the mind is rejected, this duality on all sides is dissolved; but remains the tranquil supreme\nOne, pure and untrammelled.\nV-64. The endless, unborn, unmanifest, unageing, tranquil, unlapsing, non-dual, beginningless and\nendless which (nevertheless) is the first Apprehension.\nV-65. One, devoid of beginning and end, wholly spirit, pure, pervasive, subtler far than the sky; thou art\nthat Brahman indubitably.\nV-66. Undetermined by space, time, etc.; superlatively pure, ever arisen, omnipresent, this one End is\nall-in-all; be thou that pure Spirit.\nV-67. \u2018All is this tranquil one, devoid of beginning, middle and end. All is unborn, both Being and nonbeing' \u2013 so thinking, be happy.\nV-68. I am not bound nor liberated. I am indeed the untrammelled Brahman. I am free from duality. I\nam being, Intelligence, bliss.\nV-69. Keeping far away the entire multitude of objects, be you ever devoted to the Self, your mind all\ncooled.\nV-70. \u2018This is fine; this is not ! -- such (feeling) is the seed of your extended sorrow. When that is\nburned in the fire of impartiality, where is the occasion for sorrow ?\nV-71. First augment wisdom by means of familiarity with the Shastras and by seeking the company of\nthe holy.\nV-72. The true, real and ultimate Brahman, superlatively pure, eternal, without beginning and end, is\nthe cure for all forms of transmigratory life.\nV-73. So also is It neither coarse nor spaced; neither tangible nor visible; It is tasteless and scentless;\nunknowable and peerless.\nV-74. Well disciplined (sage) ! For achieving liberation, one should meditate on the bodiless Self that is\nBrahman - Being consciousness and Bliss without end \u2013 as \u2018I am (That)\u2019.\nV-75. Concentration is the origination of knowledge in regard to the unity of the Supreme and the Jiva.\nThe Self, verily, is eternal, omnipresent, immutable and flawless.\nV-76. Being (but) one, through Maya it splits up; not in Its essence. Therefore the non-dual alone is; no\nmanifold, no empirical life (is there).\nV-77. Just as space is called \u2018Pot-space\u2019 (and) \u2018great space\u2019, so, due to delusion, is the self called Jiva\nand Ishvara in two ways.\nV-78. When the all-pervading spirit shines always without a break in the mind of the Yogin then one\nbecomes one\u2019s Self.\nV-79. Verily, when one beholds all beings in one\u2019s own Self, and one\u2019s Self in all beings, one becomes\nBrahman.\nV-80. In the state of concentration, atoned with the Supreme, one beholds no beings; one then is the\nAlone.\nV-81. The first plane, generating the desire for liberation, is marked by the practice (of discipline) and\ndetachment due to intimacy with the Shastras and the company of the holy.\nV-82. The second is marked by investigation; the third by contemplation with (all) its accessories; the\nfourth is the solvent as it consists in the dissolution of latent impressions.\nV-83. The fifth is the rapturous; it is purely cognitive. This is the station of the Liberated-in-life who is,\nas it were, half awake and half asleep.\nV-84. The sixth plane is non-cognitive. It is the station similar to deep sleep, having the nature of pure\n\nand massive bliss.\nV-85. The seventh plane is (marked by) equability, utter purity, tenderness; it is indeed unqualified\nliberation, the quiescent Fourth State.\nV-86. The transcendent state beyond the Fourth, Nirvana in its essence, is the transcendent and\ndeveloped seventh plane; it does not come within the purview of mortals.\nV-87. The first three constitute but the wakeful life; the fourth is called the dream (state) where the\nworld is regrettably dream-like.\nV-88. The fifth, conforming to massive bliss, is styled deep sleep. In contrast the sixth which is noncognitive is named the Fourth State.\nV-89. The most excellent seventh plane is the state beyond the Fourth, beyond the range of mind and\nwords, and identified with the self-luminous Being.\nV-90. If due to the withdrawal (of the cognitive organs) into (one\u2019s self) no object is perceived., (one) is\nliberated, indeed, indubitably by that mighty sameness (of vision).\nV-91. \u2018I die not; neither do I live; being preponderantly non-existent, I am existent neither. \u2018I am\nnothing (but) Spirit\u2019, so thinking the intelligent Jivanmukta sorrows not.\nV-92. \u2018Stainless am I; unageing and unattached, with latent impressions all tranquillised. I am\nimpartite, (the veritable) Spirit-sky\u2019, so thinking he sorrows not.\nV-93. \u2018Rid of the I-sense, pure, awake, unageing, immortal peaceful (am I), all appearances have been\nquietened for me\u2019, so thinking he sorrows not.\nV-94. \u2018I am one with Him who dwells at the tips of grass, in the sky, in the Sun, in man, the mountain,\nand the gods\u2019, so thinking he sorrows not.\nV-95. Discarding all mental constructions about objects, rising well above them, dwell on the thought\n\u2018I, the free, am the supreme Brahman that remains\u2019.\nV-96. Beyond the purview of words, rid of the predicament of hankering after objects, unagitated even\nby the flavour of climatic bliss, he delights in the Self by himself.\nV-97. Renouncing all actions, ever content, independent, neither by virtue, sin nor aught else is he\nstained.\nV-98. Just as a mirror is not stained by reflections, so is the b-Knower inwardly unstained by actions\u2019\nfruits.\nV-99. Freely moving amidst the masses, he knows neither pains nor pleasures when his body is tortured\nor honoured, as if these are directed to (one\u2019s) reflections.\nV-100. Beyond praise and change, recognising neither worship nor its object, at once conforming and\nindifferent to all codes of etiquette,\nV-101. Let him give up his body either in a holy spot or in the hut of an eater of dog\u2019s flesh: Once\nknowledge is won, one becomes Jnanin (a knower) of Brahman, free from all latent impressions of\nKarma.\nV-102. The cause of bondage is mental construction; give that up. Liberation comes through the\nabsence of mental construction; practise it intelligently.\nV-103. In the context of objects, sense-organs and their contact by wary, perpetually and steadily\navoiding states of mental construction.\nV-104. Do not succumb to objects; neither identify (yourself) with the sense-organs. Having renounced\nall constructions, identify with what remains.\nV-105. If anything please you, then in a state of bondage are you in empirical life; if nothing pleases\nyou, then (indeed) are you liberated here.\nV-106. In the multitude of objects, moving and stationery, extending from grass, etc.; upto the living\nbodies, let there be nothing that gives you pleasure.\nV-107. In the absence of the I-sense and its negation, at once existent and non-existent, what remains\nunattached, self-same, superlatively pure, and steadfast is said to be the Fourth.\nV-108. That superlatively pure sameness, the quiescent status of liberation-in-life, the state of the\n\nspectator is, inempirical usage, called the fourth state.\nV-109. This is neither wakefulness nor dream, for there is no room for mental constructions. Neither is\nthis the state of deep sleep; for no inertness is involved in this.\nV-110. This world as it is, is dissolved, and then it is the Fourth State for those who are tranquillised\nand rightly awakened; for the unawakened it stands changeless (as it is in its plurality).\nV-111. When the aspect of I-sense is given up, and equability dominates, and the mind disintegrates,\nthe Fourth State comes on.\nV-112. The repudiation of the objective manifold is the doctrine of the Shastras setting forth the Spirit.\nHere is neither avidya nor Maya; this is the tranquil Brahman, unfatigued.\nV-113. One is inevitably tranquillised in the clear sky of the Spirit, known as Brahman whose essence\nis quietude and equability and which is resplendent with all powers.\nV-114. Giving up everything, be wedded to an immense silence, O sinless one ! Plunged into Nirvana,\nlifted above ratiocination, with mind attenuated and intellect becalmed.\nV-115. With a tranquillised mind abide in the Self, like one dumb, blind and deaf; ever turned inward,\nsuperlatively pure, with brimming inner wisdom.\nV-116. O twice born, perform acts, remaining in deep slumber in wakefulness itself. Having internally\nrenounced everything, act externally as occasion arises.\nV-117. Mind\u2019s being alone is suffering; the giving up of the mind alone is joy. Therefore, through noncognition (of objects) attenuate the mind in the sky of the Spirit.\nV-118. Seeing that the beautiful or the ugly always remains, like a stone, irremovable \u2013 thus, through\none\u2019s own effort, is empirical existence conquered.\nV-119. What is hidden in the Vedanta, taught in bygone ages, should not be offered to one who is not\nestablished in peace; neither to one who is not a son or pupil.\nV-120. Whoever studies the Annapurnopanishad with the blessing of (one\u2019s) teacher become a\nJivanmukta, and by himself altogether Brahman \u2013 This is the Upanishad.\nOm !

May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nPART-I\nThen the blessed Samkriti repaired to the solar world. Bowing down to the sun, he glorified the Sun by\nmeans of the science of the Wise:\nOm, Salutation to the blessed Lord, the glorious Sun, to the Power of the eye.\nOm, Salutation to the Sky-Wanderer.\nOm, Salutation to the Commander of the Army (of light).\nOm, Salutation to darkness (excess of light).\nOm, Salutation to Energy.\nOm, Salutation to Light.\nLead me from the unreal to the Real; lead me from darkness to Light; lead me from death to\nImmortality.\nOf the essence of Purity, the blessed One scorches (the sins of the sinful).

(I meditate\non Him who is) omniform, compassionate, omniscient, ambrosial, of the essence of light, the Scorcher.\nOm, Salutation to the blessed Lord, the Sun, the Offspring of the Infinite, the Power of the eye. The\nflood of days ! The flood !! All Hail !\nThus glorified by means of the science of the Wise the-Lord-in-the-form-of-the-Sun was highly\ngratified. He said: Whichever Brahmana studies without break this science of the Wise never contracts\n\nany eye-disease. None is born blind in his family. Teaching this to eight Brahmanas one becomes\nperfect in this science. Whosoever knows this is magnified.\nPART-II\n1. Then verily Samkriti said to the Sun: Blessed One, teach me Brahma-vidya. The Sun told him:\nSamkriti, listen. I shall set forth the knowledge of Reality, so hard to come by; by which knowledge\nalone will you become liberated while living in the body.\n2. All is one, unborn, tranquil, endless, certain, immutable. See Reality as Spirit; be tranquil and at\nease.\n3. (The adepts) know Yoga to be the non-knowing (of plurality), the spontaneous attrition of the\n(object-seeking) mind. Rooted in Yoga, perform actions, or, averse (to all actions), perform (them) not\nat all.\n4. Aversion is felt everyday to inborn tendencies (to act); nevertheless, one tends to plunge into noble\nactions with gusto.\n5-6. Always one hesitates as regards the instinctive actions of the unregenerate; one never refers to\nwhat may compromise others, but attends to their righteous deeds. One does gentle deeds that pain\nnone; always dreads sin and avoids all forms of sense-gratification.\n7. Such a one\u2019s speech is informed by affection and love; it is lovely and fit, with due regard to time\nand place.\n8. With proper thought, act and speech, one waits upon the virtuous. Getting them from all conceivable\nsources, one studies the Shastras.\n9-10(a). Then one attains the first stage of Yoga. Whoever entertains such thoughts as regards the\ncrossing of transmigratory life is said to have attained a state of Yoga. The rest are said to be just\n\u2018noble\u2019 (arya).\n10(b)-11. Coming to the next stage of Yoga, called \u2018Analysis\u2019 (vichara), the sadhaka resorts to the\nforemost scholars, well-known for their serious interpretations of Sruti and Smriti, good conduct, fixed\nattention, contemplation and activities.\n12. As a house-holder (knows) his homestead, (so), having mastered all that has to be learned, the\nsadhaka comes to know the categories, and the doctrines, vis-\u00e0-vis what has to be done and avoided.\n13. As a snake sheds its Slough, so sheds he even a slight attachment to external objects when\nintensified by pride, conceit, intolerance, greed and delusion.\n14. With a mind disciplined through devotion to the Shastras, teacher, and the company of the virtuous,\nhe truthfully masters the entire body of knowledge including the secret doctrines.\n15. Just as a lover repairs to a spotless bed of flowers, from the second, he (the sadhaka) proceeds to\nthe third state styled Non-attachment.\n16-17. Fixing his steady mind on the truthful import of the Shastras and busy with the recitation of\nspiritual texts proper to the hermitages of the ascetics, he expends his long life, seated on a bed of stone\nor a slab, diverting himself with ramblings in the forest, made beautiful by his placid mind.\n18. As a result of his meritorious actions, the righteous (sadhaka) passes his time in the delights of\ndetachment, repeatedly studying the positive Shastras.\n19. One\u2019s perception of reality becomes clear only in due course. The enlightened one, reaching the\nthird stage, experiences this for himself.\n20. Non-attachment is of two kinds: listen to the distinction as it is being drawn. This non-attachment is\nof two-kinds; one general and the other, superior.\n21. The general non-attachment is non-involvement in objects, (based on the perception) \u2018I am neither\nagent nor enjoyer, neither the sublater nor the sublated\u2019.\n22. \u2018Everything, be it pleasure or pain, is fashioned by prior deeds; or, everything is under the sway of\nthe Lord. I do nothing in regard to it\u2019.\n23. \u2018Enjoyments and non-enjoyments are dread diseases; possessions are great disasters. All contacts\n\njust promote separation. Sufferings are diseases of thoughts\u2019.\n24. \u2018Time is ceaselessly fashioning all things\u2019 \u2013 so the general non-attachment of (the sadhaka) who has\ngrasped the import of (the major texts) consists in being averse to all things and in not dwelling on\nthem mentally.\n25-26. By cultivating this sequence (of stages), the superior non-attachment in the case of the\nmagnanimous (sadhakas) supervenes. It is said to be silence, repose and quiescence. For speech and\nimport have been flung far away in the light of the truth, \u2018I am no agent; the agent is God or my own\nprior actions\u2019.\n27. The first stage that occurs is sweet on account of the satisfaction and joy (that attend it). The\nsadhaka (puman) has just stepped into the sequence of states. The first is an ambrosial sprout.\n28. The first stage is the internal, cleansed, birth-place of the other stages. Thence one attains the\nsecond and third stages.\n29. Among these, the all-pervading third (stage) is superior. Here the sadhaka has outgrown all\nproneness to imagine (and get ensnared).\n30. Those who reach the fourth (stage) after the dwindling of nescience through the exercises of the\nthree stages look on all things with the same eye.\n31. When non-duality is established and duality dissolved, those who have reached the fourth stage\nlook upon the phenomenal world as a dream.\n32. The first three states are said to be the waking state; the fourth is called the dream state. And the\nmind dissolves like the fragments of an autumnal cloud.\n33. He who reaches the fifth stage survives but as bare being. Due to the dissolution of the mind in this\nstage the world-manifold does not present itself at all.\n34. Reaching the fifth stage called \u2018deep sleep\u2019, the sadhaka remains as pure non-dual being, all\nparticulars having completely vanished.\n35. Having reached the fifth stage, one stays consolidated in deep sleep, joyful, inwardly awake, all\ndual appearances gone.\n36. Looking inwards, even when attending to outer things, he appears always indrawn, being extremely\nexhausted.\n37. Practising in this fifth stage, free from all innate impulses, one reaches, as a matter of course, the\nsixth stage named \u2018the Fourth\u2019.\n38. Where there is neither the non-existent nor the existent, neither the \u2018I\u2019 nor the non-\u2018I\u2019, with all\nanalytic thinking gone, one stays alone, totally fearless, in non-duality.\n39. Beyond knots, with all doubt vanquished, liberated in life, devoid of imaginations, though\nunextinguished yet extinguished, he is like a painted flame.\n40. Having dwelt in the sixth stage, he shall reach the seventh. The state of disembodied liberation is\ncalled the seventh stage of Yoga.\n41-42(a). This is the acme of all stages, beyond words, quiescent. Avoiding conformity with the ways\nof the world, and the ways of the body, avoiding conformity with Shastras, get rid of all\nsuperimpositions on the Self.\n42(b). All that is (here), the vishva, the prajna, etc., is nothing but Om.\n43. Because there is non-difference between import and expression, and because, as distinct from each\nother, neither of these two is known, the Vishva is just the letter \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018u\u2019 is said to be the Taijasa.\n44. The Prajna is the letter \u2018m\u2019. Thus know in order, discriminating with great effort, before\nConcentration (Samadhi) sets in.\n45-46. In this due order the concrete and the subtle should all be dissolved in the spiritual Self and the\nspiritual Self (should be dissolved) perceiving \u2018I am the Om Vasudeva, ever pure, awake, free, existent,\nnon-dual massed and supreme bliss\u2019; because all this (objective world) is pain in the beginning, middle\nand end.\n47-48. Therefore, thou sinless one, renouncing everything, be devoted to Truth. Think: I am Brahman,\n\nsolid Intelligence and Bliss, free from impurity, holy, lifted above mind and words, beyond the\ndarkness of ignorance, beyond all appearances. This is the secret doctrine.\nOm! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Akshyupanishad belonging to the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Adhyatma": "\nAdhyatma Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm! Let there be Peace in me!\nLet there be Peace in my environment!\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me!\nIn the cave of the body is eternally set the one unborn.\nThe earth is His body.

(Though) moving within Death, Death knows Him not.\nHe, then, is the inner-self of all beings, sinless, heaven-born, luminous, the sole Narayana.\n1. Superimposition is the thought, 'I' am and mine are the body, the senses, etc., which are all other than\nthe Self. Through devotion to Brahman, the wise man should repudiate it.\n\n2. Knowing oneself to be the subject, the witness of intellect and its operations, reject the idea of the\nSelf being other than the subject, identifying the 'I' with that (the subject).\n3. Rejecting conformity with the world, the body, and the Shastras, remove superimposition on the Self.\n4. The mind of the Yogin perishes as he stays without intermission in the Self alone, knowing, through\nreasoning, Shruti, and experience, that one is the Self of all beings.\n5. Without granting for a moment even a toe-hold for sleep, gossip, verbal exchanges, etc., and selfforgetfulness, meditate on the Self in the self.\n6. Casting the body far aside, the offspring of parental exudations, as its status is no better than that of\nan outcast, and becoming Brahman, seek fulfilment.\n7. Dissolve the self in the supreme Self as the pot-space is dissolved in infinite space; then, as the\nInfinite be silent for ever, O sage!\n8. Having become the self-luminous Substratum, as Being, reject both the macrocosm and the\nmicrocosm which are but abodes of impurities.\n9. Locating the body-bound I-sense in the ever-blissful spiritual Self, renounce the subtle body;\neternally be the Absolute.\n10. Knowing 'I am that Brahman' in which this world appearance (exists) like a city reflected in a\nmirror, find fulfilment, O sinless one!\n11. Liberated from the grip of egoism, like the moon (after the eclipse), full, ever blissful, selfluminous, one attains one's essence.\n12. The destruction of actions leads to that of thought; thence results the dwindling of innate impulses\n(to act). The obliteration of innate impulses is liberation; it is held to be freedom in life.\n13. At all places and by all means, perceiving everything as Spirit, one achieves the dissolution of\ninnate impulses as it strengthens the attitude of universal good will.\n14. Never should one be heedless in devotion to Brahman; 'heedlessness is death' so aver the\nphilosophers of Brahman in regard to (this) science.\n15. Just as a pulled-up water-reed stays not still, even for a moment, so does Maya (ceaselessly)\nenvelop even a wise man if he averts his face (from the Truth).\n16. Whosoever wins absoluteness while alive continues to be absolute even after death. Rooted in\nconcentration, O sinless one, remain steadfast.\n17. With the vision of the non-dual Self through unwavering concentration comes the dissolution\nwithout residue of the knots of ignorance in the heart.\n18. Strengthening the sense of Self vis-\u00e0-vis this vision, and rejecting it vis-\u00e0-vis the ego, etc., remain\nindifferent to them all, as to objects like pots and clothes.\n\n19. All things from Brahma down to clumps of grass are nothing but unreal adjuncts. Distinct from the,\nsee one's Self existing as the immutable plenum.\n20. One's Self is Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and Shiva; this entire world is one's Self; other than this Self,\nthere is nothing.\n21. After repudiating all objective appearances superimposed on one's Self, one remains alone as the\nsupreme Brahman, full, non-dual, stirless.\n22. The world is a postulation, as good as non-existent, in the one Reality that is immutable, formless,\nunqualified; whence is difference?\n23. (In the one Reality) devoid of distinctions like the percipient, perception, and the perceived, and of\nall sufferings, in the absolutely full, spiritual, Self, like unto the ocean at the time of cosmic dissolution,\n(whence is difference)?\n24. Darkness implicit in It as in light is the cause of delusion. Whence is difference in the supreme nondual and unqualified Reality?\n25. In this uniform and supreme Reality, how can the agent of differences dwell? In deep sleep that is\nnothing but bliss who has perceived difference?\n26. This perception of difference is rooted in the mind (of the percipient); there is none of it in the\nabsence of the mind. Therefore, concentrate the mind on the supreme Self as the subject.\n27. Upon realizing the Self that is impartite bliss as one's own essence (there follows) the savouring of\nthe timeless bliss that is the Self, both externally and internally.\n28. Of detachment the fruit is knowledge: of knowledge the fruit is withdrawal. Experience of Self as\nbliss leads to peace; again, peace is the fruit of withdrawal.\n29. Without the consequent states, the precedent ones are fruitless, indeed. Cessation is supreme\nsatisfaction; matchless bliss is spontaneous.\n30. The expressed sense of the word tat (God) has Maya for His adjunct; He is the world-cause. He is\ncharacterised by omniscience, etc.; is tinged by transcendence, and is essentially Truth and so forth.\n31. The expressed sense of the word 'Tvam' shines forth as the content of the idea and expression 'I'; it\nis awareness blended with the mind (the inner organ of perception).\n32. Only through the exclusion of Maya and avidya, the adjuncts of God and Jiva is the supreme Spirit,\nthe impartite Being, Consciousness and Bliss, indicated.\n33. 'To listen', thus is to pursue by means of sentences their import. On the other hand, 'thinking'\nconsists in perceiving its consistency with reason.\n34. 'Meditation' is indeed the exclusive attention of the mind fixed on (the import) rendered indubitable\nthrough listening and thinking.\n\n35. 'Concentration' is said to be the mind which, outgrowing the dualism between the meditator and\nmeditation, gradually dwells exclusively on the object (of meditation) and is like a flame in a windless\nspot.\n36. Mind's modifications in regard to the Self are uncognized in that state; they are (only) inferred as\npast, after quitting the state of Samadhi.\n37. Crores of karmans, accumulated in this beginningless transmigratory life, are dissolved by means of\nconcentration: (then) pure virtue begins to flourish.\n38. The best knowers of Yoga call this concentration the cloud of virtues, since it rains the flood-waters\nof virtue in a thousand streams.\n39-40. When the load of innate impulses is dissolved without residue by means of this (cloud of\nvirtues) and heaps of karmans, good and evil, are totally eradicated, the major text, which at first shone\nforth immediately, now unobstructed, yields immediate awareness as (clear) as the myrobalan in the\npalm (of one's hand).\n41. The non-occurrence of the impulse (to enjoy, etc.,) in regard to the objects of enjoyment marks the\nacme of detachment. The highest pitch of awareness is (marked by) the non-occurrence of the egoistic\nsense.\n42(a). The acme of withdrawal is (marked by) the non-occurrence of (even) the latent impulse (to\nenjoy).\n42(b). He is the ascetic of steadfast wisdom who enjoys bliss for ever;\n43-44(a). Whose self is merged in Brahman alone; who is immutable and quiescent. Wisdom (prajna) is\ndefined as the unwavering spiritual mode whose content is the unity of Brahman and Atman purged (of\nall adjuncts).\n44(b). Whosoever possesses it (wisdom) without a break is liberated in life;\n45. Who has no conceit of 'I' in regard to body and senses; nor the conceit of objects in regard to things\nother than them - who is free from these two conceits in regard to anything whatsoever is liberated-inlife;\n46. Who, in his wisdom, perceives no difference between the subject and Brahman; who neither refers\nto the creator nor creation is liberated in life.\n47. Whose attitude is the same both when he is honoured by the virtuous and when he is persecuted by\nthe wicked is liberated in life.\n48. He who has realized the truth of Brahman no longer transmigrates, as hitherto; if he does, this truth\nhas not been realized by him; he is but an extrovert.\n49. As long as the experience of pleasure, etc., lasts, so long operative karmans from the past are held\nto persist. (Causal) actions precede the occurrence of effects; never is this unpreceded by actions.\n\n50. Consequent on the experience 'I am Brahman', karmans accumulated in the course of aeons are\ndissolved, even as the actions in dreams are, upon waking up.\n51. Just as nothing clings to space, so to the sage, who knows the Self to be unattached and indifferent,\nfuture actions cling not in the least degree.\n52. Just as space is unaffected by the smell of liquor though it touches the pot (containing the liquor),\nso is Self unaffected by the attributes of Its adjuncts.\n53. Karmans done before the dawn of knowledge perish not as a result of that knowledge; they must\nproduce their proper effect even as an arrow shot to hit a target (stops not before hitting it).\n54. The arrow discharged (to hit) what was taken for a tiger stops not, though, alter, (the target) is\nknown to be a cow; the target is hit with full force.\n55. 'I am un-ageing'; 'I am immortal' - how can one who knows his Self to be such and lives that\nknowledge fabricate operative past actions?\n56. Then only is operative past action real when one mistakes one's Self to be the body. The treatment\nof the body as Self is improper; therefore reject (the notion) of operative past action.\n57. The fabrication of operative past actions is also, indeed, a delusion due to this body.\n58. How can the superimposed be real? How can the unreal be born? How can the unborn perish? How\ncan the unreal own operative past actions?\n59-60. To answer the dull-witted (who) doubtfully ask how this body persists if the entire effects of\nnescience with their cause are destroyed by knowledge, Shruti, with an outward eye, propounds the\ntheory of operative past actions; not to suggest to the wise that the body, etc., are real.\n61. A total plenum, without beginning and end, measure and change.\nMassed being and intelligence, massed eternal bliss, undiminishing,\n62. With the sole savour of the subject, full, endless, behold all,\nNeither to be shunned nor seized, neither to be held nor propped;\n63. Beyond inert forces and actions, subtle, certain, unblemished;\nWhose essence is beyond thought, beyond mid and words;\n64.

After studying the scriptures during the blemishless period of studentship in which he devotes\nhimself to the service of the teacher, the Brahmacharin with the permission of the teacher, shall marry a\nsuitable wife. Then (at the end of the householder\u2019s life) he shall kindle the sacred fire (for\nrenunciation) bravely and perform a sacrifice lasting a day and night in which Brahma, etc., are the\ndeities.\n3. Then after dividing his property among his sons in the proper way and giving up all sensory\npleasures, he shall journey along sacred places as a Vanaprastha.\n4. Subsisting on air only or on (air and) water only or with the addition (in dire need) of approved\nbulbous roots (and fruits) he shall find all worldly life in his person alone. He shall not (remembering\nhis past comforts) allow his tears fall on the ground.\n5-7(a). How can a man, in the company of his wife, be said to have renounced (worldly life) ? How can\none who is (merely) known with an appellation (of an ascetic) be said to have renounced ? Hence he\nshould purify himself (first) by renouncing the result of his deeds through self-control (Vanaprastha);\nthereafter he may take to renunciation. One reaches the stage of forest-life (Vanaprastha) after having\nmaintained the sacred fire (as a householder). He goes to lead the forest-life with self-control\n\naccompanied by his wife as though he were a person attached to her.\n7(b)-8. \u2018Why does he undergo (the life of a mendicant monk) in vain, having given up the happiness of\nworldly life ? What is that (impending) misery the thought of which should make him abandon great\npleasures ?\u2019 (Such is the query of the wife). \u2018I am afraid of the (miserable) life in the womb (of another\nmother) and also the miseries of heat, cold, etc. (So) I wish to enter the cave(-shelter) of renunciation,\nthe means for the painless transcendent state (of Brahman)\u2019. Thus (he replies).\n9. Having renounced the sacred fire he shall not return to it (even in mentally reciting the mantras\npertaining to it).\n10. \u2018For, I, (i.e. the mantra) (pertaining to this sacred fire) becoming extinct (being incompatible with\nrenunciation) shall be merged into the oncoming (knowledge of Brahman).\u2019\n11. He may repeat the mantras pertaining to Self (realization).\n12. He shall have consecration. (He shall be) wearing (ochre) coloured garment. (He shall remove) the\nhairs excluding those in the arm pits and the private parts. With (right) hand raised (he shall set forth as\na mendicant monk), abandoning the path of worldly life. He shall move on without (a fixed) abode.\nLiving on alms, he shall deeply ponder over (Vedantic texts) and meditate (on his identity with the\ntranscendent Brahman). He shall possess pure knowledge (pavitram) for the protection of all beings.\n13-14. (These) verses are there (or the same theme): (The mendicant monk shall have) a water pot, an\n(alms-) bowl, a sling (to carry his effects), sandals to traverse a long distance (literally, over the three\nworlds), a patched garment to withstand cold, a loin cloth to cover (his privities), a purifying ring\n(pavitram of holy grass), a bath towel and an upper garment; other than these the ascetic shall give up\nall else.\n15. He shall sleep on the sandy bed of a river or outside a temple. He shall not bother his body too\nmuch either with pleasures or pain.\n16. Pure water should be used for bathing, drinking and cleansing. He shall not become pleased with\npraise nor shall he curse others when censured.\n17. His alms-bowl shall be (a cup) made of leaves and the material for washing shall be the prescribed\n(fresh earth).\n18. Thus provided with the means of living, he shall, with the senses subdued, always mutter the\n(philosophical) mantras. The wise (ascetic) shall realize in his mind (the identity of the individual self\nwith the universal Self) which is the meaning of Om.\n19. (From Brahman arose ether); from ether air; from air fire; from fire water; from water the earth. To\n(the prime cause of all) these primary elements. Brahman, I resort (in reverence); I resort to the ageless,\nimmortal and indestructible Brahman.\n20. In me, the ocean of unalloyed bliss, many a time arise and fall waves of the universe due to the\nwinds of the fanciful sport of illusion (Maya).\n21. I am not attached to my body just as the sky is not attached to the clouds. Hence how can I have its\n(i.e. the body\u2019s) characteristics during (the stages of) waking, dreaming and deep sleep ?\n22. I am always far beyond imagination like ether; I am different from it (the body) as the sun is from\nthe objects of illumination; I am ever changeless just like the unchangeable (i.e. the Meru mountain)\nand, like the ocean am I limitless.\n23. I am Narayana, I am the destroyer of the (demon) Naraka, I am (Siva), the destroyer of the three\n(aerial) cities, I am the Purusha, I am the supreme Lord; I am the indivisible consciousness, the witness\nof all; I am without a superior, I am devoid of \u2018I-ness\u2019 (egotism) and \u2018mine-ness\u2019 (possessiveness).\n24-25. (The ascetic) shall, by the practice (of Yoga) bring together the Prana and Apana vital airs in the\nbody. He shall place the (palms of the) two hands at the perineum, gently biting the (tip of the) tongue\nthrust out to the extent of a grain of barley. Similarly directing the eyes open to the extent of a\nblackgram seed, towards the (ether of the) ear (and the feet firmly resting) on the ground, he shall not\nallow the ear (to function) and the nose to smell (i.e. the five senses shall be controlled). (Thus he\naccomplishes the union of the Prana and Apana vital airs).\n\n26. (Therefore the vital air passing through the Kundalini and the Susumna gets dissolved in the\nSahasrarachakra at the top of the head. Then the vision, the mind, vital air and the \u2018fire\u2019 of the body\nreach) the seat of Siva (and get dissolved); that is Brahman; that is the transcendent Brahman. That\n(Brahman) will be realized by the practice (of Yoga), which is facilitated by the acquisition of practice\nin previous births.\n27. With the (help of the) external and internal organs (the knowledge of the qualified Brahman) called\neffulgence, reaching the heart and supported by the vital air\u2019s capability (to proceed upwards, goes\nthrough the Susumna Nadi) and piercing the skull at the top of the body, one realizes the indestructible\n(qualified Brahman).\n28. Those (sages) who attain the transcendent state (through the passage) in the skull at the top of their\nbody, do never return (to the worldly life) for they realize the lower as well as the higher (Brahman).\n29. The attributes of objects seen do not affect the onlooker who is different from them. The attributes\nof a householder do not affect him who remains non-aligned without any mental modification, just as a\nlamp (which suffers no change by the objects revealed by it).\n30. Let (me) the non-aligned (sage) roll in water or on the ground; I am untouched by their\ncharacteristics just as the ether (in the pot) is not affected by the attributes of the pot.\n31-32. I am free (from the effect) of activities, and changes, devoid of parts and form, I am without\nfancies, I am eternal , I am without a support and I am devoid of duality. I am the form of all (beings), I\nam the all, I am beyond everything and without a second; I am the one indivisible knowledge and I am\nthe compact bliss of the Self.\n33. Seeing everywhere the Self, considering the Self as without a second, enjoying the bliss of the Self,\nI remain without reflections.\n34. Walking, standing, sitting, lying or otherwise, the wise sage delighting in the Atman shall live as he\nwishes (fulfilling his duties; and on leaving the world, will attain final liberation).

Agni is Savitar, earth is Savitri.\nWhere there is Agni there is earth and where is earth there is Agni. The two are causes forming one\npair. Varuna alone is Savitar, water \u2013 Savitri. When there is Varuna etc., -- they are the sources, forming\na pair.\n3-6. (Again) Air alone is Savitar, ether is Savitri. Where there is air there is ether (and vice versa) \u2013\nthey are twin sources, forming a pair. Sacrifice alone is Savitar and metres are Savitri \u2013 where there is\nsacrifice there are metres (and vice versa). Thunder is Savitar and lightning is Savitri; where there is\nlightning (and vice versa). These two are twin sources.\n7-8. The moon is Savitar and stars are Savitri. Where there is the moon, there are the stars (and vice\nversa) \u2013 these two are twin sources.\n9. Man is Savitar, woman is Savitri. Where there is a man there is a woman and vice versa. They form\none pair of sources.\n10. Mind is Savitar and world is Savitri \u2013 where there is mind, there is woman (and vice versa) \u2013 these\ntwo are twin sources.\n11. Of Savitri the first foot is Earth. \u2018Of that Savitar, the admirable; fire indeed is adorable, water and\n\nmoon are adorable. The second foot is Bhuvar, the mind region; \u2018we meditate on the radiance of that\ndeity\u2019 \u2013 the fire is the radiance; sun, moon are radiance.\n12. The third foot is the firmament \u2013 which may inspire our thoughts \u2013 this woman and man bring\nforth.\n13. He who knows this Savitri conquers death.\n14-15. Of Bala and Atibala Virat Purusha is the seer, Gayatri the metre and deity.

Now Angirah: The Spirit, manifests Itself, in three ways: the self, the inner Self and the supreme\nSelf.\nI-2. There are the organs \u2013 the skin, inner and outer: flesh, hair, the thumb, the fingers, the backbone,\nthe nails, the ankles, the stomach, the navel, the penis, the hip, the thighs, the cheeks, the ears, the\nbrows, the forehead, the hands, the flanks, the head and the eyes; these are born and these die; so they\nconstitute the self.\nI-3. Next this inner self is (indicated by the elements) earth, water, fire, air, ether, desire, aversion,\npleasure, pain, desire, delusion, doubts, etc., and memory, (marked by) the high pitch and\naccentlessness, short, long and prolate (vowel sounds), the hearer, smeller, taster, leader, agent and self\nof knowledge vis-\u00e0-vis stumbling, shouting, enjoying, dancing, singing and playing on musical\ninstruments. He is the ancient spirit that distinguishes between Nyaya, Mimamsa and the institutes of\nlaw and the specific object of listening, smelling and grasping. He is the inner Self.\nI-4. Next the supreme Self, the imperishable, He is to meditated on with (the help of) the Yogic steps,\nbreath control, withdrawal (of sense organs), fixation (of mind), contemplation and concentration, He is\nto be inferred by the thinkers on the Self as like unto the seed of the Banyan tree or a grain of millet or\n\na hundredth part of a split hair. (Thus) is He won and not known. He is not born, does not die, does not\ndry, is not wetted, not burnt, does not tremble, is not split, does not sweat. He is beyond the gunas, is\nspectator, is pure, partless, alone, subtle, owning naught, blemishless, immutable, devoid of sound,\ntouch, colour, taste, smell, is indubitable, non-grasping, omnipresent. He is unthinkable and invisible.\nHe purifies the impure, the unhallowed. He acts not. He is not subject to empirical existence.\nII-1. The good named the Atman is pure, one and non-dual always, in the form of Brahman. Brahman\nalone shines forth.\nII-2. Even as the world with its distinctions like affirmation, negation, etc., Brahman alone shines forth.\nII-3. With distinctions like teacher and disciples (also), Brahman alone appears. From the point of view\nof truth, pure Brahman alone is.\nII-4. Neither knowledge nor ignorance, neither the world nor aught else (is there).\nWhat sets empirical life afoot is the appearance of the world as real.\nII-5(a). What winds up empirical life is (its) appearance as unreal.\nII-5(b)-6. What discipline is required to know, \u2018this is a pot\u2019, except the adequacy of the means of right\nknowledge ? Once it is given, the knowledge of the object (supervenes). The ever present Self shines\nwhen the means of Its cognition (is present).\nII-7. Neither place nor time nor purity is required. The knowledge \u2018I am Devadatta\u2019 depends on nothing\nelse.\nII-8. Similarly, the knowledge \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 of the Knower of Brahman (is independent). Just as the\nwhole world by the sun, by the splendour of the Knowledge of Brahman is everything illumined.\nII-9-10(a). What can illumine the non-existent, and illusory, non-Self ? That which endows the Vedas,\nShastras, Puranas and all other beings with import \u2013 that Knower what will illumine ?\nII-10(b)-11. The child ignores hunger and bodily pain and plays with things. In the same way, the\nhappy Brahman-Knower delights (in himself) without the sense of \u2018mine\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019. Thus the silent sage,\nalive and alone, the embodiment of desirelessness, treats the objects of desire.\nII-12. Existing as the Self of all, he is ever content abiding in his Self. Free from all wealth, he rejoices\nalways: though companionless, he is mighty.\nII-13. Though not eating, he is ever content, peerless he looks on all alike: though acting, he does\nnothing: though partaking of fruit, yet, he is no experiencer thereof.\nII-14-17. Living in a body, he is still disembodied; though determinate, he is omnipresent; never is this\nBrahman-Knower, disembodied and ever existent, affected by the pleasant and the unpleasant or by the\ngood and the evil. Because it appears to be encompassed by Rahu (the darkness), the unencompassed\nsun is said to be encompassed by deluded men, not knowing the truth. Similarly, deluded folk behold\nthe best of Brahman-Knowers, liberated from the bondage of body, etc., as though he is embodied,\nsince he appears to have a body. The body of the liberated one remains like the shed Slough of the\nsnake.\nII-18. Moved a little, hither and thither, by the vital breath, (that body) is borne like a piece of timber,\nup and down, by the flood waters.\nII-19-20. By fate is the body borne into contexts of experiences at appropriate times. (On the contrary)\nhe who, giving up all migrations, both knowledge and unknowable, stays as the pure unqualified Self,\nis himself the manifest Shiva. He is the best of all Brahman-Knowers. In life itself the foremost\nBrahman-Knower is the ever free, he has accomplished his End.\nII-21. All adjuncts having perished, being Brahman he is assimilated to the non-dual Brahman, like a\nman who, with (appropriate) apparels, is an actor and without them (resumes his natural state),\nII-22(a). In the same way the best of Brahman-Knowers is always Brahman alone and none else.\nII-22(b)-23. Just as space becomes space itself when the (enclosing) pot perishes, so, when particular\ncognitions are dissolved, the Brahman-Knower himself becomes nothing but Brahman, as milk poured\ninto milk, oil into oil, and water into water become (milk, oil and water).\n\nII-24(a). Just as, combined, they become one, so does the Atman-knowing sage in the Atman.\nII-24(b). Thus disembodied liberation is the infinite status of Being.\nII-25. Having won the status of Brahman, no longer is the Yogin reborn, for his ignorance-born bodies\nhave all been consumed by the experimental knowledge of Being as the Self.\nII-26-27(a). Because that Yogin has become Brahman, how can Brahman be reborn ? Bondage and\nliberation, set up by Maya, are not real in themselves in relation to the Self, just as the appearance and\ndisappearance of the snake are not in relation to the stirless rope.\nII-27(b). Bondage and liberation may be described as real and unreal and as due to the nescience\n(concealment of truth).\nII-28-29. Brahman suffers from no concealment whatsoever. It is uncovered, there being nothing other\nthan It (to cover It). The ideas, \u2018it is\u2019 and \u2018it is not\u2019, as regards Reality, are only ideas in the intellect.\nThey do not pertain to the eternal Reality. So bondage and liberation are set up by Maya and do not\npertain to the Self.\nII-30. In the supreme Truth as in the sky, impartite, inactive, quiescent, flawless, unstained and nondual where is room for (mental) construction ?\nII-31. Neither suppression nor generation, neither the bond nor the striving: neither the liberty seeking\nnor the liberated \u2013 this is the metaphysical truth.\nOm!

Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nShiva, who is the Lord of all beings (Pasupathi), is always witness for everything. The minds of all\npeople are controlled as well as sent to different topics by Him only. The soul acts because of him. The\nwords talk because of Him. The eyes see shapes because of Him. The ear hears everything because of\nHim. Even other organs only perform the actions allotted to them because of Him. This act of His is not\ndue to the nature but by illusion. Whatever has been taught as \u201cWhat is heard?\u201d, to the beings, has been\ntaught so by Shiva who is Pasupathi and He gives the nature of \u201cWhat is heard?\u201d to them. He enters the\nminds of souls, sits there as its nature and gives it the position of the mind. He is different from all\nthings that are known to us through organs. Of all that knowledge taught to the different organs, He is\nthe one who is there taking suitable forms, and gives the being the relevant experience. Therefore eyes,\nspeech and other organs do not go to His great self-shining form. That shine of the soul, which is not\ndue to its action, is due to the soul itself and not the organs. Suppose we decide to do away with rules\nof logic, it can be told that he who understands Brahman himself becomes the great knower of\nBrahman.\nThis type of outside knowledge should be attained by truth, penance and other rules of life dictated by\n\ncelibacy and by the paths shown by Vedanta. People in whom there are no faults see realistic object of\nself shine in their own body. Others do not see it. By having a discipline in food habits, mental\ndiscipline develops. By mental discipline, one gets wisdom. Step by step. the problems in the mind are\nsolved. By the knowledge of the form of Brahman when the world becomes that which should be\nenjoyed, he eats the form which is he himself. There is nothing else except oneself. The savant who\nknows Brahman, whenever he sees the world does not see it as something different from himself. This\nis the Upanishad.\nOm !

Now then Saunaka, the great householder (mahashala) approached in due form the revered sage\nPippalada of Angiras family and asked him: (All created things) were surely present in the divine ether\nof the heart of Brahman (the Hiranyagarbha). How did the great lord create them out of himself in\ndifferent species and who is this great and powerful lore ? To him (Pippalada) said: The most excellent\nlore of Brahman which I now expound, (Brahman of that alone) is true. It shines brilliantly in the city\nof the transcendent Brahman, being beyond Rajas (and the other gunas), partless, pure, indestructible\nand sustaining the power of the senses and the vital airs. He is the creator of the group of bees (in the\nform of individual souls) and restrains (their outward vision). Remaining in the city of his Self, doing\nno worldly work (as an ascetic) (he realizes oneness with Brahman). (But) as a doer of action he reaps\nthe fruit (of repeated births and deaths), like a farmer. The knower of the true nature of action does\naction, (without attachment). Knowing the secret of action, (that unattached action leads to liberation)\n(the ascetic) shall do action. Which person (possessing discrimination) will throw the net (of motivated\naction) on the one (Brahman, screening it) ? (Motiveless action) will not drag him (to worldliness), will\nnot drag him.\n2. The deities presiding over the vital breath are four (Vishva, Viraj, Otir and Turya). All the nadis\n\n(where the vital breath and the deities remain are also four). (The former two active in Rama and\nArama get fatigued in the waking and dreaming states and rest during) deep sleep as a hawk flying in\nthe sky. Just as a hawk flying in the sky goes (when fatigued) into its abode, the nest, so the speaker\n(the Self) after remaining in this (waking) and the other (dreaming state, rests in deep sleep). This Self\n(while resting) in the golden transcendent sheath (of the ether of the heart) and being immortal is active\nin the three nadis (Rama, etc.,). (The first pada of this being avidya) it remains in the state of Brahman\nin the three quarters. The remaining pada (the Jiva) attains (its natural state) and then follows (i.e.\nattains liberation). Hence the speaker of elsewhere (the Jiva in the avidya) and the other (the Tripada\nBrahman are fancied to be different and thereby the Jiva wanders in bondage.\n(Although) the Jiva remains in the golden transcendent sheath (of the ether of the heart,\nyet it experiences the states of waking, etc., due to avidya). Just as Devadatta (i.e. any person)\nawakened from sleep when prodded with a stick does not go back (to sleep immediately, so also the\nJiva getting wisdom from the Vedanta does not have the delusion of the three states of waking, etc.,);\nand it is not tainted by good or bad acts (such as the optional) charitable deeds. It is similar to a small\nboy who experiences joy without specific desires (in whatever thing that comes to him). Just as the\nluminous being (Jiva), (after getting fatigued in the waking and dreaming states) welcomes the joy of\ndeep sleep, so it experiences bliss by realizing (its oneness with) the supreme effulgence (Brahman),\nwhich gives all round lustre to luminaries (such as the sun). Thus the heart (chitta) merges itself in the\nhighest (Brahman) and thus realizing the Paramatman enjoys bliss. The pure colour (i.e. the state of\nnon-distinction) arises from the (grace of) Ishvara. Again by the same path of turya-svapna (dreaming\nin the fourth state) he gives rest to the Self. Just as a leech moves from one position to another (the Jiva\nmoves from the waking state of the turya to the dreaming state of the turya); this desire (to move from\none state to another in the turya) arises due to (the grace of) Ishvara. By this the Jiva enjoys itself (by\nmeans of the distinctionful and distinctionless deep meditation, Savikalpa and Nirvikalpa Samadhi).\nThe juncture of the individual and supreme consciousness is rejected as there is a tinge of distinction\ninvolved in it. (When distinctionlessness alone exists) it is the highest (i.e. Brahman) and there is\nnothing other than that. (When Self-realization does not result by the study, etc., of the scripture) then\none shall resort to the eight-limbed Yoga; this like a flower of a plantain tree (ever rubbing against the\nstem and attaining the state of a blossom) succeeds (in attaining perfection). That which remains as the\nsource of Indra (Ishvara) is ever awake there, as the source of the Veda (as Parameshvara). Beyond (the\nbonds of) good and bad, he (the ascetic) is not tainted by (accidental) good or bad actions. This\neffulgent Being is the (bestower of) favour on other gods (like the god Brahma), the \u2018internal check\u2019 of\nthe form of unattached pure consciousness, the Purusha, the Hamsa of the Pranava, the supreme\nBrahman. It is not the chief Prana (vital breath). The Pranava is the Self (Jiva). (This state of the Jiva)\nremains as the first effulgent being. How can he who knows thus (the true nature of the Pranava) set\nforth difference (between the Jiva and Brahman) ? He realizes that the Jiva is Brahman (alone).\n3. Then to this realized person reality (i.e. true wisdom) constitutes the inner tuft and sacred thread. To\nthe Brahmana desirous of liberation is (allowed) the state of the inward tuft and sacred thread. The\nwearing of externally visible tuft and sacred thread (is necessary) for the householders engaged in\nrituals. The characteristic of the inward sacred thread is not clearly visible like external thread; it is the\nunion with reality inwardly.\n4. It (avidya) is not existent (as the cause is not visible), nor non-existent (as the effect is visible as the\nphenomenal world), nor both (existent and non-existent part, as the two are incompatible). It is not\ndifferent (from Brahman as it has no independent existence), nor non-different (as it is not a substance),\nnor of both (different and non-different, as it is an impossibility). It is not possessed of parts (as the\nparts are absent in the cause), nor partless (as the effect is seen possessed of parts), nor a combination\nof both. (Thus avidya is indescribable). It is to be discarded by the realization of oneness of Brahman\nand the Self; for it is the cause of illusion. Thus (it is to be understood).\n5. There is nothing other than Brahman of the five padas (i.e. the turyatita). There are four places for\n\nrealizing the inward Jiva-Brahman who consists of four padas inside the body. (The vyasti\u2019s four padas\nare: Vishva, Taijasa, Prajna and Turiya. The samasti\u2019s four padas are: Viraj, Sutra, Bija and Turiya). In\nthe eyes, throat, heart and head there are (the four) states of waking, dreaming, deep sleep and turya.\n(Moreover the Atman is to be conceived as) the Ahavaniya, Garhapatya, Dakshina and Sabhya fires. In\nthe waking state (the presiding deity is) the god Brahma, in dreaming state Vishnu, in deep sleep Rudra\nand the fourth state is the indestructible one, consisting of consciousness. Hence the four states\n(waking, etc.,) are to be considered as a covering by four fingers and just as the sacred thread is of\nninety-six four-finger breadths (in extent) so the inward brahma-sutra consists of ninety-six categories\n(tattvas). As the sacred thread consists of three threads so the inward brahma-sutra is brought to the\nstate of thirty two categories in each of the three gunas.\nThis state of the triad purified by wisdom is to be known separately as the three gods (Brahma, Vishnu\nand Shiva). This is known as the nine Brahman-s possessed of nine attributes. These counted as nine,\nbeing rendered into three each having three attributes, are to be identified with the digits of the sun,\nmoon and fire. The first and last (of the triad) are to be turned thrice in the middle and are to be\nconsidered as Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshvara. The first and last are to be joined and the knot of nonduality is to be made in the knot of consciousness. Then this which extends from the navel to the\nBrahmarandhra and connected with the twenty-seven tattvas separately and possessing the three gunas\nis to be considered as one though they are seen with the characteristics of the Trinity. This (inward)\nbrahma-sutra is to be considered as hanging from the left shoulder reaching up to the right hip. The\nmeeting together of the first and last is to be understood as having one foundation. Things made of clay\nare considered real (but) it is verbosity (born of ignorance); the transformation is a (mere) name; that it\nis clay alone is the truth. (As there is no pot without clay, so the primary cause, Brahman alone is real).\nWith the two letters of the Hamsa (i.e. I am the Hamsa, Brahman) he should be convinced of the\ninternal tuft and sacred thread. The state of a Brahmana is the state deserving meditation on Brahman.\nThe state of being a sage has the absence of visible tuft and sacred thread. Thus the householder has\nvisible tuft for performing ritual and the sacred thread for acquiring wisdom. To the state of the\nsemblance of a Brahmana there is the tuft consisting of a mass of hair and sacred thread made of cotton\nthreads. (The brahma-sutra is one alone); it is four (as Vishva, Viraj, etc.,) by quadruplication. The\ntwenty-four tattvas constitute the threads. The nine tattvas constitute the one transcendent Brahman,\n(but people) provide many paths (such as Sankhya, Yoga, etc.,) due to difference in approach.\nLiberation is one alone to all, whether they are Brahma and the other gods, divine sages or human\nbeings. Brahman is one alone. The state of the Brahmana is one alone. Castes, stages of life and special\nduties are divergent. The tuft is the same to the castes and stages of life. To the ascetic seeking\nsalvation the basis of tuft and sacred thread, (the wise) declare, is the Pranava alone. The Hamsa is the\ntuft, the Pranava is the sacred thread and the Nada is the connecting link. This is the dharma and no\nother is the dharma. How is that ? The Pranava, Hamsa and Nada constitute the three fold thread and\nthis remains in consciousness in one\u2019s heart. Know this to be the three fold Brahman. (The ascetic)\nshall discard the worldly tuft and sacred thread.\n6. Having had a shave removing the tuft, a wise person shall discard the external sacred thread. He\nshall have as the sacred thread the transcendent Brahman which is indestructible.\n7. For avoiding rebirth he shall ever long for liberation. The sutra is so called as it indicates (liberation);\nthe sutra indeed is the highest position.\n8. He knows the sutra who has become a seeker after liberation, a mendicant monk. He is the knower of\nthe Veda, having unimpeachable conduct. He is the learned Brahmana who sanctifies by his presence\nthe persons who sit in the same row to dine with him.\n9. The Yogin, who is the knower of Yoga, a Brahmana and an ascetic shall wear that sutra by which all\nthis (phenomenal world) is joined together (as a unity) just as gems are strung together in a thread.\n10. A learned Brahmana who is deeply intent on Yoga and spiritual wisdom shall discard the external\nsacred thread. He who wears the sutra consisting of devotion to Brahman attains salvation. There is\n\nneither impurity nor the state of eating the leavings of others when one possesses that sutra.\n11. Those who, having the sacred thread of spiritual wisdom, possess the sutra inwardly are the\nknowers of the sutra in the world and they are the (true) wearers of the sacred thread.\n12. Their tuft and sacred thread consist of spiritual wisdom (Jnana), they are established in Jnana; to\nthem Jnana alone is supreme and this Jnana is declared to be sanctifying.\n13. The wise one whose tuft consists of Jnana and no other, like the flame emanating from fire, is said\nto possess the (true) tuft; not the others who wear (a mass of) hair.\n14. Those who are immersed in activities, whether Vedic (ritual) or worldly actions live as Brahmanas\nin name only, filling their bellies. They come to grief and have rebirth again and again.\n15. The sacred thread hanging from the left shoulder to the right hip is contrariwise (to liberation). The\nwise shall wear (i.e. possess) true knowledge which is rooted in consciousness, having threads in the\nform of true principles (tattvas) and extending from the navel to the tip of the aperture in the crown of\nthe head (Brahmarandhra).\n16. This sacred thread which forms part of ritual and made of (cotton) threads is to be worn by them\n(i.e. the ignorant). He whose tuft consists of wisdom as also his sacred thread has all the (true)\ncharacteristics of a Brahmana; others have none at all.\n17. It is this sacred thread which is the supreme panacea. The wise one who wears this sacred thread\nattains liberation.\n18. That learned Brahmana is entitled to renunciation who has the sacred thread both within and\nwithout; but the one having one (i.e. the external one) alone is never entitled to renunciation.\n19. Hence by all effort the ascetic shall long for liberation. Discarding the external thread he shall wear\nthe internal sutra within himself.\n20. Disregarding the external phenomenal world, tuft and sacred thread he shall hold on to the tuft and\nsacred thread in the form of the sacred syllable (Pranava) and Brahman (Hamsa) and thus equip himself\nfor liberation. Thus declared the revered sage Saunaka. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Parabrahmopanishad, included in the Atharva-Veda.",
    "Avadhutaka": "\nAvadhuta Upanishad\nTranslated by Prof. A. A. Ramanathan\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. Then, it is said, Samkriti approached the venerable Avadhuta, Dattatreya, and questioned: Venerable\nSir, Who is an Avadhuta ? What is his condition ? What his characteristic ? And what his worldly\nexistence ? To him replied the venerable Dattatreya, the most compassionate:\n2. The Avadhuta is so called because he is immortal [akshara]; he is the greatest [varenya]; he has\ndiscarded worldly ties [dhutasamsarabandhana]; and he is the indicated meaning of the sentence 'Thou\nart That', etc., [tattvamasyadi-lakshya].\n3. He who rests constantly in himself, after crossing (the barrier of) castes and stages (of social\nposition) and thus rises above varnas and asramas and is in union (with God) is said to be an Avadhuta.\n4. His joy [priya] is (to be envisaged as) the head; delight [moda] is his right wing; great delight\n[pramoda] his left wing; and bliss (his very self). Thus he assumes a fourfold condition.\n5. One should identify Brahman neither with the head nor with the middle part nor with the bottom but\nwith (what remains in the shape of) the tail, since it is said that Brahman is \u2018the Tail\u2019 and substratum.\nThus, those who contemplate this fourfold division attain the supreme Goal.\n6. Not by rituals, not by begetting children, not by wealth, but by renunciation [tyaga] alone a few\nattained immortality.\n7. His (the Avadhuta\u2019s) worldly existence consists in moving about freely, with or without clothes. For\nthem there is nothing righteous or unrighteous; nothing holy or unholy. Through all-consuming, correct\nknowledge [samgrahaneshti] (the Avadhuta) performs Ashvamedha sacrifice within (himself). That is\nthe greatest sacrifice and the great Yoga.\n\n8. Nought of this extraordinary, free action (of his) should be disclosed. This is the great vow\n[mahavrata]. He is not tainted like the ignorant.\n9. As the sun absorbs all waters, and the fire consumes all things (remaining unaffected by them), even\nso, the pure Yogin enjoys all objects, unstained by virtues or sins.\n10. As the ocean into which all waters flow maintains its own nature despite the water pouring in (from\nall sides), so, he alone attains peace into whom all desires flow in like manner; not he who seeks the\nobjects of pleasure.\n11. There is neither death nor birth; none is bound, none aspires. There is neither seeker after liberation\nnor any liberated; this indeed is the ultimate Truth.\n12. Many were my activities perchance in the past for gaining things here and hereafter, or for\nobtaining liberation. All that is now of the past.\n13. That itself is the state of contentment. Verily remembering the same (i.e. the past) achievements\ninvolving objects, he now remains thus ever content. The miserable ignorant, desirous of children, etc.,\nneeds must suffer.\n14. Wherefore shall I suffer, who am filled with supreme bliss ? Let those who yearn to go to the other\nworlds perform rituals.\n15. What shall I, who am of the nature of all the worlds, perform ? For what and how ? Let those who\nare worlds, perform ? For what and how ? Let those who are qualified interpret the Shastras or teach\nthe Vedas.\n16. I have no such qualification, since I am free of action. I have no desire for sleeping or begging,\nbathing or cleaning. Nor do I do them.\n17. If onlookers thus superimpose, let them do so. What matters to me the superimposition of others ?\nA heap of the red-black berries (of the Abrus precatorius) would not burn, even if others superimposed\nfire on it. Likewise, I partake not of worldly duties superimposed (on me) by others.\n18. Let them, who are ignorant of the reality, study the scriptures; knowing (the reality) why should I\nstudy ? Let them who have doubts reflect (upon what was studied). Having no doubts, I do not reflect.\n19. Were I under illusion, I may meditate; having no illusion, what meditation can there be (for me) ?\nConfusion of body for the self, I never experience.\n20. The habitual usage \u2018I am a man\u2019 is possible even without this confusion, for it is due to impressions\naccumulated during a long time.\n21. When the results of actions set in motion [prarabdha-karman] are exhausted, the habitual usage also\nends. This (worldly usage) will not cease even with repeated meditation unless such actions are\nexhausted.\n22. If infrequency of worldly dealings is sought, let there be contemplation for you. Wherefore should\nI, to whom worldly dealings offer no hindrance, contemplate ?\n23. Because I do not have distractions, I do not need concentration, distraction or concentration being\nof the mind that modifies.\n24. What separate experience can there be for me, whom am of the nature of eternal experience ? What\nhas to be done is done, what has to be gained is gained for ever.\n25. Let my dealings, worldly, scriptural or of other kinds proceed as they have started, I being neither\nan agent (of action) nor one affected (by it).\n26. Or, even though I have achieved what has to be achieved, let me remain on the scriptural path for\nthe sake of the well-being of the world. What harm for me thereby?\n27. Let the body be engaged in the worship of gods, bathing, cleaning, begging and so forth. Let speech\nrepeatedly utter the tara-mantra or recite the Upanishadic passages.\n28. Let thought contemplate Vishnu or let it be dissolved in the bliss of Brahman. I am the witness. I\nneither do nor cause any doing.\n29. Being contented with duties fulfilled and achievements accomplished, he ceaselessly reflects as\nfollows with a contented mind:\n\n30. Blessed am I, blessed am I. Directly and always, I experience my own self. Blessed am I, blessed\nam I, the bliss of Brahman shines brightly in me.\n31. Blessed am I, blessed am I. I do not see the misery of existence. Blessed am I, blessed am I; my\nignorance has fled away.\n32. Blessed am I, blessed am I; no duty exists for me. Blessed am I, blessed am I; everything to be\nobtained is now obtained.\n33. Blessed am I, blessed am I. What comparison is there in the world for my contentment ! Blessed am\nI, blessed am I; blessed, blessed, again and again blessed.\n34. Logical ! The virtues accrued have yielded fruit ! Indeed they have ! By the richness of virtue we\nare as we are.\n35. Wondrous knowledge, wondrous knowledge ! Wondrous happiness, wondrous happiness !\nWondrous scriptures, wondrous scriptures ! Wondrous teachers, wondrous teachers !\n36. He who studies this also achieves everything to be achieved. He becomes free of the sins of\ndrinking liquor. He becomes free of the sins of stealing gold. He becomes free of the sins of killing a\nBrahmin. He becomes free of actions, ordained or prohibited. Knowing this, let him wander according\nto his free will. Om, Truth. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Avadhuta Upanishad belonging to the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Tripuratapini": "\nTripura Tapini Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! Gods ! With ears let us hear what is good;\nAdorable ones ! With eyes let us see what is good.\nWith steady limbs, with bodies, praising,\nLet us enjoy the life allotted by the gods.\nMay Indra, of wide renown, grant us well-being;\nMay Pusan, and all-gods, grant us well-being.\nMay Tarksya, of unhampered movement, grant us well-being.\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nI-1: Now, in this sphere (of nescience), the Lord (Sadasiva), assuming the guises of Prajapati, Vishnu\nand Rudra, comes to be styled Goddess Tripura. By His primeval Power are fashioned the three abodes\n\u2013 the earth, the atmosphere and the heavens, or the heavens, the earth and the nether world. In the form\nof hrim, identical with the maya of Hara, the divine Hrillekha permeates, with Her terrible might, the\nterminus of the three peaks (above the junction of the two eyebrows), the seat of equilibrium of the\nthree gunas, and the region where the world of objects is dissolved. This selfsame divinity is called\nTripura.\nI-2: On that adorable splendour\nOf the divine Creator we\nMeditate; may He our thoughts inspire \u2013\nWho beyond all darkness is, Om.\nI-3: Let us for all-knowing Fire the soma press\nWho, of our foes, the wealth consumes;\nAs boat over river, so may He help\nUs over all difficulties, all troubles.\nI-4: Let us adore with sacrifice the three-eyed God,\nFragrant increaser of earthly growth.\n\nLike cucumber fruit from its stalk released,\nLet me from death, find freedom unto immortality.\nI-5: The supreme sovereign, the goddess of the three cities, is the embodiment of the three Vedas and\nthe supreme knowledge consisting of the 108 letters. The first four divisions elucidate Brahman; the\nsecond pertains to Sakti or Power; and the third to Siva, the Good.\nI-6: It is recorded that the worlds, the Vedas, the sciences, legends, codes, medical works and\nastronomical treatises have all proceeded from the union of Siva and Sakti (Goodness and Power).\nI-7: Now we shall elucidate the supreme mystery of it (i.e. the mantra given above). The syllable tat of\nthe great mantra is the eternal Brahman, the supreme Lord, indefinable, impeccable, unconditioned, and\nunconstrained. He thinks, perceives, evolves, desires the status of consciousness. Thus that sole Deity,\nessentially good, evolves as the visible world. In the ascetics, sacrifices, mystics, He desires and what\nis desired is born. Being free from desires (in truth) and impeccable, He holds sway. He puts forth\n(letters like) a, ka, ca, ta, ta, pa, ya and sa. Hence is the Lord named Desire. So, technically, (the Lord\nas) Desire pervades ka. Desire alone is this tat. Thus is karma understood. Hence it is the sense of tat.\nWhoso knows thus (becomes the Lord).\nI-8: Savitur varenyam. The root supreme means \u2018to give birth to a living thing\u2019. Savitur gives birth to\nliving things; power gives birth.\nI-9: This primeval power is Tripura,\nThe supreme sovereign, Tripura;\nGoddess great with ear-rings adorned\nIn sphere of fire abiding.\nI-10: Whosoever masters (this knowledge) pervades everything. The power of the triangle (the serpent\npower) creates with (the aid of the) exalted letter e. So only the letter e is taken.\nI-11: Varenyam means the best, the adorable, the imperishable, worthy of obeisance. So varenyam is\nunderstood as the letter e. Whoso knows this (becomes the best).\nI-12: Bhargo devasya dhimahi \u2013 this we shall expound: Dha denotes bearing. By thought is the\nsupreme Lord borne. Bharga is the shining one that dwells in the centre; the imperishable fourth\n(letter), the immediate Fourth, the all, the inmost of everything. The fourth letter i is in the middle of\nwords. Thus is the form of bharga expounded, they say. So the letter i is understood as the equivalent of\nbhargo devasya dhi.\nI-13: The exposition of mahi. The letter in which are present greatness, inertness and hardness is mahi.\nThe letter la is the supreme abode. The letter la denotes the sphere, predominantly hard, comprising the\nseas, the mountains, the seven islands and the forests, and having a resplendent form. By mahi the\ngoddess Earth is denoted.\nI-14: Dhiyo yo nah prachodayat. May the supreme Self, the primeval, transcendental Sadasiva, inspire\n(our) thoughts, (our) luminous Self, with the steadfast letter la towards the transcendental,\nundifferentiated Real, which is beyond the sphere of desire for contemplation. Without verbal\nutterance, holding this in mind only, should one meditate.\nI-15: Paro rajase savadom. Finally that (which is other than the Self) becomes the supreme Light, pure\nconsciousness, the divinity dwelling in the heart, whose mark is consciousness, and which is (the same\nas) hrim, whose abode is the heart. So the group of five letters, Vagbhavakuta, which gives rise to the\nfive elements and consists of five sections, is clarified. Who knows thus (reaps the results).\nI-16: Now the next group that has become Kamakala is called Kamakuta, say the wise. In the utterance\nof the thirty-two sacred syllables, tat savitur varenyam, etc., tat is the supreme Self, Sadasiva, the\nimperishable, the pure, the unconditioned. The syllable ha, setting forth the identity (with Siva), has the\nform of Siva; it is held to be unarticulated, (though) a syllable. Thus, remaining external, it (ha)\nindicates the Power.\nI-17: Along the line indicated earlier of tat savituh the moon (whose seed-syllable is sa) must be placed\nnext to the sun (whose seed-syllable is ha). (The light of the sun) fills the region between the basic\n\ncircle and the sacred orifice of the crown. The syllable sa is said to be unique. (He who is meditated on\nas tat and savitur) is the divine being whose essence is Siva and Sakti.\nI-18: Siva is the Supreme God\nSo (Brahman-knowers) say;\nSakti is all that is born;\nSun and moon united are\nHamsa \u2013 Brahman attributeless.\nI-19: From Siva supreme, who creates\nDesire\u2019s objects, wells up desire;\nLord of desires, the choice Light\nIs described as the letter ka.\nI-20: Tat Savitur varenyam Bhargo devah. The imperishable milk that wipes out the effects of acts and\ntheir agents is worth imbibing. That imperishable (milk) is won through the union of the supreme Self\nand the individual self. That is the clear third syllable ha. It is indeed Sadasiva, the flawless, the shining\ndivinity. The last syllable is thus expounded as the supreme abode.\nI-21: Dhi denotes upholding; the upholding of inert matter is associated with mahi, denoted by the\nsyllable, la. The sense of la coming after ha denoting Siva is clearly (Brahman). The last syllable is the\nSupreme Spirit. May it inspire our thoughts !\nI-22: Paro rajase savadom: This group is the abode of Kamakala (i.e. the Vagbhava group). He who\ntreads the six paths (such as the path of letters) reaches the seat of Vishnu. Whoso knows thus (reaches\nthat seat). Nothing besides this (exists), says the Lord.\nI-23: After this the other, the third group, Saktikuta, attains (accord) with the Gayatri of thirty-two\nsyllables.\nI-24: Tat Savitur varenyam. From the Self (comes) the sky; from the sky the air stirs forth. What comes\ninto being in dependence on It is adorable. Befitting Savitur is the coming together of the individual\nself and the Supreme Self. The syllable denoting the individual self, (sa), clearly attains the form of the\nluminous Power.\nI-25: Bhargo devasya dhi. With these words is counted the syllable (ka) denoting Siva who contains\n(all). With mahi, etc. (la is in accord). With the desirable, lovely, visible remainder (i.e. dhiyo yo nah,\netc.), the desirable, lovely (hrillekha is in accord). Thus is Saktikuta elucidated.\nI-26: Whoso repeats thus the fifteen-syllabled mantra of Tripura attains all desires; he attains all\nenjoyments; he conquers all worlds; he causes all words to bloom; he attains the status of Rudra;\nbreaking through the abode of Vishnu (the veil of Maya), he reaches the supreme Brahman.\nI-27: Having set forth the primeval vidya (incantation), the Sakti group (sa ka la hrim) and Power and\nSiva (denoted by sa ka) (must be contemplated in the first abode, the wakeful state). The Lopamudra\nincantation (ha sa ka la hrim) (must be contemplated) in the second abode, (the dream state).\nI-28: In the third abode (or the collective sleep state) must be contemplated the previous incantation,\nthe Power, hrillekha, without the nasal sound (sa ka la hri), the incantation on which Durvasas, the\nwrathful sage, meditated.\nI-29: The Vagbhava group of the previous incantation is described as pertaining to Manu, Chandra and\nKubera.\nI-30: After Madana (or klim) comes the auspicious Vagbhava; next is the Kamakala (ka, etc.); next is\nthe Sakti group, sa, etc. This grouping, in this order, was adored by Manu, and must be contemplated in\nthe fourth abode (the Visva state).\nI-31: (First) that which is styled Siva and Sakti (namely ha, etc.); then Vagbhava; again the Siva and\nSakti group; and the third (sa, etc.) \u2013 this incantation, adored of Chandra, is to be contemplated in the\nfifth abode (the Taijasa state).\nI-32: The incantation of Siva, etc., added to that of Chandra is the incantation of Kubera; it must be\ncontemplated in the sixth abode (the Prajna state). Whoso knows this (attains Kubera\u2019s wealth).\n\nI-33: Leaving out the fourth vowel i, and placing the sun and the moon (represented by ha and sa) in\nthe beginning of all (groups), there results the vidya (incantation) promoting power over desires; it is\nnamed after Agastya and must be meditated on in the seventh abode (the Viraj state).\nI-34: In the incantation (of Agastya) given above, set in twofold manner, ha ha, representing the\nincantations beginning with Kama and Madana; then sa, the seed-syllable of Sakti, and ka, the\nbeginning of Vagbhava. Of sa and ka, let the vowels be shortened into half-syllables. This is the\nincantation of Nandi (to be contemplates) in the eighth abode (the Sutratman state).\nI-35: The Vagbhava group; the incantation of Agastya, consisting of words and meanings styled\nKamakala; (then) all the power of Maya (the Sakti group) \u2013 (these, integrated, were adored by the sun\nand so) this is called the incantation of Prabhakara. (It must be meditated on) in the mind abode (the\nstate of the causal abode).\nI-36: Again the incantation of Agastya; (then) Vagbhava; the seed-letter of Sakti (hrim); the seed-letter\nof Kama (klim); the seed-letters of Siva and Sakti (hamsa); (again) the seed-letter of Kama (klim); the\nseed-letter of the earth (lam); that of Maya (hrim); the abode of Kamakala (the six syllables beginning\nwith ha); the seed-letters of the moon and the sun (so\u2019ham); the seed-letter of Kama (klim); that of Siva\n(ham); that of Mahiman (sa); the third (i.e. hamsa, so\u2019ham and hamsa) \u2013 (integrated), this incantation,\nadored by Shanmukha must be meditated on in the tenth abode.\nI-37: Repeating the incantation of Agastya after that of Shanmukha, one gets the incantation of the\nsupreme Siva who rules over the last region. It must be meditated on in the eleventh abode (in the spirit\nof Anujnatir).\nI-38: Repeating the incantation of Agastya with Vagbhava, the incantation of Kubera, the abode of\nKamakala and the sovereign group of Sakti derived from the incantation of Lopamudra, one gets the\nincantation of Vishnu. It must be meditated on in the twelfth abode (in the spirit of pure Anujna). He\nwho knows thus (becomes Vishnu).\nI-39: The Lord (Sadasiva) said to all the gods: Having listened to the incantation (set forth by Me) and\nmade it clear to yourself (\u2018I am Brahman\u2019), know (there is nothing other than Brahman) and reduce\n(whatever appears besides) to Brahman. Enthrone the supreme vidya, the Divinity in the heart \u2013 the\nDivinity styled Kama, the Primeval One; whose form is the Fourth; who transcends the Fourth, who\nexceeds all; who occupies all seats consecrated with holy spells; who is surrounded on all sides by\ndeities seated on the main and subordinate seats; who pervades all parts (from Prana, vital breath, to\nnaman, name); the deity who is replete with delight; who is in union with the supreme Spirit; who is in\nthe heart; whose gift is immortality; who is complete and who is possessed of senses; who, forever, is\nuprisen; who comprises three groups; has three abodes, and is the supreme and most excellent Maya;\nwho is the supreme power of Vishnu. Enthrone in the pericarp of the heart\u2019s lotus the supreme, sacred\nLakshmi, the Maya ever uprisen; who controls the senses of Her devotees; who overwhelms the god of\nlove; who is armed with bow and arrow; who inspires eloquence; who abides in the centre of the\nmoon\u2019s sphere, is adorned with the crescent, and assumes the guise of the seventeen Prajapatis. She is\nthe great one, eternally present. Her hands holding a noose and a goad are charming. She, the threeeyed one, shines like the rising sun. In the heart meditate on the goddess Mahalakshmi, comprehending\nall glories and possessed of all auspicious marks. Her own nature is Spirit. She is flawless. Her name is\nTrikuta. She has a smiling face, is beautiful, is the great Maya, and is extremely fascinating. She is\nadorned with great ear-rings. She rests on the threefold seat and abides in the nameless sacred abode,\nSripitha. She is the great Bhairavi, the power of Spirit, the great Tripura. Meditate on Her through the\ngreat yoga of meditation. Whoso knows Her thus (fulfils his life). This is the great Upanishad.\nII-1: Then, therefore, having uttered the verse, \u2018Let us for all-knowing Fire the soma press\u2019, etc., one\nachieves the realization of Tripura.\nII-2: The seers said: Explain the form of the extensive seed-letters latent in the beginning, middle and\nend of the glorificatory verse, \u2018Let us for all-knowing fire\u2026\u2019\n\nII-3: The Lord said to them: Utter the verse, \u2018Let us for all-knowing Fire the soma press\u2019, etc. Repeat\nbackwards the last group of the Adividya (i.e. sa ka la hrim). Lengthen the first syllable of the first\ngroup (as ka) and that of the second group (as ha). (Together we get ka ha). \u2018Let us press the soma\u2019.\nThey say that (this verse refers to the state in which) cosmic ignorance vanishes; it is competent (to\nextinguish all that has been imagined as other than Brahman); it is the most excellent and blissful; it is\nthe great glory.\nII-4: The first group (called Vagbhava), the same as all prosperity, causes the sublation (of the world of\nobjects); the second group (named after Kama) supports (the world of objects); the third (named after\nSakti) brings it into being. Thus meditating on the three groups and purifying the mind, and elucidating\nthe incantation of Tripura, one utters the mantra \u2018Let us for all-knowing Fire the soma press\u2019, etc.; then\n(there dawns) the wisdom called the incantation of Mahavidyeshvari.\nII-5: (Relying on) the incantation of Tripureshvari, having uttered the word jatavedase [\u2018for allknowing Fire\u2019] and associating the dot denoting the divine principle of Siva with the vowels a, etc., of\nthe Pranava, one gets the serpent-power that has become one with immortality and has assumed the\ntriangular form (at the base of the spinal column).\nII-6: Thus, of the chief principle of Adividya, the first group (beginning with ka) is Vagbhava; the\nsecond (beginning with ha) is the Kamakala. With the utterance of the syllables jata, the supreme Self\nis clearly expressed.\nII-7: By the syllables jata, etc., the supreme (undifferentiated) Self, Siva, is denoted.\nII-8: From birth onwards given to desires, one desires (Lordship). (When desires are renounced)\nperfection (of one\u2019s nature results). (So the knowers of Brahman) declare.\nII-9: That very thing (the perfect spirit of Siva), we declare aright as installed in the three la-s, the seedletters of the earth. Clarifying the letters of the mantras in the light of the significance of the three la-s\n(which denote existence-knowledge-bliss absolute), each in the midst (of the three groups), the word\ngotra must be understood. The principle of Siva is said to have been installed in this gotra. Thus has it\nbeen elucidated. Then follows the Kamakala (the second group beginning with ha). The rest may be\nelucidated as before with reference to vamam (competent). The incantation thus explained is styled\nSarvarakshakari, the All-protecting one.\nII-10: Thus having clarified this incantation of Tripureshi by means of the verse jatavedase, etc., there\nremains but the one supreme Divinity, the Light. Or (this results from) the incantation (consisting of the\nthree groups). Grant the boon of the Fourth (i.e. meditate on the fact that the three groups do not exist\nindependently of Siva). Fully identify the \u2018I\u2019 - sense with the nature of the Lord. Relate each of the\nthree groups with the incantation styled the All-protecting one. Also clarify the incantation of the\nAtmasana form. Repeat the verse jatavedase, etc., and (once more) recall to mind the All-protecting\nincantation. Assign the form of Siva and Sakti to the initial and final positions (of the All-protecting\nincantation). Know that the syllable sa in the verse jatavedase, etc., has Sakti as its quintessence and\nthat the word soma represents the prowess whose quintessence is Siva. Whoso knows this becomes\ngreat.\nII-11: Thus elucidate this incantation which abides in Tripura and which is set forth in the circular seat.\nRepeat the verse jatavedase, etc., and also the incantation of Tripureshvari which is ever ascendant and\nwhose quintessence is Siva and Sakti, as already set forth. Jatavedas symbolizes Siva, and sa has the\nimperishable Sakti as its essence. Elucidate Tripura, the ever-ascendant Mahalakshmi, resting on the\nseat of mantras (symbolized by ha and sa), denoting the sun and the moon, pervading the three groups\nand subsisting in between Siva and the primeval Power. Repeat the verse jatavedase sunavama somam,\netc., and call to mind the previous incantation associated with the seat of the real Self. With the words\nveda, etc., (in the verse), essentially the same as the sun denoted by ha, is indicated the universal Power\nof the Spirit (cicchakti) ever-ascendant. Put over it the dot (denoting the Siva principle). Elucidate the\nincantation of Tripura, garlanded, abiding in the seat of the Adept. Repeat the verse jatavedase\nsunavama somam, etc. Relying on the enchanting Tripura, contemplate (Her) in the syllables ka la.\n\nElucidate the embodied incantation of Tripura, the sovereign over all incantations. Repeat jatavedase,\netc., and relying on Tripura, the Lakshmi, one consumes fire.\nII-12: Elucidate the incantation of Tripura, the Mother, the sovereign threefold Light, knowing that she\nconsumes with a mouth of fire.\nII-13: Thus with the words sa mah parsad ati durgani visva, She illuminates the supreme, She who is\nthe inner Self. Her incantation, here, having become an effect, is utilized in the act of hailing. She is\ndeemed competent in every way.\nII-14: Thus these eight incantations, the very limbs of the divine Mahamaya are elucidated.\nII-15: The gods verily said to the blessed Lord: Tell us about the foremost of the wheels, which\npromotes all desires, is adored of all, takes all forms, faces all quarters, and is the gateway to\nLiberation, by adoring which the Yogins cut through (the knot of differences) into the undifferenced\nbliss of supreme Brahman.\nII-16: To them the blessed Lord said: We shall elucidate the concept of Srichakra.\nII-17: Make a triangle with three vertices. In it take as a measure a line, lengthen it, and make a triangle\nfarther in front of it. Parallel to the base of the first triangle, but over all, make another triangle. The\nfirst triangle is the wheel, the second is the intermediary region, and the third has, marking it, the eight\ntriangles.\nII-18: Then, moving the line beyond the intermediary quarters, on the extremities of the eight spoked\nwheel move the line for soliciting the Sadhyas etc. Have the upper part marked with triangles. Draw\nfour lines going up from the closed regions. In due order, with the two measuring lines, the wheel\ncomes to be marked with ten triangles.\nII-19: In the same manner, again, the wheel with ten spokes takes shape.\nII-20: The wheel with fourteen spokes takes shape by joining the measuring line brought up to the parts\nof the ten spokes, after having joined the four vertices of the central triangles with the triangles at the\nextremities of the four lines.\nII-21: Then take shape respectively the wheels enveloped in the eight lotuses, the sixteen lotuses, and\nthe earth-wheel with four gates.\nII-22: Thus has the wheel been elucidated by the process of construction.\nII-23: I enumerate in the reverse order (the elements of) the wheel consisting of the nine selves. The\nfirst wheel enchants the three worlds; has the eight powers such as the power to assume the atomic size\netc.; has the eight mothers; has the decade beginning with the All-agitating force; etc.; is manifest, is\noccupied by Tripura, and is characterized by the mystic mark of the All-agitating force.\nII-24: The second wheel fulfils all expectations, is conjoined with the sixteen attractive powers\nbeginning with sakama. It is well protected, occupied by the sovereign Tripura, and is characterized by\nthe mystic mark of the All-scattering force.\nII-25: The third wheel agitates all and is adorned with the eight flowers of Cupid. It is better secured,\noccupied by the beautiful Tripura, and characterized by the mystic mark of the All-fascinating force.\nII-26: The fourth wheel grants excellence to all; has fourteen forces like the All-agitating force; is\nassociated with a tradition; is occupied by the Dweller in the three cities, and is marked by the mystic\nmark of the All-subduing force.\nII-27: The fifth wheel, beyond the fourth, accomplishes all ends; has the ten forces such as the power to\nyield all perfections; has the fullness of the Kaula; is occupied by Mahalakshmi who is Tripura, and is\nmarked by the mystic mark of the greatly exciting force.\nII-28: The sixth wheel protects all; has ten traits such as omniscience; is devoid of interspaces; is\noccupied by the garlanded Tripura; and has the mark of the great goad.\nII-29: The seventh wheel cures all diseases; has eight forces such as the force to subdue; has its\nmysteries; and bears the mystic mark of the khechari.\nII-30: The eighth wheel grants all perfections; is characterized by four weapons, and the mysteries,\nhigher and lower. It is occupied by the mother, Tripura, and has the mystic mark of the seed.\n\nII-31: The ninth master-wheel is replete with all delight and is associated with the triad such as\nKameshvari. It is exceedingly mysterious, occupied by the great Tripura, the beautiful, and has the\nmystic mark of the triangle.\nII-32: All the metres indeed have passed over as spokes into the wheel. This wheel is the Srichakra.\nII-33: In its hub, in the sphere of fire, are the sun and the moon. Worship the seat of the syllable Om\nthere. There is the Imperishable in the form of the point. Call to mind the supreme Incantation, skylike, and immanent in it. Bring thither the great Tripura, the beautiful. Petition Her with the single\nverse:\nGoddess ! In milk bathed, with sandal paste\nBesmeared ! Goddess! With bilva leaves worshipped !\nDurga ! I seek refuge in Thee.\nAdore Her with the mantra of Mayalakshmi. Thus spoke the blessed Lord.\nII-34: With these mantras adore the blessed Goddess. Then She becomes pleased and manifests Herself.\nSo whoever worships with these mantras sees Brahman. He sees all things and achieves immortality \u2013\nwhosoever knows thus. This is the great Upanishad.\nIII-1: The gods said to the blessed Lord: We would fashion the mystic marks. The blessed Lord told\nthem: Seated in the lotus posture with the region of the knees touching the earth, make the mystic\nmarks.\nIII-2: He who knows the mystic mark of the triangle attracts all; he knows all; enjoys all fruits; he\nbreaks up all and immobilizes the foe. Keeping the middle fingers over the ring fingers, he (brings\ntogether) the little fingers and the thumbs, the forefingers being left free like rods pointing downward.\nThus is the first mark made (the triangle).\nIII-3: The same with the middle fingers joined is the second (the seed).\nIII-4: The third has the shape of the goad.\nIII-5: Rubbing the palms in the reverse order, bringing together the thumbs and the forefingers, the\nfourth is formed (the great goad).\nIII-6: The fifth (the great Deluder) is made when the thumbs are joined to the nails of the middle\nfingers, after rubbing with the forefinger on the little finger and the ring fingers held straight with the\nmiddle fingers.\nIII-7: The same shaped at the tip like a goad is the sixth (the All-subduing).\nIII-8: Keeping the left hand in the right resting posture, the ring fingers in the middle of the little\nfingers, and the middle fingers with the forefingers crossed over them, the thumbs straight, one gets the\nseventh, the khechari (the All-attracting).\nIII-9: In the all-upright, all-retracting posture, keeping each little finger in the space between its middle\nfinger and the ring finger, and at the sides the forefingers in the shape of the goad, and the thumbs and\npalms in contact, the eighth is formed (the All-scattering).\nIII-10: The ring fingers rest on the back of the middle fingers; the thumbs holding the middle fingers on\nwhich rest the forefingers remain in the middle \u2013 thus is the ninth formed (the All-agitating).\nIII-11: Keeping the little fingers equally in and the thumbs, too, equally in, the mystic mark comes to\nhave three sections. The five arrows, the mystic marks such as the five, are clear.\nIII-12: Krom is the seed of the goad; (ha, sa are those of Siva and Sakti; kha, of killing; prem, of\nenchantment); ha, sa, kha, prem, of khechari; ha (of the sun); straum (of desire); (ka) the first seed of\nVagbhava is the ninth. (Ha, the first seed of Kamakuta) is the tenth. Whoso knows thus (becomes an\nadept in mantra).\nIII-13: Now, therefore, we shall expound the wheel that has become the Kamakala. Hrim, klim, aim,\nblum, straum \u2013 these five desires pervade the whole wheel. Wrap up the middle desire, aim, in the past\n(desire), straum, (i.e. aim, straum, aim). Let this group be put within blum. Bind up twice the end\nsought with the two medial aim-s and worship (setting them) in the birch-bark. Whoso knows this\n\nwheel knows all; he attracts all the worlds; he immobilizes everything. The wheel dyed in indigo slays\nfoes, arrests all movements. Smearing it with lac, one controls all worlds. Uttering the formula nine\nlakhs of times, one attains the status of Rudra. Wrapping up (the wheel) in the inscribed diagram, one\nbecomes victorious. Offering oblation in the fire built in a triangular fire-place, one wins over women.\nDoing so in a fire-place shaped like a rod or a circle one acquires unrivalled wealth. Doing so in a\nsquare fire-place one gets rain. If one offers oblations in a triangular fire-place, foes are killed,\nmovements are immobilized Offering flowers, one becomes victorious. Offering substances having\ngreat tastes, one becomes surcharged with supreme joy. The great tastes are the six tastes.\nIII-14: We invoke you, Leader of hosts,\nOf poets, poet, most renowned;\nDoyen of kings, among Brahman-s\nLord of Brahman-s, pay heed to us.\nCome with protection to our homes.\nUttering this hymn, touch the body pronouncing ga with the dot above. Bow down to Ganesha saying\ngam to Ganesha. Om, Bow unto the blessed Lord, with ash-smeared limbs, of formidable prowess.\nKill ! Kill !! burn ! burn !! consume ! consume !! subdue ! subdue !! erase ! erase !! Breaker up of the\nplough ! At the foot of the trident , secure the accomplishment of the symbol. Dry up ! Dry up !! The\nEastern sea ! Immobilize ! Immobilize!! You who disrupt the counsels, the machines, the strategy, the\nmessengers, the armies of the enemy, tear up ! tear up !! cut up ! cut up !! hrim, phat, Svaha. With this\nworship the Lord of the field.\nIII-15: Oh maid of noble lineage !\nWe know, we contemplate a crore\nOf mantras; so many Kula\u2019s force\nInspire us ever.\nThus adoring the maiden, whichever aspirant meditates, attains immortality. He attains renown and the\nfull stretch of life. Or, knowing the Supreme Brahman, he abides. Whosoever knows thus (wins the\nfruit). This is the great Upanishad.\nIV-1: The gods, verily, said to the blessed Lord: Lord ! The heart of the most excellent Gayatri\npertaining to Tripura has been expounded to us.\nIV-2: In the hymn of jatavedas\nTripura\u2019s eight (vidyas) are limned.\nThus adoring Her, from the bonds\nOf life the Yogin is released.\nIV-3: Now tell us about Mrityumjaya (victory over death). Hearing the words of all the gods speaking\nthus, the victory over Death is revealed through the hymn on Tryambaka in the Anustubh metre.\nIV-4: Whence is the word Tryambaka derived ? Being master of the three cities, he is Tryambaka.\nIV-5: Why say: \u2018Let us sacrifice\u2019 ? \u2018Sacrifice\u2019 means \u2018worship\u2019, \u2018extol\u2019 the real, by the two syllables\nmahe. By the immutable single letter kam (after Tryamba) victory over Death is expressed. So it is\nsaid: \u2018Let us sacrifice\u2019.\nIV-6: Now, why say \u2018fragrant\u2019 ? He attains renown on all sides. Hence it is said \u2018fragrant\u2019.\nIV-7: Why say \u2018increases growth\u2019 ? He creates all the worlds, saves all the worlds, pervades all the\nworlds. Hence He is said to increase growth.\nIV-8: Why say \u2018like cucumber fruit \u2026 let me find freedom\u2019 ? As the cucumber is fast held by the stalk,\nso is (man) bound fast, and he is released from death, the bondage of transmigration; he becomes free.\nIV-9: Why say \u2018unto immortality\u2019 ? One achieves immortality, achieves the imperishable; one becomes\nRudra.\nIV-10: The gods verily said to the blessed Lord: Everything has been expounded to us. Now tell us all\nthose mantras pertaining to Siva, Vishnu, Surya, Ganesha, by lauding with which Bhagavati will reveal\n\nHerself.\nIV-11: The blessed Lord said:\nWith \u2018Tryambaka\u2019 in sloka-metre\nWorship the Conqueror of Death;\nIt is laid down that the single letter\nIs pervaded, as shown afore.\nIV-12: One who worships with the mantra of the Yajus, \u2018Om, Obeisance to Siva\u2019 attains the status of\nRudra and achieves blessedness. He who knows thus (does so).\nIV-13: That supreme abode of Vishnu,\nLike an eye across the heavens,\nThe wise always behold.\nIV-14: Vishnu faces all quarters. As oil surrounds and fills a ball of sesamum, He pervades (all things).\nHis supreme abode is the high sky. The wise, namely gods like Brahma, behold it, i.e., hold it for ever\nin the heart. Hence, Vishnu\u2019s own form is derived from His abiding, existing, in all beings. He is\nVasudeva (the god who dwells in all).\nIV-15: Om Namah consists of three syllables. Bhagavate has four syllables. Vasudevaya has five\nsyllables. This is the twelve-syllabled mantra of Vasudeva. He (who knows this) surmounts all\nhardships, lives a full life, achieves mastery over beings, and enjoys possession of wealth and cattle.\nIV-16: The letters a, u and meditation constituting the Pranava denote the inward bliss, the allpervading Brahman. Putting them together, (there is formed) Om.\nIV-17: Swan sailing in the pure sky,\nDweller in the atmosphere,\nSacrificer near the altar,\nGuest walking into the house,\nDweller in men, in noble things,\nIn the right and in sky; in water born,\nBorn in the light, in the right, in mounts;\nThe Right, the great \u2013 (He is the Lord).\nIV-18: All fruits he wins who repeats the previous mantra of the sun together with the Powers, namely\nthe dawn, the dusk, the intellect, which are the true, ordered, embodied Light. By each of the other\nluminous words in the mantra of the Surya is it upheld. Words like, \u2018in water born\u2019, etc., denote the\nPowers. He dwells in the high abode, the heavens, pertaining to the sun.\nIV-19: Worshipping the Lord of hosts with the mantra given previously (III-14), \u2018We invoke you,\nLeader of hosts\u2019, etc., in the traistubha metre, together with the monosyllable, one achieves the status of\nGanesha.\nIV-20: Next have been laid down the Gayatri, the Savitri, the unuttered mantra (ajapa), that of\nSarasvati, the matrika (or alphabet): By It, all this has been pervaded.\nIV-21: Aim, the Goddess of speech ! We know; klim, the Goddess of desire ! We meditate; sau, May\nthe Power inspire us. Thus, in the morn, Gayatri; at midday, Savitri; and at dusk, Sarasvati. The ajapa,\n\u2018hamsa\u2019, the unuttered (is chanted) without break. The matrika, comprising fifty letters, from a to ksa,\npervades all words, all Shastras, all Vedas. The Goddess pervades all things. Obeisance, obeisance,\nunto Her !\nIV-22: The blessed Lord said to them: Whoso perpetually lauds the Goddess with these mantras\nbeholds all things. He attains immortality \u2013 whoso knows this. This is the Upanishad.\nV-1: The gods, verily, said to the blessed Lord: Clearly has been explained to us the section on\nactivities and what pertains to Tripura with all related topics. Next tell us about the attributeless\nSupreme.\nV-2: The blessed Lord spoke to them: By means of the fourth and final Maya (avidya, jnana, vijnana\n\nand samyagjnana), has the supreme Brahman been indicated, the supreme Person, the supreme Self,\nwhose essence is consciousness. The hearer, the thinker, the seer, the teacher, the toucher, the\nproclaimer, the cognizer, the supreme knower, the inner person in all persons \u2013 that Self must be\ncognized.\nV-3: In that there are neither worlds seen nor unseen; no gods or demons; beasts or non-beasts; ascetics\nor non-ascetics; outcastes or non-outcastes; brahmins or non-brahmins. Alone and single, the supreme\nBrahman, all-quiet, shines forth. Gods, seers, manes, prevail not there. The awakened knower, the allknower is Brahman.\nV-4: In this context there are the following verses:\nHence the seeker after liberation\nMust from object his mind withdraw;\nFor, liberation is indeed\nMind\u2019s detachment from objects.\nV-5: Two kinds of minds there are:\nPure and impure;\nImpure the mind, desire-ridden,\nThe pure of desires freed.\nV-6: Mind alone is cause of man\u2019s\nBondage and release; bondage is\nClinging to objects; the mind\nWithdrawn therefrom promotes release.\nV-7: Shorn of attachment to objects,\nAnd restricted to the heart,\nMind thus ceases to be mind \u2013\nSuch is the state supreme.\nV-8: Control the mind until\nIt quiescence reaches in the heart.\nThis is knowledge and meditation;\nThe rest is naught but words.\nV-9: Brahman is not thinkable alone,\nNor unthinkable; think not;\nYet, only think; thus, surely,\nBecome Brahman, the same to all.\nV-10: Yogin dissolves himself with self\nIn Being, through meditation (high);\nMeditation on non-self is deemed\nNo meditation at all.\nV-11: That Brahman has no parts\nIs beyond concepts, without blemish.\nKnowing \u2018I am That\u2019, by slow degrees\nOne Brahman does become.\nV-12: Knowing It as beyond concepts,\nEndless, without cause or parallel;\nImmeasurable and beginningless,\nThe man of wisdom is released.\nV-13: There is no restriction, no origin;\nNone in bondage: none who strives;\nNone seeks liberation; aye, none\nLiberated \u2013 this is truth.\n\nV-14: In wakeful state, in dreams, in sleep\nKnow that the Self is only one;\nFor one who passes beyond these states\nRebirth there is none.\nV-15: One real Self alone exists\nIn diverse beings; as one,\nOr many is It seen, like\nMoon in water\u2019s sheen.\nV-16: As when a pot is moved,\nThe sky, pot-bound moves not \u2013\nSo is the living Self unmoved,\nLike sky when only pot has moved.\nV-17: When repeated in different forms,\nLike pot from pot distinct,\nHe knows not in these divisions,\nAnd yet at all times knows.\nV-18: As long as illusions of words\nEncompass one, difference lasts;\nWhen darkness is scattered,\nIt is unity one sees.\nV-19: The lower Brahman is the Word;\nThe Eternal, when that wears off,\nRemains; Its knower shall, for peace of mind,\nOn the Eternal meditate.\nV-20: Two Brahman-s are to be pondered on:\nThe Word and Brahman Supreme;\nIn the Word well versed, one attains\nBrahman Supreme.\nV-21: The acute mind, after study of texts,\nOn knowledge and wisdom intent,\nMust forsake all, as one who seeks grain\nForsakes the husk perforce.\nV-22: Milk has but a single colour\nThough drawn from diverse cows;\nAs milk is knowledge known,\nIts sources are like cows.\nV-23: Focussing the eye of knowledge\nEvoke the thought: \u2018I am Brahman,\nThe great, supreme abode without\nParts or movement, the quiescent One.\u2019\nV-24: Whoso knows thus the one supreme form of Brahman, the Fourth, abiding in all beings, dwells in\nthe imperishable supreme abode.\nV-25: I seek refuge, for the sake of life, in this fourth Power of Knowledge, the cause of the\nmanifestation of Brahman.\nV-26: In the order of Akasa, etc. Akasa is the supreme source of all these elements. All these beings,\nverily, are born of Akasa, and they merge in Akasa. Because of it they live, once they are born. So,\nknow Akasa to be the seed.\nV-27: That very thing, know as the seat of Akasa, of air, of fire, of water, of precious stones. Whoso\nknows this attains immortality.\n\nV-28: Therefore, whoever knows this fourth (Wisdom or vidya) pertaining to the glory of Kamaraja\n(the Self in liberation) with its elevenfold form as the imperishable Brahman attains the fourth state \u2013\nwhoever knows this. This is the great Upanishad.\nOm ! Gods ! With ears let us hear what is good;\nAdorable ones ! With eyes let us see what is good.\nWith steady limbs, with bodies, praising,\nLet us enjoy the life allotted by the gods.\nMay Indra, of wide renown, grant us well-being;\nMay Pusan, and all-gods, grant us well-being.\nMay Tarksya, of unhampered movement, grant us well-being.\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Tripura-Tapini Upanishad, included in the Atharva-Veda.",
    "Devi": "\nDevi Upanishad\nTranslated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! Gods ! With ears let us hear what is good;\nAdorable ones ! With eyes let us see what is good.\nWith steady limbs, with bodies, praising,\nLet us enjoy the life allotted by the gods.\nMay Indra, of wide renown, grant us well-being;\nMay Pusan, and all-gods, grant us well-being.\nMay Tarksya, of unhampered movement, grant us well-being.\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\n1. All the gods waited upon the Goddess (and asked): \u2018Great Goddess, who art Thou ?\u2019\n2. She replied: I am essentially Brahman. From Me (has proceeded) the world comprising Prakriti and\nPurusha, the void and the Plenum. I am (all forms of) bliss and non-bliss. Knowledge and ignorance are\nMyself. Brahman and non-Brahman are to be known \u2013 says the scripture of the Atharvans.\n3. I am the five elements as also what is different from them. I am the entire world. I am the Veda as\nwell as what is different from it. I am the unborn; I am the born. Below and above and around am I.\n4. I move with Rudras and Vasus, with Adityas and Visvedevas.\nMitra and Varuna, Indra and Agni, I support, and the two Asvins.\n5. I uphold Soma, Tvastir, Pusan and Bhaga,\nThe wide-stepping Vishnu, Brahma, Prajapati.\n6. To the zealous sacrificer offering oblation\nAnd pressing the Soma-juice do I grant wealth;\nI am the state, the Bringer of Wealth;\nAbove it all, place I its protector.\n7. Whoso knows my essence in the water of the inner sea,\nAttains he the Goddess\u2019s abode.\n8. Those gods said:\n\nSalutation to the Goddess, the great Goddess !\nTo Siva, the auspicious, salutation, for ever more.\nTo blessed Prakriti, salutation !\nEver to Her we bow.\n9. Refuge I seek in Her who is the colour of fire,\nBurning with ascetic ardour, Goddess resplendent,\nDelighting in actions\u2019 fruits; O Thou, hard to reach,\nDispel Thy gloom.\n10. The gods engendered divine Speech;\nHer, beasts of all forms speak;\nThe cow that yields sweet fruits and vigour \u2013\nTo us may lauded Speech appear.\n11. To holy Siva, to Daksha\u2019s daughter,\nTo Aditi and Sarasvati,\nTo Skanda\u2019s Mother, Vishnu\u2019s Power,\nTo Night of death by Brahma lauded,\nWe render obeisance.\n12. Know we Great Lakshmi,\nGoddess of good Fortune;\nOn all fulfilment do we meditate.\nMay the Goddess inspire us !\n13. Through You, Dakshayani, was Aditi born;\nShe is your daughter; after her were born\nThe gods auspicious,\nFriends of deathlessness.\n14. Love, womb, love\u2019s part, the bearer of the thunderbolt\nThe cave, ha-sa, the wind, the cloud, Indra;\nAgain the cave, sa-ka-la with Maya \u2013\nSo runs the full primeval science begetting all.\n15. This is the power of Self, enchanting all, armed with the noose, the hook, the bow and the arrow.\nThis is the great and holy Science.\n16. Who knows thus tides over grief.\n17. Divine Mother ! Salutation to you; protect us in all possible ways.\n18. She, here, is the eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the twelve Adityas, She is the all-gods, (those) who\ndrink Soma and (those) who do not; she is the goblins, the demons, the evil beings, the ghosts; she also,\nbeings super-human, the semi-divine. She is Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. She is Prajapati, Indra and Manu.\nShe is the planets, stars and luminous spheres. She is the divisions of time, and the form of primeval\nTime. I salute Her ever:\n19. Goddess who banishes distress\nGrants pleasure and deliverance alike,\nInfinite, victorious, pure,\nSiva, Refuge, the Giver of good.\n20. Seed all-powerful of the Goddess\u2019 mantra,\nIs sky, conjoined with \u2018i\u2019 and fire,\nWith crescent moon adorned.\n21. On the single-syllabled mantra\nMeditate the pure-hearted sages,\nSupremely blissful;\nOf wisdom the veriest oceans.\n\n22. Fashioned by speech; born of Brahman; the sixth\nWith face equipped; the sun; the left ear where\nThe point is; the eighth and the third conjoint.\n23. The air, with Narayana united,\nAnd with the lip; vicce, the nine-lettered;\nThe letter, shall delight the lofty ones.\n24. Seated in the lotus-heart,\nResplendent as the morning sun,\nGoddess, bearing noose and hook,\nWith gesture granting boons, dissolving fears;\nTender, three-eyed, red-robed, granting devotees\nTheir hearts\u2019 desires,\nThee I adore.\n25. I bow to Thee, Goddess,\nThou dispeller of gravest fears,\nVanquisher of obstacles;\nThou wearer of great Mercy\u2019s form.\n26. Brahma and others know not Her essence; so is she called the Unknowable. She has no end; so is\nshe called the Endless. She is not grasped and so is she called the Incomprehensible. Her birth is not\nknown and so is she called the Unborn. She alone is present everywhere, and so is she called the One.\nShe alone wears all forms, and so is she called the Many. For these reasons is she called the\nUnknowable, the Endless, the Incomprehensible, the Unknown, the One and the Many.\n27. The Goddess is the source of all mantras:\nOf all the words the knowledge is Her form.\nHer conscious Form transcends all cognitions;\nShe is the witness of all emptiness.\n28. Beyond Her is nothing; renowned is She\nAs unapproachable; afeared of life,\nI bow to the inaccessible One,\nBulwark against all sins; the Pilot who\nSteers me across the sea of worldly life.\n29. He who studies this Atharva Upanishad gains the fruit of repeating five (other) Atharva Upanishads;\nhe who, having mastered this Atharva Upanishad, persists in worship.\n30. Of this vidya ten million chants\nAre less than the worship\u2019s fruit.\nEight and hundred recitations thereof\nMake but this rite\u2019s inauguration.\n31. Who reads it but ten times,\nIs released at once from sins;\nThrough the grace of the Goddess great,\nTides he over obstacles great.\n32. Reading it in the morning one destroys the sins of the night; reading it in the evening one destroys\nthe sins committed by day. Thus, reading both in the evening and morning, the sinner becomes sinless.\nReading it midnight, too, the fourth \u2018junction\u2019, there results perfection of speech. Its recitation before a\nnew image brings to it the presence of the deity. Its recitation at the time of consecration (of an image)\nmakes it a centre of energy. Reciting it on Tuesday under the asterism Ashvini, in the presence of the\ngreat Goddess, one overcomes fell death \u2013 one who knows thus. This is the secret.\nOm ! Gods ! With ears let us hear what is good;\n\nAdorable ones ! With eyes let us see what is good.\nWith steady limbs, with bodies, praising,\nLet us enjoy the life allotted by the gods.\nMay Indra, of wide renown, grant us well-being;\nMay Pusan, and all-gods, grant us well-being.\nMay Tarksya, of unhampered movement, grant us well-being.\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being.\nOm ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\nHere ends the Devi Upanishad, included in the Atharva-Veda.",

Or, worshipping the digit of desire in its manifold forms,\nEnthroned in the three cavernous homes and in symbols\nOf the rounded breasts and face set in the spheres,\nThe man of desires gains that which he wants.\n12.

    "Katharudra": "\nKatharudra Upanishad\nTranslated by Prof. A. A. Ramanathan\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. The Gods, it is said, requested of the venerable (Brahma): Venerable Sir, impart to us the spiritual\nknowledge. He, the creator (Prajapati), replied:\n2. After removing the hair including the tuft and discarding it, and after removing the sacred thread,\nlooking at one\u2019s son (the following shall be uttered): \u2018Thou art the scripture , thou the sacrifice, thou the\nVasatkara, thou the syllable Om, thou art Svaha, thou Svadha, thou the doer and thou the creator\u2019. Then\nthe son shall say: \u2018I am the scripture , I am the sacrifice, I am the Vasatkara, I am the syllable Om, I am\nSvaha, I am Svadha, I am the doer and I am the creator, I am the divine architect (Tvastir), I am the\nbase\u2019. These are the words (to be uttered). While parting (from the son) he shall not shed tears. Should\nhe shed tears, the line of progeny will be broken. Circumambulating clockwise (his village) and not\nlooking at anything he shall depart. Such a one is fit for the world of Brahman.\n3. After studying the Vedas as a celibate student and performing the duties prescribed in the scriptures,\nafter marrying and begetting sons and providing them with suitable means, having performed sacrifices\naccording to ability, he who has been permitted by elders and relatives shall take to renunciation.\nReaching the forest he shall perform the Agnihotra sacrifice for twelve nights by pouring oblations of\nmilk into the fire; for twelve nights he shall subsist on milk. At the end of twelve nights, the wooden\nvessels, being no more of use, shall be offered to the fire (with the mantra): \u2018This is the oblation of\ncooked rice to the Vaishvanara fire, to Prajapati, (this is) the oblation appointed in three potsherds to\nVishnu and Agni\u2019. The clay pots shall be consigned to the waters; the metal ones shall be given to the\nteacher, with the mantra: \u2018May you not desert me while parting from me, may I not desert you while I\n\npart from you\u2019. He shall prostrate before the three fires \u2013 the household-fire, the southern-fire and the\nfire in which the oblations are offered. Some say that he shall consume a handful of ashes from the\nplace where the fire-kindling sticks stand. After removing the hair including the tuft and discarding it,\nhe shall abandon the sacred thread in the waters with the mantra, \u2018Bhuh Svaha\u2019. Therefore, he shall\nresort to starvation or drowning in water or entering fire, or betake himself to the battle field; or he\nshall journey forward until he falls and dies or he shall enter a hermitage of elderly ascetics. He shall\nconsume milk as the repast (of the evening). That shall be his offering for the evening. That (milk\nwhich he takes) in the morning is his morning (offering); that of the new-moon-day, the new-moon-day\nsacrifice; that of the full-moon-day, the full-moon-day sacrifice. The shaving of the hair, beard, etc.,\nand cutting of nails in the spring comprise his Agnishtoma sacrifice.\n4. After renunciation he shall not resume the fire-rituals. He shall recite the spiritual mantra: \u2018For I have\nbecome Death and would enter that which is coming into being (i.e. Brahman-knowledge)\u2019, etc. Saying\n\u2018Welfare to all beings\u2019, and contemplating the Self and naught else, lifting up the arms, he shall be one\nwho has abandoned the (usual) path; he shall move about without any (fixed) abode. He shall subsist on\nalms, and shall not give any (gift). He shall not wear even scant (apparel) save during the rainy season\nfor the protection of the animal body. Here are the verses (to support this):\n5-6. The water-pot, the ladle, the sling (to carry his effects), the staff, foot-wear, covering to protect\nfrom the cold, the loin-cloth, the garment (to cover the body), the ring of Kusa grass, the bath towel, as\nwell as the upper cloth, the sacred thread and the scriptures \u2013 all these an ascetic shall renounce.\n7. With purified water he shall bathe and wash and also drink of the same. He shall sleep on the sands\nof a river (bank) or in temples.\n8. He shall not make the body endure the extremes of comfort or hardship. He shall not exult when\npraised, nor curse others when blamed.\n9-11. The one who bears a staff (ascetic) shall be unfalteringly firm in celibacy. Looking at, touching,\nsporting, talking about, entering into secret dialogue, imagining, thinking about, or physical enjoyment\n(with women) \u2013 this is what the learned call the eightfold cohabitation. Brahmacharya [celibacy] is the\ncontrary. It should be observed by those who seek Liberation.\n11-12. The self-effulgent light which illumines the world ever shines. It is indeed the witness of the\nworld, the Self of all, pure in form, the basis of all beings, whose nature is pure consciousness.\n13. Not by action, not by (begetting) children, not by anything else, only by knowing Brahman, man\nattains Brahman.\n14-15. That Brahman, which is without a second, and which is Truth, Knowledge and Happiness, is the\nobject of (real) knowing. The best of the twice-born, who know Brahman residing in the cave which is\ncalled the highest heaven, during his transmigratory existence known as \u2018illusion\u2019, \u2018ignorance\u2019, etc.,\nattain all desired things instantaneously.\n16. He who realizes his own Self, which is the witness of the power called ignorance and illusion,\nknowing \u2018I am Brahman alone\u2019 becomes Brahman Itself.\n17. From this Self which is one with Brahman and which is possessed of power (i.e. maya) arose the\nunmanifest ether (Akasa) like a rope-serpent.\n18. Then from the ether emerged the unmanifest touch which is named \u2018air\u2019 (Vayu). Then from air\nemerged fire; from fire, water; and from water, the earth.\n19. Then after dividing and compounding all those subtle (elements) into five, from them alone the\nauspicious Lord created the cosmic egg.\n20. Enfolded in the cosmic egg are gods, anti-gods, Yakshas, Kinnaras, human beings, animals, birds,\netc., in accordance with (the result of) their own actions.\n21. The bodies of beings which appear in the form of (a framework of) bones, sinews, etc., is the self of\nthe nature of food for the all-pervading Self.\n22. Then, further within, is the self of Prana [vital energy] split (into five). Still further within is the self\nof the nature of mind which is different (from the others).\n\n23. Next, even further within and different is the self of the nature of knowledge. Then, in the interior,\ndistinct, is the self of the nature of bliss.\n24. That (self) of the nature of food is pervaded by (the self) of the nature of vital energy; similarly (the\nself of) vital energy is by the nature (pervaded) by (the self) of the nature of mind.\n25. The mind-self is pervaded by the self of knowledge. The ever-happy self of the nature of\nknowledge is always pervaded by bliss.\n26. In the same way, the self of bliss is pervaded by Brahman, the witness, the innermost of all.\nBrahman is not (pervaded) by anything else.\n27-28. By realizing directly this Brahman, which is named the Support (the Tail puccha), which is of\nthe nature of truth, knowledge and non-duality, the essence, the joy, the eternal, the dweller in the body\nbecomes happy everywhere. Wherefrom otherwise can there be happiness ?\n28-29. If this supreme bliss which is the very Self of all beings were not existent, which human being\ncan be alive ? Who can ever be active ?\n29-30. Therefore it is this Being, shining fully in the consciousness, that ever makes happy the\nindividual self, which is otherwise full of sorrow.\n30-32. Only when the great ascetic realizes his complete unity without any difference from this, which\nis described as unseen, etc., he attains total fearlessness. This is the ultimate Good, supreme\nImmortality, absolute Existence, transcendent Brahman, beyond the three divisions (of time).\n32-33. When an individual experiences even a slight difference in this (identity) he will have fear; there\nis no doubt.\n33-34. Because of this sheath of bliss, from (God) Vishnu to a pillar \u2013 all always realize happiness\nthough in different degrees.\n34-35. For him who is versed in the scriptures, disinterested in attaining any position, and happy, the\nbliss which is his very nature shines forth by itself.\n35-36. It is well known that word functions dependent upon a base (like jati, dravya, kriya, guna).\nBecause of the absence of any (such) base, words recoil (from Brahman). For how can the word\nfunction in respect of the absolute bliss devoid of any base ?\n37-38. This subtle mind which makes all things its object turns back from That, from which retreat also\n(the senses), hearing, touch, sight, etc., as well as the organs of actions; they are not capable of reaching\nthe Supreme.\n38-39. Realizing that Brahman which is Bliss, without a second, devoid of attributes, the solidarity of\ntruth and consciousness, as one\u2019s own Self, one fears nought.\n39-40. He who knows thus from the teaching of his Guru, who becomes master of himself, never\nsuffers from the impact of good or bad actions.\n40-41. The whole world which appeared formerly as the inflictor and the inflicted now shines as one\u2019s\nown Self, owing to the knowledge arising from the Vedantic teaching.\n41-42. The pure (Brahman), God, the individual self, the knower, the means of knowledge, the object\nof knowledge and the result \u2013 thus, for empirical purposes, is the sevenfold distinction made.\n43-44. (The Consciousness) devoid of the condition of Maya [cosmic nescience] is termed \u2018pure\u2019\n(Brahman). When related to the cosmic nescience, it is God. Under the influence of the individual\nnescience (Avidya) it is the individual self. When related to the internal organ it is called the knower. In\nrelationship with the modifications of the internal organ, it is called the means of knowledge.\n45-46. The Consciousness which is not known is termed \u2018object\u2019; and the consciousness which is\nknown is called \u2018result\u2019. The intelligent man should meditate upon his own Self as devoid of all\nconditioning.\n46. He who knows this in reality becomes Brahman itself.\n47. Now I speak of the true essence of the teaching of all Vedanta: dying oneself, becoming oneself,\none yet remains oneself. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\n\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm !

Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\n1. The holy Teacher is the Power (Para-Sakti) that is the cause of all.\n2. Of that Power the body with its nine orifices is the form.\n3. It is the holy Wheel in the guise of the nine wheels.\n4. The Power of the Boar is paternal: Kurukulla, the deity of sacrifice, is maternal.\n5. The (four) human Ends are the oceans (purusharthas - dharma, artha, kama and moksha).\n6- 7. The body with the seven constituents (Chile, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen) like the\nskin and the hair is the island of the nine gems.\n8. Resolutions are the wish-granting trees; energy (of the mind) is the garden of the trees of plenty.\n9. The six seasons are the tastes, namely sweet, sour, bitter, pungent, astringent and saltish, which are\napprehended by the tongue.\n10. Knowledge is the material for worship; the object of knowledge is the oblation; the knower is the\nsacrificer. The meditation on the identity of the three, knowledge, its object, and the knower, is the\nworship rendered to the holy Wheel.\n11. Destiny and sentiments like love are (the miraculous attainments like) atomicity, etc. Lust, anger,\ngreed, delusion, elation, envy, merit, demerit \u2013 these constitute the eight powers of Brahma, etc.\n(Brahma, Maheshvari, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Raudri, Charmamunda and Kalasamkarsini).\n12. The nine abodes (muladhara etc.,) are the powers of the mystic gestures.\n13. The earth, water, fire, air, ether, ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose, speech, feet, hands, the organs of\n\nevacuation and generation and the modification of mind are the sixteen powers such as the pull of lust,\netc.\n14. Speech, grasp, motion, evacuation, generation, and the attitudes of rejection, acceptance and apathy\nare the eight (entities) such as the flower of love, etc.\n15. Alambusa, kuhu, visvodara, varana, hastijihva, yasovati, payasvini, gandhari, pusa, sankhini,\nsarasvati, ida, pingala and susumna \u2013 these fourteen arteries are the fourteen powers such as the allexciting, etc.\n16. The five vital breaths and the five minor breaths are the ten divinities of the outer spokes, (styled)\nSarvasiddhiprada, etc.\n17. The digestive fire becomes fivefold through distinctions based on its association with this preeminent breath. (They are) what ejects, what cooks, what dries, what burns and what inundates.\n18. Owing to the prominence of the minor breath, these (fires) in the human body come to be styled as\nthe corroder, the ejector, the agitator, the yawner and the deluder. They promote the digestion of the\nfivefold food: eaten, chewed, sucked, licked and imbibed.\n19. The ten aspects of Fire are the ten divinities of the inner spokes, Sarvajna, etc.\n20. The qualities of cold, heat, pleasure, pain, desire, sattva, rajas and tamas are the eight powers,\nvasini, etc.\n21. The five, rudimentary sound, etc., are the flowery shafts.\n22. Mind is the bow made of sugarcane.\n23. Attachment is the cord (that binds).\n24. Aversion is the hook.\n25. The unmanifest, the Great, and the principle of Egoism are the divinities of the inner triangle:\nKameshvari, Vajreshvari and Bhagamalini.\n26. Absolute awareness, verily, is Kameshvara.\n27. The supreme divinity, Lalita, is one\u2019s own blissful Self.\n28. Of all this the distinctive apprehension is the red glow.\n29. Perfection (ensues from) exclusive concentration of the mind.\n30. In the performance of meditation consist (various acts of) respectful service.\n31. The act of oblation is the merger in the Self of distinctions like I, Thou, Existence, non-Existence,\nthe sense of duty and its negation, and the obligation worship.\n32. Assuagement is the thought of identity of (all) objects of imagination.\n33. The view of time\u2019s transformation into the fifteen days (of the half lunar month) points to the\nfifteen eternal (divinities).\n34. Thus meditating for three instants, or two, or even for a single instant, one becomes liberated while\nliving; one is styled the Siva-Yogin.\n35. Meditations on the inner wheel have been discussed (here) following the tenets of Saktaism.\n36. Whoso knows thus is a student of the Atharvasiras.\nOm ! Gods !

    "Rudrahridaya": "\nRudra Hridaya Upanishad\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nNow, at this moment, I take refuge in that Pure State of the Supreme Absolute which can be known by\nthe Vidya, called the Rudra Hridaya Upanishad.\nAfter prostrating before the celebrated form of Sri Mahadeva-Rudra in his heart, adoring the sacred\nBhasma and Rudraksha and mentally reciting the great Mahavakya-Mantra, Tarasara, Sri Suka asked\nhis father Sri Vyasa Maharshi, thus:\nWho is the real God of gods? In whom are all these existences established? By worshipping whom, can\nI please the Devas in whole?\nHearing these words, Sri Veda Vyasa replied thus:\nRudra is the embodiment of all Devas. All devas are merely different manifestations of Sri Rudra\nHimself. On the right side of Rudra, there is the sun, then the four-headed Brahma, and then three\nAgnis (fires). On the left side, there exist Sri Umadevi, and also Vishnu and Soma (moon).\nUma Herself is the form of Vishnu. Vishnu Himself is the form of the moon. Therefore, those who\nworship Lord Vishnu, worship Siva Himself. And those who worship Siva, worship Lord Vishnu in\nreality. Those who envy and hate Sri Rudra, are actually hating Sri Vishnu. Those who decry Lord Siva,\ndecry Vishnu Himself.\nRudra is the generator of the seed. Vishnu is the embryo of the seed. Siva Himself is Brahma and\nBrahma Himself is Agni. Rudra is full of Brahma and Vishnu. The whole world is full of Agni and\nSoma. The masculine gender is Lord Siva. The feminine gender is Sri Bhavani Devi. All the mobile\nand immobile creation of this universe, is filled up with Uma and Rudra. The Vyakta is Sri Uma, and\nthe Avyakta is Lord Siva. The combination of Uma and Sankara is Vishnu.\nHence everybody should prostrate to Sri Maha Vishnu with great devotion. He is the Atman. He is the\n\nParamatman. He is the Antaratman. Brahma is the Antaratman. Siva is the Paramatman. Vishnu is the\nEternal Atman of all this universe. This whole creation of Svarga, Martya and Patala Lokas is a big\ntree. Vishnu is the top portion (branches) of this tree. Brahma is the stem. The root is Lord Siva.\nThe effect is Vishnu. The action is Brahma. The cause is Siva. For the benefit of the worlds. Rudra has\ntaken these three forms.\nRudra is Dharma. Vishnu is the world. Brahma is Knowledge. Therefore, do Kirtan of His name,\n\u2018Rudra\u2019, \u2018Rudra\u2019. By singing like this, the hallowed name of this great Lord, all your sins will be\ndestroyed.\nRudra is man. Uma is woman. Prostrations to Him and Her. Rudra is Brahma. Uma is Sarasvati.\nProstrations to Him and Her. Rudra is Vishnu. Uma is Lakshmi. Prostrations to Him and Her. Rudra is\nSun. Uma is shadow. Prostrations to Him and Her. Rudra is moon. Uma is star. Prostrations to Him and\nHer. Rudra is day. Uma is night. Prostrations to Him and Her. Rudra is Yajna. Uma is Vedi. Prostrations\nto Him and Her. Rudra is Agni, Uma is Svaha. Prostrations to Him and Her. Rudra is Veda. Uma is\nSastra. Prostrations to Him and Her. Rudra is tree. Uma is creeper. Prostrations to Him and Her. Rudra\nis scent. Uma is flower. Prostrations to Him and Her. Rudra is meaning. Uma is word. Prostrations to\nHim and Her. Rudra is Linga. Uma is Pitha. Prostrations to Him and Her.\nThe devotee should worship Sri Rudra and Uma with these Mantras referred to above. O my son, Suka!\nWith these hymns, you should meditate on the Eternal Para-Brahman, which is beyond the reach of the\nsenses, which is pure Existence, knowledge and Bliss and which cannot be understood either by the\nspeech or by the mind. After knowing this, there is nothing more to be known, because everything is\nthe form of That, and there is nothing separate from That.\nThere are two Vidyas to be known. They are Para and Apara. Apara Vidya is the embodiment of the\nfour Vedas and their six Angas. They do not deal with the Nature of the Atman. But the Para Vidya is\ncalled the Moksha-Sastra. It deals with that supreme philosophy of the Absolute Truth,\nununderstandable, impersonal, Nirguna, Nirakara, without ears, without eyes, without hands, without\nfeet, eternal, omnipresent, imperishable, and knowable by the intelligent daring sages.\nFrom that Lord Siva who performs a terrible penance in the form of Supreme Jnana-Marga, this whole\nworld is created which is the food of the mortals. This world is Maya. It seems to appear just like a\ndream. It is superimposed on the Lord just like a rope on a serpent. This is the eternal Truth. There is no\ncreation in reality. All is absolute. All is Truth. Knowing this, one is liberated at once.\nOnly through Jnana, you can get rid of this Samsara. Only through Jnana, you can understand this\nexistence and never through Karma. Understand this through the guidance of a Brahmanishtha-Srotriya\nGuru. The Guru will give the disciple all the necessary knowledge of Brahman, the Absolute. By\ncutting off the bondage of Ajnana or Avidya, one should take refuge in Lord Sadasiva. This is the real\nwisdom to be understood by an aspirant seeking after Truth.\nThe Pranava is the bow. The Atman is the arrow. The Para-Brahman is the target. Just like the arrow,\nthe Atman will become one with Brahman.\nBut all these three, the bow, the arrow and the target are not different from that Sadasiva. There do not\nshine the bodies of the sun, moon or the stars. There does not blow the wind, there do not exist many\nDevatas. He, the One Lord only exists. He only, the Purity of purities, shines for ever and ever.\nThere are two birds in this body, the Jiva and the Paramatman. The Jiva eats the fruit of his Karmas, but\nthe Paramatman is untouched by anything. The Paramatman is only the Sakshi. He does not do\nanything. He only assumes the form of the Jiva through His Maya, just as the Akasa inside a pot seems\nto be different from the Akasa outside and assumes the form of the pot. In reality all is Siva, Advaita,\nthe One Absolute. There is no difference of whatever kind.\nWhen all is understood to be One, Omkara, the Absolute, there is no sorrow, there is no Maya. Then the\nattainment of the Advaita-Paramananda is very easy. Think that you are the basis of all this universe,\nyou are the One, Kevala, Sat-Chit-Ghana. All people cannot understand this Truth. Those devoid of\nMaya can know this secret. After knowing this, the Atman does not move towards any place at any\n\ntime. It becomes one with the Absolute, just like Ghatakasa with Paramakasa. Just as Akasa does not\nmove anywhere, similarly this Atman does not have any movement. It becomes one with OM.\nOne who knows this great secret Truth is the real Muni. He becomes the Para-Brahman Itself. He\nbecomes Satchidananda. He attains permanent peace.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Rudra-Hridayopanishad belonging to the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",

If one of them is controlled, then both are\ncontrolled.\n2. Of these two, a person should control (Prana) Vayu always through moderate food, postures and\nthirdly Sakti-Chala.\n3-4. I shall explain the nature of these. Listen to it, O Gautama. One should take a sweet and nutritious\nfood, leaving a fourth (of his stomach) unfilled, in order to please Shiva (the patron of Yogins). This is\ncalled moderate food. Posture herein required is of two kinds, Padma and Vajra.\n5. Placing the two heels over the two opposite thighs (respectively) is the Padma (posture) which is the\ndestroyer of all sins.\n6. Placing one heel below the Mulakanda and the other over it and sitting with the neck, body and head\nerect is the Vajra posture.\n7. The Sakti (mentioned above) is only Kundalini. A wise man should take it up from its place (Viz.,\nthe navel, upwards) to the middle of the eyebrows. This is called Sakti-Chala.\n8. In practising it, two things are necessary, Sarasvati-Chalana and the restraint of Prana (breath). Then\nthrough practice, Kundalini (which is spiral) becomes straightened.\n9-10(a). Of these two, I shall explain to you first Sarasvati-Chalana. It is said by the wise of old that\nSarasvati is no other than Arundhati. It is only by rousing her up that Kundalini is roused.\n10(b)-11(a). When Prana breath is passing through (one\u2019s) Ida (left nostril), he should assume firmly\nPadma-posture and should lengthen (inwards) 4 digits the Akasa of 12 digits.\n\n11(b)-13(a). Then the wise man should bind the (Sarasvati) Nadi by means of this lengthened (breath)\nand holding firmly together (both his ribs near the navel) by means of the forefingers and thumbs of\nboth hands, (one hand on each side) should stir up Kundalini with all his might from right to left often\nand often; for a period of two Muhurtas (48 minutes), he should be stirring it up fearlessly.\n13(b)-14. Then he should draw up a little when Kundalini enters Susumna. By this means, Kundalini\nenters the mouth of Susumna. Prana (also) having left (that place) enters of itself the Susumna (along\nwith Kundalini).\n15. By compressing the neck, one should also expand the navel. Then by shaking Sarasvati, Prana goes\nabove (to) the chest.\n16-17. Through the contraction of the neck, Prana goes above from the chest. Sarasvati who has sound\nin her womb should be shaken (or thrown into vibration) each day. Therefore by merely shaking it, one\nis cured of diseases.\n18. Gulma (a splenetic disease), Jalodara (dropsy), Pliha (a splenetic disease) and all other diseases\narising within the belly, are undoubtedly destroyed by shaking this Sakti.\n19. I shall now briefly describe to you Pranayama. Prana is the Vayu that moves in the body and its\nrestraint within is known as Kumbhaka.\n20. It is of two kinds, Sahita and Kevala. One should practise Sahita till he gets Kevala.\n21. There are four Bhedas (lit., piercings or divisions) viz., Surya, Ujjayi, Sitali and Bhastri. The\nKumbhaka associated with these four is called Sahita Kumbhaka.\n22-23. Being seated in the Padma posture upon a pure and pleasant seat which gives ease and is neither\ntoo high nor too low, and in a place which is pure, lovely and free from pebbles, etc., and which for the\nlength of a bow is free from cold, fire and water, one should shake (or throw into vibration) Sarasvati;\n24. Slowly inhaling the breath from outside, as long as he desires, through the right nostril, he should\nexhale it through the left nostril.\n25. He should exhale it after purifying his skull (by forcing the breath up). This destroys the four kinds\nof evils caused by Vayu as also by intestinal worms.\n26(a). This should be done often and it is this which is spoken of as Surya-Bheda.\n26(b)-27. Closing the mouth and drawing up slowly the breath as before with the nose through both the\nNadis (or nostrils) and retaining it in the space between the heart and the neck, one should exhale it\nthrough the left nostril.\n28. This destroys the heat caused in the head as well as the phlegm in the throat. It removes all diseases,\npurifies his body and increases the (gastric) fire within.\n29. It removes also the evils arising in the Nadis, Jalodara (waterbelly or dropsy) and Dhatus. This\nKumbhaka is called Ujjayi and may be practised (even) when walking or standing.\n30. Drawing up the breath as before through the tongue with (the hissing sound of) \u2018Sa\u2019 and retaining it\nas before, the wise man should slowly exhale it through (both) the nostrils.\n31. This is called Sitali Kumbhaka and destroys diseases, such as Gulma, Pitha, consumption, bile,\nfever, thirst and poison.\n32. Seated in the Padma posture with belly and neck erect, the wise man should close the mouth and\nexhale with care through the nostrils.\n33. Then he should inhale a little with speed up to the heart, so that the breath may fill the space with\nnoise between the neck and skull.\n34-35. Then he should exhale in the same way and inhale often and often. Just as the bellows of a smith\nare moved (viz., stuffed with air within and then the air is let out), so he should move the air within his\nbody. If the body gets tired, then he should inhale through the right nostril.\n36-37(a). If his belly is full of Vayu, then he should press well his nostrils with all his fingers except his\nforefinger and performing Kumbhaka as before, should exhale through the left nostril.\n37(b)-38. This frees one from diseases of fire in (or inflammation of) the throat, increases the gastric\nfire within, enables one to know the Kundalini, produces purity removing sins, gives happiness and\n\npleasure and destroys phlegm which is the bolt (or obstacle) to the door at the mouth of Brahma-Nadi\n(viz., Susumna).\n39. It pierces also the three Granthis (or knots) differentiated through the three Gunas. This Kumbhaka\nis known as Bhastri and should especially be performed.\n40. Through these four ways when Kumbhaka is near (or is about to be performed), the sinless Yogin\nshould practise the three Bandhas.\n41. The first is called Mulabandha. The second is called Uddiyana and the third is Jalandhara. Their\nnature will be thus described.\n42. Apana (breath) which has a downward tendency is forced up by one bending down. This process is\ncalled Mulabandha.\n43. When Apana is raised up and reaches the sphere of Agni (fire), then the flame of Agni grows long,\nbeing blown about by Vayu.\n44-45(a). Then Agni and Apana come to (or commingle with) Prana in a heated state. Through this\nAgni which is very fiery, there arises in the body the flaming (or the fire) which rouses the sleeping\nKundalini through its heat.\n45(b)-46. Then this Kundalini makes a hissing noise, becomes erect like a serpent beaten with stick and\nenters the hole of Brahmanadi (Susumna). Therefore Yogins should daily practise Mulabandha often.\n47-48(a). Uddiyana should be performed at the end of Kumbhaka and at the beginning of expiration.\nBecause Prana Uddiyate (viz., goes up) the Susumna in this Bandha, therefore is called Uddiyana by\nthe Yogins.\n48(b)-49(a). Being seated in the Vajra posture and holding firmly the two toes by the two hands, he\nshould press at the Kanda and at the place near the two ankles.\n49(b)-50. Then he should gradually upbear the Tana (thread or Nadi) which is on the western side first\nto Udara (the upper part of the abdomen above the navel), then to the heart and then to the neck. When\nPrana reaches the Sandhi (junction) of navel, slowly it removes the impurities (or diseases) in the navel.\nTherefore this should be frequently practised.\n51. The Bandha called Jalandhara should be practised at the end of Kumbhaka. This Jalandhara is of\nthe form of the contraction of the neck and is an impediment to the passage of Vayu (upwards).\n52. When the neck is contracted at once by bending downwards (so that the chin may touch the breast),\nPrana goes through Brahmanadi on the western Tana in the middle.\n53. Assuming the seat as mentioned before, one should stir up Sarasvati and control Prana.\n54. On the first day Kumbhaka should be done four times; on the second day it should be done ten\ntimes and then five times separately;\n55. On the third day, twenty times will do and afterwards Kumbhaka should be performed with the\nthree Bandhas and with an increase of five times each day.\n56-57. Diseases are generated in one\u2019s body through the following causes, viz., sleeping in daytime,\nlate vigils over night, excess of sexual intercourse, moving in crowd, the checking of the discharge of\nurine and faeces, the evil of unwholesome food and laborious mental operation with Prana.\n58. If a Yogin is afraid of such diseases (when attacked by them), he says, \u201cmy diseases have arisen\nfrom my practice of Yoga\u201d. Then he will discontinue this practice. This is said to be the first obstacle to\nYoga.\n59. The second (obstacle) is doubt; the third is carelessness; the fourth, laziness; the fifth, sleep;\n60. The sixth, the not leaving of objects (of sense); the seventh, erroneous perception; the eighth,\nsensual objects; the ninth, want of faith;\n61. And the tenth, the failure to attain the truth of Yoga. A wise man should abandon these ten obstacles\nafter great deliberation.\n62. The practice of Pranayama should be performed daily with the mind firmly fixed on Truth. Then\nChitta is absorbed in Susumna and Prana (therefore) never moves.\n63. When the impurities (of Chitta) are thus removed and Prana is absorbed in Susumna, he becomes a\n\n(true) Yogin.\n64. Apana, which has a downward tendency should be raised up with effort by the contraction (of the\nanus) and this is spoken of as Mulabandha.\n65. Apana thus raised up mixes with Agni and then they go up quickly to the seat of Prana. Then Prana\nand Apana uniting with one another go to Kundalini, which is coiled up and asleep.\n66-67. Kundalini being heated by Agni and stirred up by Vayu, extends her body in the mouth of\nSusumna, pierces the Brahmagranthi formed of rajas and flashes at once like lightning at the mouth of\nSusumna.\n68-69(a). Then it goes up at once through Vishnugranthi to the heart. Then it goes up through\nRudragranthi and above it to the middle of the eyebrows; having pierced this place, it goes up to the\nMandala (sphere) of the moon.\n69(b)-70(a). It dries up the moisture produced by the moon in the Anahata-Chakra having sixteen\npetals.\n70(b)-71. When the blood is agitated through the speed of Prana, it becomes bile from its contact with\nthe sun, after which it goes to the sphere of the moon where it becomes of the nature of the flow of pure\nphlegm. How does it (blood) which is very cold become hot when it flows there ?\n72. (Since) at the same time the intense white form of moon is speedily heated. Then being agitated, it\ngoes up.\n73. Through taking in this, Chitta which was moving amidst sensual objects externally, is restrained\nthere. The novice enjoying this high state attains peace and becomes devoted to Atman.\n74. Kundalini assumes the eight forms of Prakriti (matter) and attains Shiva by encircling him and\ndissolves itself in Shiva.\n75. Thus Rajas-Sukla (seminal fluid) which rises up goes to Shiva along with Marut (Vayu); Prana and\nApana which are always produced become equal.\n76. Pranas flow in all things, great and small, describable, or indescribable, as fire in gold.\n77. Then this body which is Adhibhautika (composed of elements) becomes Adhidaivata (relating to a\ntutelar deity) and is thus purified. Then it attains the stage of Ativahika.\n78. Then the body being freed from the inert state becomes stainless and of the nature of Chit. In it, the\nAtivahika becomes the chief of all, being of the nature of That.\n79. Like the conception of the snake in a rope, so the idea of the release from life and Samsara is the\ndelusion of time.\n80. Whatever appears is unreal. Whatever is absorbed is unreal. Like the illusory conception of silver in\nthe mother-of-pearl, so is the idea of man and woman.\n81. The microcosm and the macrocosm are one and the same; so also the Linga and Sutratman,\nSvabhava (substance) and form and the self-resplendent light and Chidatma.\n82. The Sakti named Kundalini, which is like a thread in the lotus and is resplendent, is biting with the\nupper end of its hood (namely, mouth) at the root of the lotus the Mulakanda.\n83-84. Taking hold of its tail with its mouth, it is in contact with the hole of Brahmarandhra (of\nSusumna). If a person seated in the Padma posture and having accustomed himself to the contraction of\nhis anus makes his Vayu go upward with the mind intent on Kumbhaka, then Agni comes to\nSvadhisthana flaming, owing to the blowing of Vayu.\n85. From the blowing of Vayu and Agni, the chief (Kundalini) pierces open the Brahmagranthi and then\nVishnugranthi.\n86. Then it pierces Rudragranthi, after that, (all) the six lotuses (or plexuses). Then Sakti is happy with\nShiva in Sahasrara Kamala (1000 lotuses seat or pineal gland). This should be known as the highest\nAvastha (state) and it alone is the giver of final beatitude.\nThus ends the first chapter.\nCHAPTER - II\n\n1. I shall hereafter describe the science called Khechari which is such that one who knows it is freed\nfrom old age and death in this world.\n2. One who is subject to the pains of death, disease and old age should, O sage, on knowing this science\nmake his mind firm and practise Khechari.\n3-4. One should regard that person as his guru on earth who knows Khechari, the destroyer of old age\nand death, both from knowing the meaning of books and practice, and should perform it with all his\nheart. The science of Khechari is not easily attainable, as also its practice.\n5. Its practice and Melana are not accomplished simultaneously. Those that are bent upon practice alone\ndo not get Melana.\n6. Only some get the practice, O Brahmana, after several births, but Melana is not obtained even after a\nhundred births.\n7. Having undergone the practice after several births, some (solitary) Yogin gets the Melana in some\nfuture birth as the result of his practice.\n8. When a Yogin gets this Melana from the mouth of his Guru, then he obtains the Siddhis mentioned in\nthe several books.\n9. When a man gets this Melana through books and the significance, then he attains the state of Shiva\nfreed from all rebirth.\n10. Even Gurus may not be able to know this without books. Therefore this science is very difficult to\nmaster.\n11. An ascetic should wander over the earth so long as he fails to get this science and when this science\nis obtained, then he has got the Siddhi in his hand (viz., mastered the psychical powers).\n12. Therefore one should regard as Achyuta (Vishnu) the person who imparts the Melana, as also him\nwho gives out the science.\n13. He should regard as Shiva him who teaches the practice. Having got this science from me, you\nshould not reveal it to others.\n14-15. Therefore one who knows this should protect it with all his efforts (viz., should never give it out\nexcept to persons who deserve it). O Brahmana, one should go to the place where lives the Guru, who\nis able to teach the divine Yoga and there learn from him the science Khechari and being then taught\nwell by him, should at first practise it carefully.\n16-17. By means of this science, a person will attain the Siddhi of Khechari. Joining with Khechari\nSakti (viz., Kundalini Sakti) by means of the (science) of Khechari which contains the Bija (seed of\nletter) of Khechari, one becomes the lord of Khecharas (Devas) and lives always amongst them.\nKhechari Bija (seed-letter) is spoken of as Agni encircled with water and as the abode of Khecharas\n(Devas).\n18. Through this Yoga, Siddhi is mastered. The ninth (Bija) letter of Somamsa (Soma or moon part)\nshould also be pronounced in the reverse order.\n19. Then a letter composed of three Amsas of the form of moon has been described; and after that, the\neight letter should be pronounced in the reverse order;\n20. Then consider it as the supreme and its beginning as the fifth and this is said to the Kuta (horns) of\nthe several bhinnas (or parts) of the moon.\n21-22(a). This which tends to the accomplishment of all Yogas, should be learnt through the initiation\nof a Guru. He who recites this twelve times every day, will not get even in sleep that Maya (illusion)\nwhich is born in his body and which is the source of all vicious deeds.\n22(b)-23. He who recites this five lakhs of times with very great care \u2013 to him the science of Khechari\nwill reveal itself. All obstacles vanish and the Devas are pleased.\n24. The destruction of Valipalita (viz., wrinkle and greyness of hair) will take place without doubt.\nHaving acquired this great science, one should practise it afterwards.\n25-26. If not, O Brahmana, he will suffer without getting any Siddhi in the path of Khechari. If one\ndoes not get this nectar like science in this practice, he should get it in the beginning of Melana and\n\nrecite it always; (else) one who is without it never gets Siddhi.\n27. As soon as he gets this science, he should practise it; and then the sage will soon get the Siddhi.\n28. Having drawn out the tongue from the root of the palate, a knower of Atman should clear the\nimpurity (of the tongue) for seven days according to the advice of his Guru.\n29. He should take a sharp knife which is oiled and cleaned and which resembles the leaf of the plant\nSnuhi (\u201cEuphorbia Antiquorum\u201d) and should cut for the space of a hair (the Fraenum Lingui).\n30. Having powdered Saindhava (rock-salt) and Pathya (sea-salt), he should apply it to the place. On\nthe seventh day, he should again cut for the space of a hair.\n31. Thus for the space of six months, he should continue it always gradually with great care. In six\nmonths, Siro-Bandha (Bandha at the head), which is at the root of the tongue is destroyed.\n32. Then the Yogin who knows timely action should encircle with Siro-Vastra (lit. the cloth of the head)\nthe Vak-Ishvari (the deity presiding over speech) and should draw (it) up.\n33. Again by daily drawing it up for six months, it comes, O sage, as far as the middle of the eyebrows\nand obliquely up to the opening of the ears;\n34. Having gradually practised, it goes to the root of the chin. Then in three years, it goes up easily to\nthe end of the hair (of the head).\n35-36. It goes up obliquely to Sakha and downwards to the well of the throat. In another three years, it\noccupies Brahmarandhra and stops there without doubt. Crosswise it goes up to the top of the head and\ndownwards to the well of the throat.\n37. Gradually it opens the great adamantine door in the head. The rare science (of Khechari) Bija has\nbeen explained before.\n38. One should perform the six Angas (parts) of this Mantra by pronouncing it in six different\nintonations. One should do this in order to attain all the Siddhis;\n39. And this Karanyasam should be done gradually and not all at a time, since the body of one who\ndoes it all at once will soon decay.\n40-41(a). Therefore it should be practised, O best of sages, little by little. When the tongue goes to the\nBrahmarandhra through the outer path, then one should place the tongue after moving the bolt of\nBrahma which cannot be mastered by the Devas.\n41(b)-42. On doing this for three years with the point of finger, he should make the tongue enter within;\nthen it enters Brahmadvara (or hole). On entering the Brahmadvara, one should practise Mathana\n(churning) well.\n43. Some intelligent men attain Siddhi even without Mathana. One who is versed in Khechari Mantra\naccomplishes it without Mathana.\n44-46(a). By doing the Japa and Mathana, one reaps the fruits soon. By connecting a wire made of\ngold, silver or iron with the nostrils by means of a thread soaked in milk, one should restrain his breath\nin his heart and seated in a convenient posture with his eyes concentrated between his eyebrows, he\nshould perform Mathana slowly.\n46(b)-47. In six months, the state of Mathana becomes natural like sleep in Children. And it is not\nadvisable to do Mathana always. It should be done (once) only in every month.\n48. A Yogin should not revolve his tongue in the path. After doing this for twelve years, Siddhi is surely\nobtained.\n49. Then he sees the whole universe in his body as not being different from Atman. This path of the\nUrdhva-Kundalini (higher Kundalini), O chief of Kings, conquers the macrocosm.\nThus ends the second chapter.\nCHAPTER - III\n1. Melana-Mantra: Hrim, Bham, Sam, Pam, Pham, Sam, Ksham. The lotus-born (Brahma) said: \u201cO\nShankara, (among) new moon (the first day of the lunar fortnight) and full moon, which is spoken of as\nits (mantra\u2019s) sign ?\n\n2. In the first day of lunar fortnight and during new moon and full moon (days), it should be made firm\nand there is no other way (or time).\n3. A man longs for an object through passion and is infatuated with passion for objects. One should\nalways leave these two and seek the Niranjana (stainless).\n4-5. He should abandon everything else which he thinks is favourable to himself. Keeping the Manas in\nthe midst of Sakti and Sakti in the midst of Manas, one should look into Manas by means of Manas.\nThen he leaves even the highest stage. Manas alone is the Bindu, the cause of creation and\npreservation.\n6. It is only through Manas that Bindu is produced, like the curd from milk. The organs of Manas is not\nthat which is situated in the middle of Bandhana.\n7-8(a). Bandhana is there where Sakti is between the sun and moon. Having known Susumna and its\nBheda (piercing) and making the Vayu go in the middle, one should stand in the seat of Bindu and close\nthe nostrils.\n8(b)-9(a). Having known Vayu, the above-mentioned Bindu and the Sattva-Prakriti as well as the six\nChakras, one should enter the Sukha-Mandala (viz., the Sahasrara or pineal gland, the sphere of\nhappiness).\n9(b)-11. There are six Chakras. Muladhara is in the anus; Svadhisthana is near the genital organ;\nManipuraka is in the navel; Anahata is in the heart; Visuddhi is at the root of the neck and Ajna is in the\nhead (between the two eyebrows).\n12. Having known these six Mandalas (spheres), one should enter the Sukha-Mandala (pineal gland),\ndrawing up the Vayu and should send it (Vayu) upwards.\n13. He who practises thus (the control of) Vayu becomes one with Brahmanda (the macrocosm). He\nshould practise (or master) Vayu, Bindu, Chitta and Chakra.\n14-15. Yogins attain the nectar of equality through Samadhi alone. Just as the fire latent in (Sacrificial)\nwood does not appear without churning, so the lamp of wisdom does not arise without the Abhyasa\nYoga (or practice of Yoga). The fire placed in a vessel does not give light outside.\n16. When the vessel is broken, its light appears without. One\u2019s body is spoken of as the vessel and the\nseat of \u2018That\u2019 is the fire (or light) within;\n17-18(a). And when it (the body) is broken through the words of a Guru, the light of Brahma Jnana\nbecomes resplendent. With the Guru as the helmsman, one crosses the subtle body and the ocean of\nSamsara through the affinities of practice.\n18(b)-19. That Vak (power of speech) which sprouts in Para, gives forth two leaves in Pashyanti; buds\nforth in Madhyama and blossoms in Vaikhari \u2013 that Vak which has before been described, reaches the\nstage of the absorption of sound, reversing the above order (viz., beginning with Vaikhari, etc.,).\n20-21(a). Whoever thinks that He who is the great lord of that Vak, who is the undifferentiated and who\nis the illuminator of that Vak is Self; whoever thinks over thus, is never affected by words, high or low\n(or good or bad).\n21(b)-23(a). The three (aspects of consciousness), Vishva, Taijasa and Prajna (in man), the three Virat,\nHiranyagarbha and Ishvara in the universe, the egg of the universe, the egg of man and the seven\nworlds \u2013 all these in turn are absorbed in Pratyagatman through the absorption of their respective\nUpadhis (vehicles).\n23(b)-24(a). The egg being heated by the fire of Jnana is absorbed with its Karana (cause) into\nParamatman (Universal Self). Then it becomes one with Para-Brahman.\n24(b)-25. It is then neither steadiness nor depth, neither light nor darkness, neither describable nor\ndistinguishable. Sat (Be-ness) alone remains. One should think of Atman as being within the body like\na light in a vessel.\n26. Atman is of the dimensions of a thumb, is a light without smoke and without form, is shining within\n(the body) and is undifferentiated and immutable.\n27-28(a). The Vijnana Atman that dwells in this body is deluded by Maya during the states of waking,\n\ndreaming and dreamless sleep; but after many births, owing to the effect of good Karma, it wishes to\nattain its own state.\n28(b)-29(a). Who am I ? How has this stain of mundane existence accrued to me ? What becomes in\nthe dreamless sleep of me who am engaged in business in the waking and dreaming states ?\n29(b)-30. Just as a bale of cotton is burnt by fire, so the Chidabhasa which is the result of non-wisdom,\nis burnt by the (wise) thoughts like the above and by its own supreme illumination. The outer burning\n(of body as done in the world) is no burning at all.\n31-32. When the worldly wisdom is destroyed, Pratyagatman that is in the Dahara (Akasa or ether of\nthe heart) obtains Vijnana, diffusing itself everywhere and burns in an instant Jnanamaya and\nManomaya (sheaths). After this, He himself shines always within, like a light within a vessel.\n33. That Muni who contemplates thus till sleep and till death is to be known as a Jivanmukta. Having\ndone what ought to be done, he is a fortunate person.\n34. And having given up (even) the state of a Jivanmukta, he attains Videhamukta (emancipation in a\ndisembodied state), after his body wears off. He attains the state, as if of moving in the air.\n35. Then That alone remains which is soundless, touchless, formless and deathless, which is the Rasa\n(essence), eternal, and odourless, which has neither beginning nor end, which is greater than the great\nand which is permanent, stainless and decayless.\nThus ends the third chapter.\nHari Om Tat Sat !\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Yogakundalini Upanishad belonging to the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Bhasma": "\nBhasma Jabala Upanishad\nOm! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nI am that Absolute Brahman only which, after being understood in its true aspect (as one with this\nAtman), entirely burns into ashes (Bhasma) the ignorance (illusion or Maya) of considering this\nuniverse to be existing (real) and separate from one\u2019s own Self, through the destructive fire of\n(Supreme) Knowledge!\nOnce Bhusunda, a descendant of Jabali went to the Kailas Peak and prostrated before Lord Mahadeva\nSiva, who is the form of Omkara and who is beyond the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra.\nBhusunda worshipped Siva with great devotion again and again through fruits, flowers and leaves.\nThen he questioned Lord Siva: \u201cLord! Kindly impart to me the essential knowledge of all the Vedas,\nembodying the process and technique of using the Bhasma (sacred ash), because it is the only means\nfor attaining Liberation. What is the Bhasma made of? Where should it be applied? What are the\nMantras to be recited? Who are the persons fitted for this? What are the rules regarding it? Kindly\ninstruct me, born from depressed class.\u201d\nThe kind Lord Paramesvara said: At first the devotee after understanding the influence of the celestials\nat the prescribed time, should fetch some sacred and pure cow-dung early in the morning, keep it in the\nleaf of a Palasa-tree and then dry it with the Vedic Mantra \u2018Tryambakam\u2019 etc. (in the sun).\nThen he should burn that dry cow-dung, placed in a convenient place, with any fire that is available,\naccording to the rules laid down in the Grihya Sutras of his sect, and then pour Ahutis of seasamum and\npaddy together with ghee, with the Mantra \u2018Somaya Svaha\u2019. The number of Ahutis should be 1008, or\n\nif possible, 1 \u00bd times this. The instruments for pouring ghee should be made of leaf; in that case man\ndoes not commit any sin.\nThen, at the end, the devotee should offer the oblation of Sveshtakruta at the time of Purna-Ahuti, with\nthe Mantra \u2018Tryambakam\u2019 etc. With the same Mantra Bali (an offering) should be placed in the eight\ndirections (of the fire).\nThat Bhasma should be sprinkled with water by the Gayatri Mantra. Then that sacred ash should be\nplaced in a gold, silver, copper or earthen vessel and sprinkled again with the Rudra Mantras. It should\nthen be kept in a clean and decent place.\nThen the devotee should honour the Brahmins with a grand feast. Then only he will become purified.\nThen he should take the Bhasma from the vessel with the Pancha-Brahma-Mantras, \u2018Manastoka\u2019,\n\u2018Sadyo Jatam\u2019, etc., and with the idea that \u2018fire is Bhasma, air is Bhasma, water is Bhasma, earth is\nBhasma, ether is Bhasma, gods are Bhasma, Rishis are Bhasma, all this universe and existence are\nBhasma; I prostrate to this sacred and purifying Bhasma which destroys all my sins.\u2019\nThus, the devotee should keep a little Bhasma with the clean palm of his left hand saying,\n\u2018Vamadevaya\u2019 (this is to Vamadeva) sprinkling with the Mantra \u2018Tryambakam\u2019 etc., and cleaning it\nwith the Mantra \u2018Suddham suddhena\u2019 etc. Then he should filter it nicely. Then he should apply it from\nhead to foot, with the five Brahma-Mantras. With the first finger, middle finger and ring finger, he\nshould apply the same to the middle of the head saying \u2018to the head\u2019 and \u2018O Bhasma! Thou hast come\nfrom Agni!\u2019\nHe should apply bhasma at the top of the head with the mantra \u2018Murdhanam.\u2019 On the forehead with\n\u2018Tryambakam etc.\u2019, on the neck with \u2018Nilagrivaya etc., on the right side of the neck with \u2018Tryayusham\netc. and Vama etc.\u2019, on the cheeks with \u2018Kalaya etc.\u2019, on the \u2018eyes with \u2018Trilochanaya etc.\u2019, on the ears\nwith \u2018Srinavama etc.\u2019, on the mouth with \u2018Prabravama etc.\u2019, on the heart (chest) with \u2018Atmane etc.\u2019, on\nthe navel with \u2018Nabhih etc.\u2019, on the right shoulder with \u2018Bhavaya etc.\u2019, on the right elbow with\n\u2018Rudraya etc.\u2019, on the right wrist with \u2018Sarvaya etc.\u2019, on the back of the right palm with \u2018Pasupataye\netc.\u2019, on the left shoulder with \u2018Ugraya etc.\u2019, on the left elbow with \u2018Agre-vadhaya etc.\u2019, on the left\nwrist with \u2018Dure-vadhaya etc.\u2019, on the back of the left palm with \u2018Namo Hartre etc.\u2019, and over the\nshoulder-blades with \u2018Sankaraya etc.\u2019.\nThe devotee should then prostrate to Siva with the Mantra \u2018Somaya\u2019 etc. He should wash the hands and\ndrink that ash-water with the Mantra \u2018Apah Punantu\u2019 etc. The water should never be spilt down from\nany cause.\nThus, this practice of Bhasmadharana should be done in the morning, noon and evening. If he does not\ndo this, he will become fallen. This very thing is the prescribed Dharma of all Brahmins. Without\nhaving Bhasmadharana in this fashion, he should never take any food, water or anything else.\nAccidentally if this practice is forgotten, that day, Gayatri should not be repeated. No Yajna should be\ndone on that day; no Tarpana should be offered to gods, Rishis or Pitrus. This is the eternal Dharma that\ndestroys all sins and gives the final state of Moksha.\nThis is the daily rite of Brahmins, Brahmacharins, Grihasthas, Vanaprasthas and Sannyasins. If this is\noverlooked even once, he should stand in water upto the neck, repeating Gayatri 108 times, and fast the\nwhole day. If a Sannyasin does not wear Bhasma, even a single day, he should fast during the whole\nday and do 1000 Pranava Japa, for being purified once again. Otherwise, the Lord will throw these\nSannyasins to dogs and wolves.\nIn case this kind of Bhasma is not available, any other Bhasma that may be at hand should be used with\nthe prescribed Mantras. This kind of practice shall destroy any kind of sin that may be committed by\nman.\nThen again Bhusunda asked Siva: What are the daily rites to be performed by a Brahmin, by neglecting\nwhich he will commit a sin? Who is to be then meditated upon? Who is to be remembered? How to\nmeditate? Where to practice this? Please tell me in detail.\nThe Lord answered all in a nutshell: First of all the devotee should get up early in the morning before\n\nsunrise, and after finishing the purificatory actions, should take his bath. He should clean the body with\nthe Rudra Suktas. Then he should wear a clean cloth. After this, he should meditate on the sun-god and\napply Bhasma to all the prescribed parts of the body.\nHe should then wear white Rudraksha, as prescribed. Some prescribe the following way of wearing\nRudraksha beads: Over the head should be worn forty rudraksha beads. One or three beads on the\nchest. Twelve beads over each of the two ears. Thirt-two beads around the neck. Sixteen beads around\neach of the upper arms. Twelve beads around each of the wrists. Six beads around each of the thumbs.\nThen the devotee should observe Sandhya with the Kusa grass in his hand. He should do Japa of either\nSiva-Shadakshara or Siva-Ashtakshara. \u2018Om Namah Sivaya\u2019 and \u2018Om Namo Mahadevaya\u2019 are the two\nMantras. This is the highest truth and the greatest instruction. I myself am that Great Lord Siva, God of\nall gods, the Supreme Controller of all the universes. I am that Impersonal Brahman, I am Omkara, I\nam the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer of all. Through My terror only, all are working properly. I am\nthis world and the five elements. I am the Highest Truth that exists, the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nThis is the greatest Vidya.\nI am the only giver of Moksha. Hence all people come to Me for final help. That is why I absorb into\nMy Being those creatures who leave their Pranas at Banares which is standing at the top of My Trisula\n(trident). Therefore, everyone should perform penance at Banares only. Banares should not be\nneglected under any circumstance. Everybody should try to live at Banares as far as possible. No place\nis better than Banares.\nEven at Banares, the most celebrated is the temple of Siva, where in the East, there is the place of\nWealth, in the South, the place of Vichara, in the West, the place of Vairagya and in the North, the place\nof Jnana. There in the middle, I, the Eternal Spirit should be worshipped. That Linga at Banares, is not\nillumined by the sun, moon or the stars. That self-luminous Linga called \u2018Visvesvara\u2019 has its root in\nPathala. That is Myself. I should be worshipped by one who wears the sacred Bhasma and Rudrakshas\nin the prescribed manner. I shall deliver him from all sins and sorrows.\nBy performing My Abhisheka, he attains My Sayujya state. Nothing exists other than Myself. I initiate\nall with the Taraka Mantra. Those who want Mukti should live at Banares. I will take care of them. I\nam the Lord of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra. The most corrupt man or woman will attain Moksha, if he\nor she dies at Banares. Other sinners will be fried in burning pits of live coals after death. Therefore,\neverybody should try to live at Banares which is My Pranalinga Itself.\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm!

    "Rudraksha": "\nRudraksha Jabala Upanishad\nOm ! Let my limbs and speech, Prana, eyes, ears, vitality\nAnd all the senses grow in strength.\nAll existence is the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nMay I never deny Brahman, nor Brahman deny me.\nLet there be no denial at all:\nLet there be no denial at least from me.\nMay the virtues that are proclaimed in the Upanishads be in me,\nWho am devoted to the Atman; may they reside in me.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHail Om! I praise the Effulgent State of Absolute Peace, belonging to Sri Maharudra, which is to be\nknown through the Rudraksha Jabala Upanishad.\nBhusunda questioned Lord Kalagnirudra: What is the beginning of Rudraksha beads? What is the\nbenefit of wearing them on the body?\nLord Kalagnirudra answered him thus: I closed my eyes for the sake of destroying the Tripura Asuras.\nFrom my eyes thus closed, drops of water fell on the earth. These drops of tears turned into\nRudrakshas.\nBy the mere utterance of the name of \u2018Rudraksha\u2019, one acquires the benefit of giving ten cows in\ncharity. By seeing and touching it, one attains double that benefit. I am unable to praise it any more.\nI closed my eyes one thousand celestial years. Then from my eyelids, drops of water dropped down and\nattained the state of immobility for blessing the devoted persons.\nThis Rudraksha destroys the devotees\u2019 sins that are committed both night and day, by wearing it.\nBy mere vision of the Rudraksha, the benefit will be say, a lac. But by wearing them, it will be a crore.\nWhy, it will be equal to hundred crores.\nBut it will be a thousand lacs of crores and hundred lacs of crores times powerful when one does Japa\nwith Rudraksha and wears it at all times.\nAmong Rudrakshas, one as big as Amalaka (myrobalan), is considered to be the best. One as big as the\n\nBadari fruit (Indian berry) is considered to be of the middle sort. But that as big as Chana (Bengal\ngram) is considered to be the worst of all. This is my idea about the size of Rudraksha beads.\nThe four kinds of people, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras are born as merely a worthless\nburden on the earth. The real Brahmin is the white Rudraksha. The red is a Kshatriya. The yellow is a\nVaisya. And the black is a Sudra.\nTherefore, a Brahmin should wear white Rudrakshas, a Kshatriya the red, a Vaisya the yellow and a\nSudra the black.\nOne should use those Rudraksha-beads which are nice, handsome, strong, big, auspicious and thorny.\nOne should avoid those eaten by worms, broken, without thorns, and having sores.\nThe self-holed Rudraksha is of the best variety. But that which is holed by man\u2019s attempt, is considered\nto be worse. Those best Rudrakshas should be strung in white thread. A worshipper of Siva should wear\nRudraksha all over the body. He should wear one bead on the crest, three hundred round the head,\nthirty-six round the neck, sixteen round each arm, twelve round the chest and five hundred round the\nwaist. He should wear a Yajnopavita consisting of one hundred and eight beads of Rudrakshas. He\nshould wear two, three, five or seven Malas of Rudraksha round the neck.\nA Siva-Bhakta should wear Rudrakshas round his crown, ear-ring, chain, round the ear, armlet, at all\ntimes, and specially round the stomach, irrespective of the fact whether he is sleeping, drinking, etc.\nIf the devotee wears three hundred beads, it is the worst, if he wears five hundred it will be medium,\nbut one thousand will be the best of all.\nThe devotee, when wearing Rudrakshas on the head, should repeat his Ishta Mantra, and when wearing\nthem round the neck, should repeat the Tat-Purusha Mantra and when wearing round the throat, should\nrepeat the Aghora Mantra. The same Mantra (Aghora) should be recited when wearing round the chest\nalso.\nHe should wear them round the arms with the Aghora Bija Mantra.\nThen again Bhusunda asked Lord Kalagnirudra: What are the different forms and effects of Rudraksha\nbeads? Please tell me about the secret of these blessed ones including their various faces, which is the\nmeans of getting rid of all evil.\nLord Kalagnirudra said: The bead with one face is of the form of the Supreme Truth. A disciplined one\n(controlling his senses) mingles himself with the one Eternal Truth, after wearing these Rudrakshas.\nThe bead with two faces is of the form of Ardhanarisvara and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of\nArdhanarisvara (Siva united with Sakti). The bead with three faces is of the form of the three fires and\nthe devotee wearing it attains the grace of Agni. The bead with four faces is of the form of the fourfaced Brahma and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of Brahma. The bead with five faces is of the\nform of Panchabrahman (the five-faced Siva) and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of\nPanchabrahman and drives away the sin of homicide. The bead with six faces is of the form of the sixfaced Kartikeya or Ganesha and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of wealth and health, clear\nintellect and wisdom, and purification. The bead with seven faces is of the form of the seven Matras\n(Mother Goddesses) and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of wealth and health, right perception,\nand purity of mind. The bead with eight faces is of the form of the eight-fold Nature (five elements,\nmind, ego, and matter) or the eight Vasus and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of these Devatas\nand becomes truthful. The bead with nine faces is of the form of the Nava-Saktis and the devotee\nwearing it attains the grace of the nine Powers. The bead with ten faces is of the form of the ten Yamas\nmeans used by Yogins and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of achieving peace of the mind. The\nbead with eleven faces is of the form of the eleven Rudras and the devotee wearing it attains the grace\nof increase well-being and wealth. The bead with twelve faces is of the form of Mahavishnu or the\ntwelve Adityas and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of Moksha. The bead with thirteen faces is\nof the form of the Kama (Cupid or the god of Love) and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of\nCupid in gratifying all desires. The bead with fourteen faces is of the form of Rudra being generated\nout of his eyes and the devotee wearing it attains the grace of destruction of all diseases.\n\nOne who wears Rudrakshas, should not use intoxicants, meat, garlic, onions, carrots and all such\nprohibited things. By wearing Rudrakshas during eclipses, Vishusankranti (the end of Mina and\nbeginning of Mesha Masa), new moon, full moon and other such auspicious days, one is freed of all\nsins.\nThe base of the Rudraksha bead is Brahma, its navel is Vishnu, its face is Rudra and its hole consists of\nall gods.\nOne day Sanatkumara asked Kalagnirudra: \u201cO Lord! Tell me the rules for wearing Rudrakshas\u201d. At that\ntime Nidagha, Jadabharata, Dattatreya, Katyayana, Bharadvaja, Kapila, Vasishtha, Pippalada, etc.,\ncame to Kalagnirudra. Then Lord Kalagnirudra asked them why they all had come in a group. They all\nanswered that they came to hear the method of wearing Rudrakshas.\nKalagnirudra said: Those that are born out of Rudra\u2019s Akshis (eyes) are called Rudrakshas. When these\nbeads are even once touched by hand, one attains the glory of giving in charity two thousand cows at a\ntime. When they are worn in ears, he gets the effect of giving out eleven thousand cows in charity. He\nalso attains the state of the eleven Rudras. When the beads are worn on the head, one has the benefit of\ngiving a crore of cows in charity. Of all these places, I am unable to tell you the benefit when worn in\nthe ears.\nWhoever studies this Rudraksha Jabala Upanishad, be he a boy or a youth, becomes great. He becomes\nthe Guru of all and the teacher of all Mantras. Havan and Archana should be done with these Mantras\n(of the Upanishad).\nThat Brahmin who recites this Upanishad in the evening, destroys the sins committed during day time;\nwho recites at noon, destroys the sins of six births; who recites in the morning and evening, destroys\nthe sins of many births. He attains the same benefit of doing six thousand lacs of Gayatri Japa.\nHe becomes purified from all sins of killing a Brahmin, drinking toddy, stealing gold, approaching\nGuru\u2019s wife, having intercourse with her, speaking with corrupted person, etc.\nHe gets the benefits of all pilgrimages and river-baths. He attains Siva-sayujya. He does not come back\n(to rebirth).\nOm ! Let my limbs and speech, Prana, eyes, ears, vitality\nAnd all the senses grow in strength.\nAll existence is the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nMay I never deny Brahman, nor Brahman deny me.\nLet there be no denial at all:\nLet there be no denial at least from me.\nMay the virtues that are proclaimed in the Upanishads be in me,\nWho am devoted to the Atman; may they reside in me.\nOm !

Sankrithi\nis a great devotee and a sage and is an expert in yoga and also a disciple of Dattatreya. He approached\nhis teacher (God Dattatreya) with humility and with folded hands, when his teacher was alone and\nrequested him, \u201cOh God, please tell me about the science of yoga which has eight branches and five\ndifferent sthanas (places) by knowing which I will attain salvation. Dattatreya told him, \u201cHey Sankrithi,\nI shall tell you about Yoga which has eight branches. The eight branches are Yama, Niyama, Aasana,\nPranayama, Prathyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi.\nYama which is the first is the practice of non-violence, truth, non possession of properties of others,\ncelibacy, mercy, honesty, patience, stability, food discipline and cleanliness. 1\nNiyama is the ten aspects of penance, joy, orthodoxy, charity, worship of god, hearing of philosophy,\nfear for bad actions, clear intellect, chanting and austerities. 2\nThe nine important Asanas (sitting positions) are Swasthika (Swastika), Gomukha (cows face), Padma\n\n(lotus), Veera (valorous), Simha (lion), Badra (safe), Muktha (free), Mayura (peacock) and Sukha\n(pleasant). Oh sage, that position, whatever it may be but which makes you comfortable and gives you\ncourage to undertake Yoga is called Sukhasana. People who do not have strength to take up other\npositions can use that. Victory in the seating position is like victory over the three worlds. Once the\nAsana is fixed, one should practice Pranayama. 3\nEither in the top of the mountain or by the shore of the river or under a Bilwa tree in the forest, after\nchoosing a clean place which is acceptable to the mind and after establishing a place to do tapas\n(Asram), sit in the Asana which is most familiar facing either east or north. Then sit with the body neck\nand head in a straight line, cover the face and concentrate the vision with best possible attention on the\nnectar flowing from the fourth state of the moon like dot at the end of the nose. Draw the air inside\nusing the lungs, store it in the stomach, meditate on the flame of fire inside the body and then shift\nmeditation to the root of fire with its sound and dot. Then the intelligent one will exhale and draw the\nPrana using Pingala (Nadi which is tawny and is on the right side of Sushumna Nadi) and meditate on\nthe Agni Bheeja. Again he has to exhale and inhale again in the middle using the Ida (Nadi which is\npleasant and is on the left side of Sushumna). One should have to live in a secret place practicing this\nexercise six times for 3-4 days or 3-4 weeks at dawn, noon and dusk. This would help him to clean up\nthe Nadis. Slowly symbols will start showing up. Body will become light, the fire in the stomach will\nburn well and the voice would become clearer. These are the symbols of Siddhi (getting mastery). Till\nyou see this, you have to practice. 4\nNow I will tell you about Prathyahara. To use force and divert the sensory organs which normally travel\naccording to their nature is Prathyahara. Those who know Brahma say that seeing whatever we see as\nthe form of Brahman is Prathyahara. Prathyahara also is doing clean or unclean acts as those belonging\nto Brhaman. Further doing daily religious activities after dedicating them to God and similarly doing\nthe activities which we desire is also Prathyahara. Apart from this inhaling air (oxygen) and stopping it\nin different places is also Prathyahara. The wise man would sit in Swasthikasana, draw his breath till it\nfills up from head to toe and hold it in two feet, mooladhara, stomach, middle of the heart, bottom of\nthe neck, jaw, middle of the eyelids, forehead and at the top of the skull. Then he should leave out the\nbelief that the body is oneself and make that thought as nirvikalpa and merge it with Paramatma. The\nexperts in Vedanta say that this is true Prathyahara. There is nothing that cannot be attained by those\nwho practice like this. 5\nNow I will tell you about the five types of Dharana (holding steady - a stage in meditation - here we try\nto hold on what we are mediating upon without wavering). In the sky which is in the middle of the\nbody, Dharana of the sky outside should be made. Similarly in the breath, Dharana of air outside should\nbe made. In the fire in the stomach, Dharana of the fire outside should be made. In the fluid aspects of\nthe body, Dharana of the water outside should be made. In the earthy aspects of the body, Dharana of\nthe earth outside should be made. Sage, also it is necessary to chant the pancha bhootha mantras viz.,\nHam, Yam, Ram, Vam and Lam. It is said that this very great Dharana destroys all sins. In the body up\nto the knee is the aspect of the earth, from there till hip it is the aspect of water, up to the heart is the\naspect of fire, up to middle of eyelids is the aspect of air and then up to the middle of the skull is the\naspect of the sky. In the aspect of earth Brahma has to be placed, in the aspect of water Vishnu should\nbe placed, in the aspect of fire Rudra should be placed, in the aspect of air Iswara should be placed and\nin the aspect of sky, the Sadashiva should be placed. Hey great sage, I will also tell you another\nDharana. In the Jeevatma, that lord Shiva who rules over everything and is the personification of\nwisdom should be placed. To get rid of all sins, the wise man should suppress the gods like Brahma in\nthe causative self, and place the Avyakta (that which is not clear) which is formless and which is the\nroot cause inside the entire soul with the chanting of pranava. He should control the sensory organs by\n\nmind and should merge them with the soul. 6\nI will now tell you about Dhyana (meditation) which destroys sorrow. Dhyana should be done of that\nMaheswara, who is the medicine for problems arising out of birth, who is the discipline and\nfundamental basis of the world who is of the form of Para Brahma, who has the masculine power\nupwards, who is of the form of the world, who is Virupaksha, and who is the head of all yogis as \u201cI am\nHe\u201d. Then continue to do Dhyana of him who is beyond the reach of meditation, who is the\npersonification of Sachidananda Brahman and who is soul in person as \u201cI am He\u201d for attaining\nsalvation. In the mind of that great Purusha who practices like this, the science of Vedanta would\nautomatically appear. There is no doubt about it. 7\nNow I will tell you about Samadhi (deep meditative state) which destroys the ills of birth and death.\nSamadhi is that state in which there is knowledge that Jeevatma and Paramatma are one. Atma (soul) is\nfilled all over for ever and does not have motion or stain. Though it is one, due to the effects of illusion,\nit appears as different objects. Really there is no difference between these so called objects. When one\nsees all objects within himself and him as a part of all objects, He attains Brahman. When one drowns\nhimself in Samadhi and does not see different objects as different , then he attains the single aim of\nsalvation. When he sees only the true soul and the entire world appears as an illusion to him and he is\ncured of all sorrow.\nThus advised by Lord Dattatreya the sage Sankrithi fully lost all his fear and attained that blissfull state,\ndeep in himself.\nOm !

Brihaspati asked Yajnavalkya: \u201cThat which is called Kurukshetra is the place of the\nsacrifice of the Devas and the spiritual seat of all beings. Therefore where should one go in order that\nhe may cognise Kurukshetra, the place of the sacrifice of the Devas and the spiritual seat of all\nbeings ?\u201d (To which Yajnavalkya replied): \u201cAvimukta is Kurukshetra, the place of the sacrifice of the\nDevas and of the study of Brahman, because it is there that Rudra initiates one into the Taraka Brahman\nwhen Prana (life) goes out. Through this, one becomes immortal and the enjoyer of Moksha. Therefore\none should always be in the midst of that place Avimukta and should never leave, O Reverend Sir,\nAvimukta.\u201d Thus said Yajnavalkya.\n2. Then Bharadvaja asked Yajnavalkya: \u201cWhat is Taraka ? What is that which causes one to cross (this\nmundane existence)\u201d. To which Yajnavalkya replied: \u201cOm Namo Narayanaya is the Taraka. It should\nbe worshipped as Chidatma. Om is a single syllable and of the nature of Atman. Namah is of two\nsyllables and is of the nature of Prakriti (matter). Narayanaya is of five syllables and is of the nature of\nParabrahman. He who knows this becomes immortal. Through \u2018Om\u2019, is Brahma produced; through\n\u2018Na\u2019 is Vishnu produced; through \u2018Ma\u2019 is Rudra produced; through \u2018Na\u2019 is Ishvara produced; through\n\u2018Ra\u2019 is the Anda-Virat (or Virat of the universe) produced; through \u2018Ya\u2019 is Purusha produced; through\n\u2018Na\u2019 is Bhagavan (Lord) produced; and through \u2018Ya\u2019 is Paramatman produced. This Ashtakshara (eight\nsyllables) of Narayana is the supreme and the highest Purusha. Thus is the Rig-Veda with the first foot\n(or half).\n\nCHAPTER - II\nThat which is Om is the indestructible, the supreme and Brahman. That alone should be worshipped. It\nis this that is of the eight subtle syllables. And this becomes eight, being of eight forms. \u2018A\u2019 is the first\nletter; \u2018U\u2019 is the second; \u2018M\u2019 is the third; Bindu is the fourth; Nada is the fifth; Kala is the sixth;\nKalatita (that beyond Kala) is the seventh; and that which is beyond these is the eighth. It is called\nTaraka, because it enables one to cross this mundane existence. Know that Taraka alone is Brahman\nand it alone should be worshipped\u201d. The (following) verses may be quoted here:\n1. \u201cFrom the letter \u2018A\u2019 came Brahma named Jambavan (the bear). From the letter \u2018U\u2019 came Upendra,\nnamed Hari.\n2. From the letter \u2018M\u2019 came Shiva, known as Hanuman. Bindu is named Ishvara and is Satrughna, the\nLord of the discuss itself.\n3. Nada should be known as the great Lord named Bharata and the sound of the conch itself. From Kala\ncame the Purusha himself as Lakshmana and the bearer of the earth.\n4. Kalatita is known as the goddess Sita Herself. That which is beyond is the Paramatman named Sri\nRama and is the highest Purusha.\nAll this is the explanation of the letter Om, which is the past, the present and future and which is other\nthan these (viz.,) Tattva, Mantra, Varna (colour), Devata (deity), Chhandas (metre), Rik, Kala, Sakti and\nSrishti (creation). He who knows this becomes immortal. (Thus is) Yajur-Veda with the second foot\u201d.\nCHAPTER - III\nThen Bharadvaja asked Yajnavalkya: \u201cThrough what Mantra is Paramatman pleased and shows his own\nAtman (to persons) ? Please tell this\u201d. Yajnavalkya replied:\n1. Om. He who is Sri-Paramatman, Narayana and the Lord described by (the letter) \u2018A\u2019 and is\nJambavan (the bear) and Bhuh, Bhuvah and Suvah; Salutation to Him !\n2. Om. He who is Sri-Paramatman, Narayana and the Lord described by (the letter) \u2018U\u2019 and is Upendra\n(or) Hari and Bhuh, Bhuvah and Suvah; Salutation to Him !\n3. Om. He who is Sri-Paramatman, Narayana and the Lord described by (the letter) \u2018M\u2019 and is of the\nform of Shiva (or) Hanuman and Bhuh, Bhuvah and Suvah; Salutation to Him !\n4. Om. He who is Sri-Paramatman, Narayana, the Lord of Satrughna of the form of Bindu and the\nBhuh, Bhuvah and Suvah; Salutation to Him !\n5. Om. He who is Sri-Paramatman, Narayana and the Lord, and is Bharata of the form of Nada and the\nBhuh, Bhuvah and Suvah; Salutation to Him !\n6. Om. He who is Sri-Paramatman, Narayana and the Lord, and is Lakshmana of the form of Kala and\nthe Bhuh, Bhuvah and Suvah; Salutation to Him !\n7. Om. He who is Sri-Paramatman, Narayana and the Lord, and is Kalatita, the Goddess Sita, of the\nform of Chit and the Bhuh, Bhuvah and Suvah; Salutation to Him !\n8. Om. He who is Sri-Paramatman, Narayana and the Lord that is beyond that (Kalatita), is the supreme\nPurusha and is the ancient Purushottama, the eternal, the immaculate, the enlightened, the emancipated,\nthe true, the highest bliss, the endless, the secondless and the all-full \u2013 that Brahman is myself. I am\nRama and the Bhuh, Bhuvah and Suvah; Salutation to Him !\nHe who has mastered this eightfold Mantra is purified by Agni; he is purified by Vayu; he is purified by\nthe sun; he is purified by Shiva; he is known by all the Devas. He attains the fruit of reciting Itihasas,\nPuranas, Rudra (Mantras), a hundred thousand times. He who repeatedly remembers (or recites) the\nAshtakshara (the eight-syllabled Mantra) of Narayana gains the fruit of the recitation of Gayatri a\nhundred thousand times or of Pranava (Om) a myriad of times. He purifies (his ancestors) ten (degrees)\nabove and (his descendants) ten (degrees) below. He attains the state of Narayana. He who knows this\n(attains) the state of Narayana).\nLike the eye (which sees without any obstacle) the things spread (in the sky), the wise ever see this\nsupreme seat of Vishnu. Brahmanas who are spiritually awake praise in diverse ways and illuminate the\n\nsupreme abode of Vishnu. Thus is the Upanishad. (Thus is) the Sama-Veda with the third foot. Hari Om\nTat Sat !\nOm !

The personal knowledge \u201cthat this Sun is\nBrahman\u201d is got by chanting Ajabha Gayatri viz., \u201cHamsa Soham.\u201d The ever joyous Paramatma would\nset in if, after controlling Prana and Apana by Pranayama, and attaining it (pranayama) by constant and\nlong practice of Pooraka and Rechaka (macro, micro as well as together) and making the mind\nconcentrate on the same Brahman in three stages. It would shine like one thousand suns and would be\ncomplete like the shoreless sea. That experience is neither Samadhi nor Yoga Sidhi and nor mixing of\nthe mind. That is merging with Brahman as Brahman is always single.\nThe sages who experience this tell as follows: I know that Purusha with the shining light who is beyond\ndarkness, who makes shapes, who names them, who provides for them and who is the brave\nPurushotama. The one who finds out that Purusha, who was announced as Para Brahman by Brahma in\nthe primitive times and who was found out by Indra in all the four directions, attains the deathless state\nin this birth itself. There is no other method for salvation.\n\nI am that sun who is the ethereal light. I am that Siva who is that sun of Knowledge. I am the very clean\nlight of Atma. I am all the light that we know.

Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nSage Pippalada asked Lord Ishwara, \u201cOh, God, Which appeared first?\u201d\nFor which, the Lord Maheswara replied:\nThe Para Brahma took shape in stages of Sathyojatha, Aghora, Vamadeva, Thathpurusha and Ishana. 1\nSathyojatha is the aspect of earth and is the Sun, Goddess Lakshmi, Brahma, the letter Om, Rig Veda,\nGarhapathyagni (Household fire), mantras, Saptha Swaras (seven notes) and yellow colour. It gives all\nthat is wished for. 2\nAghora is the aspect of water and is moon, Goddess Parvathy, Yajur Veda, blue colour of the cloud,\nDakshinagni (the fire of the south) and fifty letters. It drives away all sins, destroys all that is evil and\ngrants riches. 3\nVamadeva gives great knowledge and destroys all sins. It is the aspect of fire, is lights of crores of suns,\nSama Veda, eight type of songs, courageous tone, Ahwaneeyagni, power of knowledge, power to\ndestroy and slightly blackish white colour. It gives full consciousness, rules over all the three worlds,\nspread over all the three worlds and grants all sort of luck and results for the action performed. 4\n\nThathpurusha is with eight letters (Aa, Ka, Cha, Ta, Tha, Pa, Ya, Sa) and is in the eight petal lotus and\nis normally surrounded by air. It has five fires, protects effects of mantras, personification of the fifty\nconsonants, has the form of Atharva Veda, is the chief of several crores of Ganas, has the shape which\nis extremely big, red coloured, gives whatever is asked for, medicine for worry and diseases and the\nroot of Srishti (creation), Sthithi (upkeep) and Laya(merging). It is the basis of all strengths. It is the\nThureeya which is beyond the three common states and is the thing called Brahman. It is worshipped\nby Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu. It is the philosophy from which all others originate. 5\nYou should understand that Ishana is the witness for intelligence and is the activator of the brain. It is\nthe aspect of sky and cannot be seen. It is decorated by the sound of \u201cOm\u201d. It has the shape of all\ndevas. It is peaceful. It is beyond peace. It is beyond sound. It is Aa and occupies the headship of\nvowels. It is the form of Pancha Brahma which is everywhere and activates the five actions of creation,\nupkeep, destruction, disappearance and blessing. It hides the Pancha Brahmas within itself and exists as\nitself and shines beyond the Pancha Brahmas by its light. It shines in the beginning, middle and end\nwithout any causative reason. All those devas who are all under stupor by the illusion of Maheswara\nwould not understand properly that Mahadeva who is the teacher of the universe, is the cause of all\ncauses. His shape does not appear before the eye. This world is shining because of that Parathpara\nPurusha in whom the world exists. It merges in him. That Ishana aspect is the Para Brahman which is\nthe upper boundary of peace. The knowledge that the Para Brhaman is oneself and the rise of Sathyo\nJatam (birth of truth) is Para Brahman. Whichever is seen or heard is the soul of Para Brahman. 6\nThe existence in five shapes is called Brahma Karya (activity). After understanding Brahma Karya,\nIshana is appreciated. After putting the fact all that is originating from Para Brahman in ones soul, the\nwise man experiences and understands that \u201cIt is me\u201d and becomes Brahman as well as deathless.\nThere is no doubt that the one who understands this Brahman becomes freed (emancipated).\nOne should chant the Panchakshara Mantra which is from Na to Ya (Namasivaya) and which is of the\nshape of five letters and is Lord Shiva\u2019s body. After understanding the philosophy of the soul of Pancha\nBrahma, One should understand that every form is the form of those five. One who studies this\nknowledge of the soul of the Pancha Brahma would shine himself as Pancha Brahma. This Upanishad\ntells that Lord Shiva, who grants salvation to one, from this day- to-day life of the world, exists as\nwitness without differentiation in the heart of all beings and is called Hrudayam (That which exists\nwithin).\nOm !

According to proper procedure, setting (the cooked) rice on the ground one intones the three verses\nbeginning with \u2018Ya osadhaya \u2026\u2019 and the two beginning with \u2018annapate ..\u2019.\n3. The many plants of hundred shapes and forms that Soma rules asking, urged on by Brihaspati, ye\ndeliver us from calamities.\n4. The fruitful plants and fruitless, that have flowers and the flowerless, urged on by Brihaspati, ye\ndeliver us from calamities.\n5. Let me not bind for you the plants that live and endow (others with) life, that are free from\nmalignancy; may they put to fight the evil spirits from one who offers them (sacrifice).\n6. Lord of food ! Give us food that is clean and rich in energy; help the giver of food over (the hazards\nof life). Endow us, bipeds and quadrupeds, with might.\n7. May the food (we eat) be fire; (though) it is adverse to the Rudras and the evil spirits and may it\npromote generations of off-spring. Let the mighty (Lord) purge it of all seeds of fear and make it\nauspicious. Hail to the mighty Lord.\n8. Seeing all you move within the hidden (places). You are the sacrifice; You are Brahma, Rudra,\nVishnu. You are the sacred syllable Vasat, light, taste, the immortal Brahman, the earth, the mid-region\nand the firmament. OM Salutation.\n\n9. May the waters purify the earth; may the purified earth purify me. May (the waters) purify the master\nof the Veda; may the hallowed Vedic essence purify me. Whatever is left over as unfit to be consumed\nor whatever deed of mine be sinful \u2013 all these may the waters purify; also the gifts (accepted from) the\nunrighteous. Hail !\n10. You are ambrosia; an ambrosial spread (base). You are ambrosia in regard to the vital breath; fit for\nthe sacred offering, the last blessing. OM, salutation to Prana. OM, salutation to Apana. OM, salutation\nto Vyana. OM, salutation to Udana. OM, salutation to Samana. OM, salutation to Brahman. OM, may\nmyself be in Brahman for the winning of immortality.\n11. The offering to Prana is made with the little finger and the thumb. With the ring finger and the\nthumb is made the offering to Apana. With the middle finger and the thumb is made that to Vyana, with\nall fingers is the offering made to Udana and with the forefinger and the thumb is made the offering to\nSamana.\n12. Silently one offering is made with one Ric; two in the Ahavaniya; one in the Dakshina fire; one in\nthe Garhapatya and one in the fire for all expiatory rites.\n13. Then, \u2018You are the lid for immortality\u2019 \u2013 for winning immortality. Sipping one must take again and\ntouch again.\n14. Taking water in the right palm and holding it over against the heart one should intone: Prana is fire;\nis the supreme Self surrounded by the five vital breaths. Fearlessness to all living beings ! Fear never\ndwells in me\n15. You (Prana) are Vishva and Vaishvanara; by you is the multiform world sustained as it manifests\nitself. Where you are, the immortal Brahma, are all offerings (made).\n16. This great and novel Spirit (is) established at the ends of the big toes. I pour water round him at the\nend (of the ceremonial eating) for winning immortality.\n17. Let this external self meditate on specific activities \u2013 thus one makes offerings in the fire. Let (the\nperformer) be a son to all. The ritual offerings are consecrated in the fire.\n18. I shall perform sacrifice in my body. There are the four fires, no mean ones, corresponding to the\nfour parts of OM with the half syllable.\n19. There is no solar fire, shaped like the solar disc, sheathed in a thousand rays, abiding in the crown\nas the solar seer. The fire of vision mentioned (above) with its four forms, becoming the Ahavaniya is\nstationed in the mouth. The bodily fire consumes the oblations that destroy old age. Becoming\nDakshinagni, shaped like a half moon, it is stationed in the heart. Then, there is the gastric fire that,\nbecoming Garhapatya is stationed at the navel consuming what is eaten, drunk, licked and sucked.\n20. Underneath are the three horizontal states of mind \u2013 the moon, Lord and the agent of generation.\n21. In this bodily sacrifice, unadorned by the girdle round the sacrificial post, who is the sacrificer ?\nWho is (his) wife ? Who are the officiating priests ? Who are the attendants ? Which are the sacrificial\nvessels ? What are the oblations ? Which is the altar ? Which is the interior of the altar ? Which is the\nwooden container (for the soma juice) ? Which is the chariot ?

Which is the sacrificial post ? Which is the\ncord ? Which are the Ishtis (oblations of butter, fruits, etc.,) ? What is the sacrificial fee ? What is the\nritual bath after the sacrifice ?\n22. In the bodily sacrifice, unadorned by the cord round the sacrificial post, the sacrificer is the self;\n(his) wife is the intellect. The great officiating priests are the Vedas. The ego is the Adhvaryu. The\nmind-stuff is the invoking priest. Prana is the assistant of the chief priest; Apana is the assistant of the\n\nAdhvaryu. Vyana is the first chanter. Udana is the loud Sama singer. Samana is the assistant of Hotir.\nThe body is the altar. The nose is the interior of the altar. The crest is the wooden container. The foot is\nthe chariot. The right hand is the ladle. The left hand is the container of the ghee. The ears are the two\nghee offerings. The eyes are the two parts of the ghee. The neck is the libation. The Tanmatras are the\nassistant of the Brahma Priest. The great elements are the attendants. Gunas are the supplementary\nofferings. The tongue is the final sacrifices. Teeth and lips are the middle libation. The palate is the\nhymn-recitation. Memory is the Samyorvaka formula. Compassion, forbearance, non-violence are the\nfour Ajya oblations (to Soma, etc.,). Om is the sacrificial post. Desire is the cord. Mind is the chariot.\nLust is the sacrificial animal. The hair is the Darbha grass. The sense organs are the sacrificial vessels.\nThe organs of action are the oblations. Non-violence is the Ishtis. Renunciation is the sacrificial fee.\nThe post-sacrificial bath (follows) from death. In this body are stationed all the divinities.\n23. (Either) one dies in Benares (or) the Brahmana who reads this (Upanishad) achieves liberation in\none life: This is the secret doctrine.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Pranagnihotropanishad belonging to the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Gopalatapini": "\nGopala-Tapaniya Upanishad\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nChapter One\n1. Om namah. I offer my respectful obeisances to Sri Krishna, whose form is eternal and full of\nknowledge and bliss, who is the rescuer from distress, who is understood by Vedanta, who is the\nsupreme spiritual master, and who is the witness in everyone\u2019s heart.\n2. Om. Some sages said to the demigod Brahma: \u201cWho is the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Whom\ndoes death fear? By knowing whom does everything else become known? Who created this world.\n3. Brahma replied to them: \u201cKrishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Death fears Govinda. By\nunderstanding Gopijanavallabha everything becomes known. By pronouncing the word \u201csvaha\u201d the\nPersonality of Godhead created the world.\n4. They then said: \u201cWho is Krishna? Who is Govinda? Who is Gopijanavallabha? What is Svaha?\u201d\n5. To them Brahma said: \u201cKrishna means He who delivers from sin, Govinda means He who is famous\non the earth, in the Vedas, and among the surabhi cows, Gopijanavallabha means He who enchants the\ngopis, and Svaha means the potency of the Supreme. All these names refer to the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead.\n6. One who meditates on this Supreme Personality of Godhead, glorifies Him, and worships Him,\nbecomes liberated. He becomes liberated.\n7. They said: What is His form? What is His glorification? How does one worship Him? Please\n\ndescribe this to us\n8-9. Brahma said: He appears like a cowherd boy. His complexion is like a monsoon cloud. He stays\nunder a desire-tree. The following verses describe Him.\n10. Meditating with all his heart on Lord Krishna, whose eyes are handsome lotus flowers, whose\ncomplexion is a monsoon cloud, whose garments are lightning, who has two arms, who is rich in\ntranscendental knowledge, who wears a garland of forest flowers, who is the supreme controller, who is\nsurrounded by gopas, gopis, and surabhi cows, who rests under a sura-druma tree, who is decorated\nwith splendid ornaments, who stands in the middle of a red lotus flower, and who is served by breezes\nthat have touched the Yamuna\u2019s waves, a person becomes free from repeated birth and death.\n11. This mantra should be repeatedly chanted: \u201cklim krishnaya govindaya gopijanavallabhaya svaha\u201d.\n12. By chanting these five names one attains the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose potencies are\nmanifested as the heavenly planets, the earth, sun, moon, and fire.\n13. A person who even once chants the mantra \u201cKlim krsnaya govindaya gopijanavallabha svaha\u201d\nquickly attains the association of Lord Krishna. He does not attain any other result.\n14. Devotional service to Lord Krishna is performed when the heart no longer desires any material\nbenefit to be obtained in this life or the next. This is freedom from the bonds of karma.\n15. Many brahmanas worship Krishna. Many worship eternal Govinda. Gopijanavallabha maintains the\nworlds. Powerful Svaha moves the universe.\n16. Although originally one, air becomes the five life-airs in the bodies of all living entities. In the same\nway, for the benefit of the world Lord Krishna appears as these five words.\n17. They said: Please describe the worship of Govinda, the Supersoul, who maintains everything.\n18. Brahma said: The Lord\u2019s altar should be a golden lotus with eight petals. Within that lotus should\nbe placed two triangles and the mantra klim krsnaya namah, the Kama-gayatri (klim krsnaya govindaya\ngopijanavallabhaya svaha), and the ananga-gayatri (kamadevaya sarva-jana-priyaya sarva-janasammohanaya jvala jvala prajvala prajvala sarva-janasya hrdayam me vasam kuru kuru svaha) should\nbe written there. then anga should be offered with the sula-matra (astraya phat). Then one should\nworship the Lord\u2019s expansions, beginning with Rukmini, the devotees headed by Indra, the devotees\nheaded by King Vasudeva, the devotees headed by Arjuna, and the devotees headed by Indranidhi.\n19. He who at sunrise, noon and sunset, makes various offerings to the Deity, obtains everything. He\nobtains everything.\n20. In this matter there are the following verses: Lord Krishna is the worshipable, all-pervading\nsupreme controller, and although He is one, He manifests in many forms. They who are intelligent\nworship Him as He stands on His altar. They, and not others, attain eternal happiness.\n21. The brahmanas, who worship, as He stands on His altar, the one greatest among the eternals and\ngreatest among conscious persons, the one who fulfils the desires of the many, they, and not others,\nattain perfection.\n22. To they who always diligently worship Lord Visnu\u2019s transcendental form, the Lord, in His original\nform as a cowherd boy, shows His lotus feet.\n23. It was Krishna who in the beginning instructed Brahma in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated\nVedic knowledge in the past. They who desire liberation surrender to Him, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, who grants transcendental knowledge to His devotees.\n24. To they who chant the five-word mantra with om and govinda (om krsnaya govindaya\ngopijanavallabha svaha) the Lord reveals His own form. Therefore, to attain transcendental peace, they\nwho desire liberation should regularly chant this mantra.\n25. From this five-word mantra have come all other govinda-mantras in human society, including the\nten-syllable govinda-mantra chanted by Indra\u2019s followers and by they who desire opulences.\n26. They asked: Please tell us the nature of this mantra.\n27-28. Brahma said: I continually glorified the Lord and meditated upon Him for millions of years, and\nat last I was able to understand the transcendental form of the Lord as Sri Krishna, in the dress of a\n\ncowherd boy. With devotion in my heart I bowed down before Him. He gave me the eighteen-syllable\nmantra to be used for the activity of creation, and then He disappeared.\n29. When I desired to create the universe He again appeared before me, showing me in these syllables\nthe universe that was to be.\n30. From the letter k, I created water, from the letter l, earth, from the letter i, fire, from the letter m, the\nmoon, and from the entire word klim, the sun. From the word krsnaya, I created ether, from govindaya,\nair, from gopijanavallabha, knowledge and the surabhi cows, and from svaha, men, women, and\neverything else. Everything else.\n31. By worshipping Him, Shiva became free from illusion, and by chanting this mantra in a solitary\nplace, he attained the Lord.\n32. The demigods gaze at Visnu\u2019s abode, which is like a splendid sun in the sky.\n33. Therefore one should regularly chant this mantra. One should regularly chant this mantra.\n34. Some have said that from the first word of this mantra earth was created, from the second word\nwater, from the third fire, from the fourth air, and from the fifth ether. To attain liberation one should\nchant this five-word Vaishnava mantra, which reveals Lord Krishna.\n35. About this are the following verses: One should chant this mantra, of which from the first word the\nelement earth came, from the second word water, from the third fire, from the fourth air, and from the\nfifth ether.\n36. By chanting this mantra Shiva entered Lord Visnu\u2019s eternal spiritual abode.\n37. That spiritual world, completely pure, uncontaminated, free from suffering, free from greed and all\nother vices, and identical with this five-word mantra, is manifested from Lord Vasudeva. It is not\nseparate from Him.\n38. With eloquent prayers I and the Maruts please Lord Govinda, whose form is eternal and full of\nknowledge and bliss, who stays under a desire tree in Vrndavana, and who is this five-word mantra.\n39. Om namah. To Lord Govinda, who is the form of the universe, the creator. maintainer, and\ndestroyer of the universe, the master of the universe, and the universe itself. I offer my respectful\nobeisances.\n40. Obeisances to Lord Govinda, whose form is full of knowledge, whose form is full of supreme bliss,\nwho is all-attractive, and who is the master of the gopis.\n41. Obeisances to Him, His eyes lotus flowers. Obeisances to Him, garlanded with lotuses. Obeisances\nto Him, His navel a lotus. Obeisances to Him, the husband of the goddesses of fortune.\n42. Obeisances to Lord Govinda, handsome with a peacock-feather crown, identical with Balarama,\nHis intelligence sharp, and He the swan in the Manasa lake of the goddess of fortune\u2019s thoughts.\n43. Obeisances to Him, the death of Kamsa and his allies, the killer of Kesi and Canura, the object of\nworship for Siva, and the chariot-driver of Arjuna.\n44. Obeisances to Him, the cowherd boy fond of playing the flute, the crusher of Kaliya, the person\nwho walks on the Yamuna\u2019s shore and whose earrings gracefully swing to and fro.\n45. Obeisances to Sri Krishna, the protector of the surrendered souls. Obeisances to Him, the expert\ndancer garlanded with the gopi\u2019s lotus glances.\n46. Obeisances to Him, the death of sin, the lifter of Govardhana Hill, the end of Putana\u2019s life, the thief\nof Trnavarta\u2019s life.\n47. Obeisances to Sri Krishna, decorated with a golden necklace, charming, pure, the enemy of\nimpurity, one without a second, the greatest.\n48. Be kind, O blissful one. Be kind, O Supreme Lord. O Lord, please rescue me, bitten by the snake of\nphysical and mental pain.\n49. O Krishna, O husband of Rukmini, O enchanter of the gopis, O master of the universe, please\nrescue me, drowning in the ocean of repeated birth and death.\n50. O Kesava, O Narayana, O Govinda, O Janardana, O source of all transcendental bliss, O Lord who\nrescues the devotees from distress, O Madhava, please rescue me.\n\n51. Brahma said: As I worship Him, so should you. Chanting this five-word mantra, and meditating on\nLord Krishna, you will transcend the world of birth and death.\n52. One who chants this five-word mantra easily attains His transcendental abode.\n53. Although fixed in His abode, the Personality of Godhead is swifter than the mind and can overcome\nall others running. Even the powerful demigods cannot approach Him.\n54. Therefore, Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should meditate upon Him, glorify\nHim, serve Him and worship Him. Om tat sat.\nChapter Two\n1-2. Once, after they had passed the entire night with Him, the passionate girls of Vraja spoke to the\ncowherd boy Krishna, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He also spoke to them.\n3. The gopis said: To what brahmana should charity be given?\n4. Krishna said: Durvasa.\n5. The gopis said: How will we cross the Yamuna\u2019s waters and approach Him, from whom great\nblessings will come?\n6. Krishna said: Say the words Krishna, the brahmacari, and the Yamuna will give you a path.\n7. By remembering Me a shallow person becomes deep. By remembering Me an impure person\nbecomes pure. By remembering Me an impious person becomes pious. By remembering Me one full of\nmaterial desires becomes desireless. By remembering Me a fool becomes learned.\n8. After hearing these words, they meditated on Durvasa, and with these words crossed the Yamuna.\nThey went to the very sacred asrama and bowed down before Durvasa Muni, the best of sages. They\ngave to the brahmana delicious foods made with milk and ghee.\n9. Pleased, he bathed, ate, blessed them, and gave them permission to go.\n10. They said: How will we cross the Yamuna?\n11. He said: Meditate on me as a sage that eats only durva grass, and the Yamuna will give you a path.\n12. Gandharvi (Srimati Radharani), the best among them, reflected for a moment.\n13. She said: How is Krishna a brahmacari? How is this sage a person that eats only durva grass?\n14. Accepting Her as their leader, the other girls became silent.\n15. Durvasa Muni replied: Sound is contained within the element of ether, although sound and ether are\ndifferent. Sound is contained within ether. This ether does not know. I am spirit. How can I be a\nmaterialistic enjoyer.\n16. Touch is contained within the element of air, although touch and air are different. Touch is\ncontained within air. This air does not know. I am spirit. How can I be a materialistic enjoyer?\n17. Form is contained within the element of fire, although form and fire are different. Form is contained\nwithin fire. This fire does not know. I am spirit. How can I be a materialistic enjoyer?\n18. Taste is contained within the element of water, although taste and waste are different. Taste is\ncontained within water. This water does not know. I am spirit. How can I be a materialistic enjoyer?\n19. Aroma is contained within the element of earth, although aroma and earth are different. Aroma is\ncontained within earth. This earth does not know. I am spirit. How can I be a materialistic enjoyer?\n20. It is the mind that remains among the senses and accepts them.\n21. When spirit is everything how does one think? Where does one go? I am spirit, how can I be a\nmaterialistic enjoyer?\n22. Your beloved Krishna is the original creator of the two kinds of bodies.\n23. On the tree of the body are two birds. One is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nHe is a witness. The other is an enjoyer. They are an enjoyer and a non-enjoyer. The first enjoys, and\nthe second is Krishna.\n24. In Him we do not find material so-called knowledge and ignorance. This ignorance and real\nknowledge are different. How can Krishna, who is full of real knowledge, become a materialistic\nenjoyer?\n25-26. He who lusts after pleasure is lusty. He who does not lust after pleasures is not lusty.\n\n27. Krishna, who is free from birth and death, who is unchanging, who cannot be cut, who stays by the\nYamuna, who stays among the surabhi cows, who protects the surabhi cows, who stays among the\ncowherd boys, who stays in all the Vedas, who is glorified by all the Vedas, who has entered all living\nentities, and who controls all living entities, is your husband.\n28. Gandharvi (Radha) said: Why has the Supreme Personality of Godhead taken birth among us as a\ncowherd boy? O sage, how do you know this about Krishna? What is His mantra? What is His abode?\nWhy has He taken birth in Devaki\u2019s womb? Who is His elder brother Balarama? How is He\nworshipped? Why has the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is far above the world of matter,\ndescended to this Earth?\n29. He said: In the beginning only Lord Narayana existed. In Him the material worlds are woven as\nthread on a loom. From His lotus heart the demigod Brahma was born.\n30. When Brahma performed severe austerities, Lord Narayana granted him a boon.\n31. Brahma chose a question.\n32. Lord Narayana granted his request.\n33-34. Brahma said: Among Your many incarnations, which is the best, the one that makes humans and\ndemigods happy, the one that, remembering Him, they become liberated from repeated birth and death?\nWhy is this incarnation the best?\n35. Lord Narayana said:\n36. As on the summit of Mount Meru are seven cities that fulfil all desires, so on the Earth are seven\ncities that fulfil desires and grant liberation. Among them the city of Gopala Puri is directly the spiritual\nworld.\n37. In this city the desires of the demigods and all other creatures are all fulfilled and everyone attains\nliberation.\n38. Protected by My cakra, this city if Mathura, or Gopala Puri, stands in this world as a lotus stands in\na lake.\n39. Gopala Puri contains these forests: 1. the great forest of Brhadvana, 2. Madhuvana, the former\nresidence of the Madhu demon, 3. Talavana, full of palm trees, 4. delightful Kamyavana, 5. great\nBahulavana, 6. Kumudavana, full of lotus flowers and water lilies, 7. Khadiravana, full of Khadira\ntrees, 8. Bhadravana, the favourite spot of Lord Balarama, 9. Bhandiravana, the great forest of Banyan\ntrees, 10. Srivana, the abode of the goddess of fortune, 11. Lohavana, the former residence of the\ndemon Loha, and 12. Vrndavana, ruled by the goddess Vrnda-devi.\n40. In these forests the demigods, human beings, Gandharvas, Nagas, and Kinnaras sing and dance.\n41. The twelve Adityas, eleven Rudras, eight Vasus, seven sages, Brahma, Narada, five Vinayakas,\nViresvara, Rudresvara, Ambikesvara, Ganesvara, Nilakanthesvara, Visvesvara, Gopalesvara,\nBhadresvara, and 24 other lingas reside there.\n42. These forests are divided into two groups: 1. Krishnavana, or Krishna\u2019s forests, and 2.Bhadravana,\nor Balarama\u2019s forests. Among these twelve forests some are sacred and others are most sacred.\n43. There the demigods stay. There the perfect beings attained perfection.\n44. In this place are a Deity of Rama, a Deity of Pradyumna, a Deity of Aniruddha, and a Deity of\nKrishna.\n45. In this way there are twelve Deities in the forests of Mathura.\n46. The Rudras worship the first Deity, Brahma worships the second, Brahma\u2019s sons worship the third,\nThe Maruts worship the fourth, the Vinayakas worship the fifth, the Vasus worship the sixth, the sages\nworship the seventh, the Gandharvas worship the eighth, the Apsaras worship the ninth, the tenth Deity\nis now invisible, the eleventh Deity has gone to His own planet, and the twelfth Deity is now on the\nEarth.\n47. They who worship this Deity surpass death and attain liberation. They cross beyond the three-fold\nmiseries of birth, old-age and death.\n48. There are these verses: Lord Krishna, accompanied by His three potencies, and by Balarama,\n\nAniruddha, Pradyumna, and Rukmini, stays in delightful Mathura Puri, which is worshipped by\nBrahma and the other demigods and protected by the conch, cakra, club, and sarnga bow. These four\nnames are identical with the name Om.\n49. One should think: I am spiritual, beyond material passion. One should think: I am Lord Gopaka\u2019s.\nIn this way one attains liberation. He realizes his spiritual nature. He becomes a knower of spirit.\n50. Because since the beginning of creation He lovingly protects (alati) the conditioned souls (gopa),\nHe is known as Gopala. Om tat sat. I am a spirit. I am a part-and-parcel of Krishna. My spiritual form\nis eternally full of bliss. Om.\n51. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore known as Gopala.\n52. With all one\u2019s heart one should think: I am Gopala\u2019s.\n53. Lord Gopala is unmanifest, limitless, and eternal.\n54. Lord Narayana continued: O Brahma, decorated with a forest-flower garland, and holding a conch,\ndisk, mace and lotus, I will reside eternally in Mathura.\n55. O Brahma, he who with all his heart meditates on Me, whose form is the resting place of all forms,\nwhose form is supremely powerful and splendid, whose form is wonderful, and who has no material\nform, goes to MY abode. Of this there is no doubt.\n56. O Brahma, a resident of this earth planet who remains in the district of Mathura and worships Me\nas I appear in the form of the Deity, becomes very dear to Me.\n57. You should always worship Me as Krishna in Mathura.\n58. Four kinds of men worship Me.\n59. Following the devotional process prescribed for the age, intelligent devotees in this world worship\nLord Gopala, who is accompanied by His elder brother Balarama and queen Rukmini.\n60. I am unborn, eternal Gopala. I am eternal Pradyumna. I am Rama. I am Aniruddha. He who is\nintelligent worships Me.\n61. Free from all impure desires, the residents of Krishnavana and Bhadravana worship Me, following\nthe regulations of bhakti I Myself have spoken.\n62. Even they who formerly rejected the principles of religion and were swallowed up by the age of\nKali, may become devoted to Me, and also reside in Mathura.\n63. Anyone who becomes My sincere devotee becomes very dear to Me. As dear as You and Your sons\nare, as dear as Shiva and hid associates, as dear as the goddess of fortune, Laksmi.\n64. Brahma said: How has the one Supreme Personality of Godhead become four Deities? How has the\nsingle sacred syllable om become many?\n65. The Lord said to him: Before the material world was manifest, only the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, who is one without a second, existed. From Him came the impersonal Brahman. From that\ncame the syllable om. From om came the mahat-tattva. From the mahat-tattva came false-ego. From\nfalse-ego came the five tanmatras. From them came the elements. Om is covered by these things.\n66. I am the sacred syllable. I am om. I am ageless, deathless, nectarean, the fearless Supreme Great. I\nam liberated. I am unchanging.\n67. The eternal Supreme Personality of Godhead manifested Himself as the all-pervading universal\nform. In the same way the Lord, who is one without a second, by His transcendental potency expanded\nHimself into four.\n68. The sacred syllable om consists of three letters: a, u and m. Balarama, the son of Rohini, is the\nletter a. Splendid Pradyumna is the letter u.\n69. Intelligent Aniruddha is letter m. Lord Krishna, in whom the entire universe rests, is the ardhamatra letter (m), which completes the syllable om.\n70. Rukmini is Lord Krishna\u2019s wife. She is the creator of the worlds and the root of material nature.\n71. The Vedic literatures explain that the goddess of fortune appeared among the women of Vraja.\nLearned transcendentalists say that the Lord\u2019s potency is the syllable om.\n72. Therefore, all-pervading Lord Gopala is the syllable om.\n\n73. Learned transcendentalists declare that the syllable om is not different from the sacred syllable\nklim.\n74. He whom meditates on Me as I appear in Mathura attains liberation.\n75-78. In his mind one should meditate on Me standing on the blossomed eight-petaled lotus of the\nheart, My two feet marked with conchshell, flag and umbrella, MY chest marked with srivatsa and\nsplendid with the kautabha gem, My four arms holding the conch, cakra, mace, and sarnga bow, My\narms decorated with armlets. MY neck splendid with a flower garland, My head circled by a splendid\ncrown, My ears decorated with glistening shark-shaped earrings, MY form splendid and handsome,\nholding a flute and buffalo-horn bugle, and granting fearlessness to the devotees.\n79. When the entire universe is churned (mathyate) by the churning-rod of spiritual knowledge, the\nbutter produced is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Mathura. That is why it is called Mathura.\n80. In my heart I meditate on the material world with its eight dik-palas (protectors of the directions) as\na blossomed lotus flower growing in the ocean of repeated birth and death.\n81. The sun and moon are the splendour of My body. Golden Mount Meru is My splendid flag.\nBrahmaloka as My umbrella. The seven lower planetary systems are My feet.\n82. I am marked with srivatsa and svarupa. Therefore the learned sages call me Srivatsa-lanchana\n(marked with srivatsa).\n83. Aware of My supremacy, the sages declare that the splendour of the sun, moon, fire, and eloquent\nspeech has come from My glittering Kaustubha jewel.\n84. The four arms of My universal form are goodness, passion, ignorance, and false-ego. The five\nmaterial elements are the conchshell I carry in the hand that is the mode of passion.\n85. Childishness is said to be the cakra, the original illusory potency the Sarnga bow, and the universe\nthe lotus flower in the hand of the universal form.\n86. The origin of ignorance is known as the club I always carry in My hand.\n87. Religion, economic development, and sense-gratification are the splendid bracelets that eternally\ndecorate the wrists of My universal form.\n88. The neck, said to be the qualityless Brahman, is garlanded by the first unborn. O Brahma, your\nmind-born sons have elaborately described this garland.\n89. The sages say that My eternal form is the crown.\n90. The two things above the changing material world are My two glittering earrings.\n91.He who meditates in this way is eternally dear to me. He attains liberation. He becomes liberated. I\ngive Myself to him.\n92. O Brahma, I have said all that will be about My two forms: one made of the modes of nature, and\nthe other beyond the modes of nature.\n93. Brahma said: What are the ornaments worn by the Deities You have described? How do the Maruts,\nRudras, Brahma, sons of Brahma, Vinayakas, twelve Adityas, Vasus, Apsaras, and Gandharvas worship\nthem? Who is the Deity that has gone to His own abode? Who is the Deity now invisible? Who is the\nDeity the humans worship?\n94. Lord Narayana said to him: these twelve unmanifested transcendental Deities are present on all\nplanets, among all demigods and all human beings.\n95. As a Rudra among the Rudras, as a Brahma among the followers of Brahma, as a demigod among\nthe demigods, as a human being among the humans, as the destroyer of obstacles (Ganesa) among the\nVinayakas, as Surya Narayana among the Adityas, as a Gandharva among the Gandharvas, as an\nApsara among the Apsaras, and as a Vasu among the Vasus, My form, which fulfils desires, is present\neven when it is invisible. Whether visible or invisible in this world, My form is always stays in My\nown abode.\n96. My form is also present as the Deity of ignorance, the Deity of passion, and the Deity of Goodness.\n97. My humanlike form, which is eternal and full of transcendental knowledge, is present in devotional\nservice.\n\n98. Om. Obeisances to the Supersoul, who is present in the life-breath. Om tat sat. Bhu Bhuvah and\nSvah. Obeisances, obeisances to Him, the Supersoul, who is present in the life-breath.\n99. Obeisances to Sri Krishna, who is Govinda and Gopijanavallabha, Om tat sat. Bhur Bhuvah and\nSvah. Obeisances, obeisances to Him.\n100. Om. Obeisances to the Supersoul, who is present in the apana air. Om tat sat. Bhur Bhuvah and\nSvah. Obeisances, obeisances to Him, present in the apana air.\n101. Om. Obeisances to Krishna, who is Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. Om tat\nsat. Bhur Bhuvah and Svah. Obeisances, obeisances to Him.\n102. Om. Obeisances to the Supersoul, who is present in the sama air. Om tat sat. Bhur Bhuvah and\nSvah. Obeisances, obeisances to Him, present in the same air.\n103. Om. Obeisances to Sri Krishna, who is Sri Rama. Om tat sat. Bhur Bhuvah and Svah. Obeisances,\nobeisances to Him.\n104. Om. Obeisances to the Supersoul, who is present in the udana air. Om tat sat.

Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nWhen the sages living in the forest visited Sri Ramachandra who was the incarnation of the ever joyful\nGod and who was extremely pretty, they became surprised and forgetting themselves said, \u201cWe want to\nembrace you, Oh Lord.\u201d The God told them, \u201cWhen I reincarnate as Lord Krishna, you will be born as\nGopis and then you can embrace me.\u201d[Their wish was fulfilled in Krishnavatara.] 1\nDuring the time of incarnation of the Lord as Krishna, Gokula became the forest heaven. Those who\nhad done penance earlier became trees in that forest. Characters like miserliness and anger became\nAsuras. The Kali period which was coming was postponed till the reincarnation period was over. That\nHari who was very pretty reincarnated himself as a Gopa Boy. His playful nature (play with the world)\nwas an unknowable secret. Because of that the world was enchanted. Upanishads and portions of Vedas\ncame in the form of 16108 maidens. The \"mercy\" was born as mother Rohini and the \u201cearth mother\u201d\nwas born as Sathya Bhama. \u201cHumility\u201d was born as Krishna\u2019s friend Sudhama. \u201cControl of senses\u201d\nwas born as Sage Udhawa and \u201cTruth\u201d was born as Sage Akroora. The broken curd pots became to\nKrishna the ocean of milk so that he can play with it. This reincarnation was meant to destroy his\nenemies and to protect good people. The sword in the hand of Krishna was the God of destruction, the\n\nMaheswara himself. Sage Kasyapa was born as the mortar in Yasodha\u2019s house and The God mother\nAdithi became the rope which tied Krishna to the mortar. Kali who destroys all enemies was the mace.\nThe bow called Saranga was the illusion of the God. The harvest season of Sarad became the meals in\nhis house. The lotus he held playfully was the seed for the world. Though the world was not different\nfrom all these, it appeared as if it was different. Similarly God himself did not have any differences.\nAnd the Vaikunta of those people who live in heaven was brought down to the world. The people who\nhave understood this truly would get the result of their good deeds. They would get themselves released\nfrom the ties of the body and attain salvation.\nOm !

    "Yajnavalkya": "\nYajnavalkya Upanishad\nTranslated by Prof. A. A. Ramanathan\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. Now King Janaka of the Videhas respectfully approached the sage Yajnavalkya and said: \u2018Revered\nSir, expound to me renunciation\u2019. Yajnavalkya said: Having completed the stage of a celibate student\none may become a house-holder. From the stage of the house-holder he may become a forest-dweller\n(Vanaprastha) and then renounce. Or else he may become a mendicant monk from the stage of a\ncelibate student or a house-holder or a forest-dweller. (There is also the provision that) a person may\nrenounce worldly life that very day on which distaste for it dawns on him, whether he is not observing\nvows (before the stage of renunciation) or observes them, whether he has undergone the prescribed\nablution on completing the disciplined studentship or not, whether he is one who has discontinued\nmaintaining ritual fire at the death of his wife (Utsannagni) or one who does not maintain the ritual fire\n(anagnika).\n2. Some (law givers) prescribe the sacrifice called Prajapatya (of which god Brahma is the presiding\ndeity, prior to a twice-born embracing renunciation). But (though thus prescribed) he may not do so. He\nshall only perform the sacrifice Agneyi (whose presiding deity is Agni, the god of fire). For Agni is the\nvital breath (Prana). Thereby he helps (strengthens) the vital breath. (Then) he shall perform the\nTraidhataviya sacrifice (whose presiding deity is the god Indra). By this sacrifice the three vital fluids\n(become strong like fire), namely the Sattva (semen), Rajas (blood) and Tamas (the dark one).\n(Having performed the sacrifice in the prescribed manner he shall smell the holy fire, reciting the\nfollowing mantra): \u2018Oh Fire, this (vital breath) is your source; as you are born at the proper time (of the\nyear) you put on effulgence. Knowing him (the Atman, your ultimate source) may you merge (with the\n\nPrana, your source). May you increase our wealth (of transcendent knowledge)\u2019. So reciting the mantra\nhe shall smell the fire. This is the source of fire, this vital air. \u2018(May you) go unto fire (your source).\nSvaha\u2019. Thus alone the mantra says.\n3. Having procured the holy fire (from the house of a well-versed Vedic scholar) in the village he shall\nbe directed to smell the fire as described previously. If he does not get the ritual fire he may offer\noblations in the waters. For water is (presided over by) all the gods. Reciting \u2018I offer the oblation to all\nthe gods, Svaha\u2019, he should tender the oblations and picking up (a small portion of) the offered oblation\nwhich is mixed with ghee, he shall eat it, as this is beneficial. (Before eating the offered oblation he\nshall recite) the mantra of liberation (namely Om) which he shall realize as (the essence of) the three\nVedas. He shall adore Brahman (Existence, Knowledge and Bliss) as that (connoted by Om). Cutting\noff the tuft of hair and sacred thread he shall recite thrice \u2018I have renounced\u2019. (The royal sage Janaka\naccepted this elucidation by saying) \u2018Indeed, so it is, revered Yajnavalkya\u2019.\n4. (Then prompted by King Janaka) the sage Atri asked Yajnavalkya: How is one without the sacred\nthread (by wearing which alone he can perform rituals) a Brahmana ? Yajnavalkya replied: This alone\nis his sacred thread (the conviction), \u2018That (Self-effulgent) Atman (I am)\u2019. He shall then ceremoniously\nsip water (thrice with the mantra, \u2018Reach the sea, Svaha\u2019, having previously discarded his tuft and\nsacred thread). This is the method (to be adopted by those who renounce the world).\n5. Then (in the case of those entitled to renunciation) the mendicant monk wearing (ochre) coloured\ngarment, with shaven head, accepting nothing (except food for bare sustenance), pure, injuring none (in\nthought, word and deed), (austerely) living on alms, becomes fit for realizing Brahman. This is the path\nof the mendicant monks. (In the case of the Kshatriyas and others not entitled to renunciation, they may\nseek liberation) by the path of the brave (by courting death in the battle-field), or fast (unto death as a\ndiscipline), or enter into water (to rise no more), or enter fire or undertake the great journey (in which\nthey collapse by exhaustion). (For those entitled to renunciation) this way has been prescribed by the\ngod Brahma; the ascetic who has renounced the world (Sannyasin) following this path realizes\nBrahman. Thus (it is stated in the Vedanta). \u2018Thus indeed it is, revered Sir, Yajnavalkya\u2019, (appreciated\nthe royal sage Janaka).\n6. There are the well known sages called Paramahamsas (as in the days of yore, the sages) Samvartaka,\nAruni, Svetaketu, Durvasas, Ribhu, Nidagha, Dattatreya, Suka, Vamadeva, Harita and others, wearing\nno distinguishing marks, with conduct beyond the ken (of worldly people) and who behaved as though\nbereft of their senses though (perfectly) sane.\n7. Averse to others\u2019 wives and (desire to stay in) towns and discarding all these, namely, the threefold\nstaff (bamboo), the water vessel, (the earthen plate) used for a meal, the ceremonial purification with\nwater, the tuft and the sacred thread, internally as well as externally, in the waters reciting \u2018Bhuh,\nSvaha\u2019, (the Paramahamsa) shall seek the Atman.\n8. Possessing a form as one new-born (i.e. unclad) unaffected by pairs (of opposites, such as heat and\ncold, pleasure and pain); accepting nothing (except alms, for bare sustenance); well established in the\npath of the truth of Brahman; of pure mind; receiving alms into the mouth (lit. into the vessel of the\nbelly) at the prescribed time in order to sustain life, becoming equanimous at gain and loss (of alms),\ndrinking water from the vessel of hand or from a water vessel, begging alms but to store in the belly;\ndevoid of any other vessel; the watering place serving as water vessel; sheltering, equanimous at gain\nand loss of it, in an abode which is free from disturbance and is solitary (such as) an unoccupied house,\na temple, a clump of (tall) grass (or hay stack), an ant-hill, the shade of a tree a potter\u2019s hut, a hut where\nritual fire is kept, the sandy bank of a river, a mountain thicket, a cave, a hollow in a tree, the vicinity of\na water fall or a piece of clean ground, without residing in a fixed abode; making no efforts (for gainful\nactivity) and deeply intent on the uprooting of good and bad actions \u2013 such a sage who finally gives up\nhis body in the state of renunciation is indeed a Paramahamsa. Thus (it has been declared).\n9. The mendicant monk who is unclad (lit. clothed by the points of the compass), salutes none, has no\ndesire for wife or son and is above aim and non-aim becomes the supreme God. Here there are the\n\nverses:\n10. To one who has become an ascetic earlier and who is equal to him in characteristics, obeisance\nought to be paid (by an ascetic) and never to any one else.\n11. Even ascetics are seen who are careless, whose minds are in outward phenomenal things, are talebearers, eager to quarrel and whose views are condemned by the Veda.\n12. If an ascetic remains in identity with the highest self-effulgent Brahman which is beyond name,\netc., then to whom shall he, the knower of the Atman, pay obeisance ? Then the activity (of bowing)\nought not to be done.\n13. (If an ascetic is convinced that) the supreme God has entered into beings as the individual Self, then\nhe may fully prostrate on the ground before dog, outcaste, cow or donkey.\n14. What possibly is charming in a woman who is a doll made of flesh, in a cage of limbs which is\nmoved by machinery and who is a conglomerate of tendons bones and joints ?\n15. Are the eyes (of a woman) charming when we look at them after dissection into skin, flesh, blood\nand tears ? Why then do you get infatuated in vain ?\n16. Similarly, Oh sage, is seen of the pearl necklace which shines bright (adoring women) in the onrush\nof the Ganga water down the shining slopes of the Meru mountain.\n17. In cemeteries (situated) in remote places the same breast of a woman is eaten in due course by dogs\nas if it were a small morsel of food.\n18. Having (attractive) tresses and putting on collyrium, women, difficult to touch but pleasing to the\neyes are (verily) the flames of the fire of sin and they burn men as though they were straw.\n19. Women pleasing and cruel, are the fuel for the hell-fires, that inflame even at a distance and though\njuicy (loveable) are devoid of moisture (flavour).\n20. Silly women are the nets spread by the hunter called Cupid to entangle the bodies of men in the\nform of birds.\n21. Woman is the bait stuck in the fish-hook at the string of evil propensity to catch men in the form of\nfish that are in the pond of worldly life and that are active in the mud of the mind.\n22. Enough of women to me, forever, who are the strong caskets (to preserve) all gems of evil and are\nthe chains of misery.\n23. He who has a woman with him has desire for enjoyment; where is the scope for enjoyment to one\nwho is without woman ? Discarding woman is discarding worldly life; one shall be happy after\nabandoning worldly life.\n24. A son unborn worries the (would be) parents for long; when obtained (in the womb) he gives\ntrouble due to miscarriage or the pangs of child-birth.\n25. When the boy is born there is the worry of evil planes, illness, etc., and then his propensity to evil\nways. When invested with the sacred thread he does not become learned and if he becomes wise he\nrefuses marriage.\n26. In youth he takes to adultery, etc., and has (the curse of) poverty when he has a family. There is no\nend of worry due to a son and if he is rich he (suddenly) may die.\n27. The (good) ascetic has no fickleness of hands and feet; he is not unsteady in his eyes and he is not\nloose with his speech; conquering his senses he becomes one with Brahman.\n28. When a person of discrimination sees equality and oneness between an enemy, a prisoner and his\nown body, where is (the scope for) anger, as towards the limbs of one\u2019s own body ?\n29. If you have any anger against a wrong doer, how is it you do not have anger against anger, as it\nforcibly blocks (the path to) duty, wealth, love and liberation ?\n30. My salutation to the anger against anger, which well sets ablaze its substratum and which gives one\ndispassion and awakens one to one\u2019s faults.\n31. Where the people are always asleep the man of self-control is wide awake; where they are vigilant,\nOh wise one, the prince among the Yogins, is in deep sleep. Be convinced that there is consciousness\nhere, that (all) this is consciousness alone and is pervaded by consciousness, that you are consciousness\n\nand I am consciousness, and all these worlds are of consciousness.\n32. Ascetics should accept this, the highest position of being a Paramahamsa. Oh best of sages, there is\nnothing higher than this. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Yajnavalkyopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Varaha": "\nVaraha Upanishad\nTranslated by K. Narayanasvami Aiyar\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nCHAPTER - I\nThe great sage Ribhu performed penance for twelve Deva (divine) years. At the end of the time, the\nLord appeared before him in the form of a boar. He said: \u201cRise, rise and choose your boon\u201d. The sage\ngot up and having prostrated himself before him said: \u201cO Lord, I will not, in my dream, wish of thee\nthose things that are desired by the worldly. All the Vedas, Shastras, Itihasas and all the hosts of other\nsciences, as well as Brahma and all the other Devas, speak of emancipation as resulting from a\nknowledge of thy nature. So impart to me that science of Brahman which treats of thy nature.\u201d\nThen the boar-shaped Bhagavan (Lord) said:\n1. Some disputants hold that there are twenty-four Tattvas (principles) and some thirty-six, whilst\nothers maintain that there are ninety-six.\n2. I shall relate them in their order. Listen with an attentive mind. The organs of sense are five, viz., ear,\nskin, eye and others.\n3. The organs of action are five, viz., mouth, hand, leg and others. Pranas (vital airs) are five; sound and\nother (viz., rudimentary principles) are five.\n4. Manas, Buddhi, Chitta and Ahankara are four; thus those that know Brahman know these to be the\ntwenty-four Tattvas.\n5. Besides these, the wise hold the quintuplicated elements to be five, viz., earth, water, fire, Vayu and\nAkasa;\n6. The bodies to be three, viz., the gross, the subtle and the Karana or causal; the states of\nconsciousness to be three, viz., the waking, the dreaming and the dreamless sleeping.\n7-8. The Munis know the total collection of Tattvas to be thirty-six (coupled with Jiva). With these\nTattvas, there are six changes, viz., existence, birth, growth, transformation, decay and destruction.\n\n9. Hunger, thirst, grief, delusion, old age and death are said to be the six infirmities.\n10. Skin, blood, flesh, fat, marrow and bones are said to be the six sheaths. Passion, anger, avarice,\ndelusion, pride and malice are the six kinds of foes.\n11. Vishva, Taijasa and Prajna are the three aspects of the Jiva. Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are the three\nGunas (qualities).\n12. Prarabdha, Sanchita and Agamin are the three Karmas. Talking, lifting, walking, excreting and\nenjoying are the five actions (of the organs of action);\n13. And there are also thought, certainty, egoism, compassion, memory (functions of Manas, etc.,),\ncomplacency, sympathy and indifference;\n14. Dik (the quarters), Vayu, Sun, Varuna, Ashvini Devas, Agni, Indra, Upendra and Mrityu (death);\nand then the moon, the four-faced Brahma, Rudra, Kshetrajna and Ishvara.\n15-16. Thus these are the ninety-six Tattvas. Those that worship, with devotion, me of the form of boar,\nwho am other than the aggregate of these Tattvas and am without decay are released from Ajnana and\nits effects and become Jivanmuktas.\n17. Those that know these ninety-six Tattvas will attain salvation in whatever order of life they may be,\nwhether they have matted hair or are of shaven head or have (only) their tuft of hair on. There is no\ndoubt of this.\u201d\nThus ends the first Chapter of Varaha Upanishad.\nCHAPTER - II\n1. The great Ribhu (again) addressed the Lord of Lakshmi of the form of boar thus: \u201cO Lord, please\ninitiate me into the supreme Brahma-Vidya (or science).\u201d\n2-3. Then the Lord who removes the miseries of his devotees being thus questioned, answered thus:\n\u201cThrough (the right observance of) the duties of one\u2019s own caste and orders of life, through religious\nausterities and through the pleasing of the Guru (by serving him rightly), arise to persons the four,\nVairagya, etc. They are the discrimination of the eternal from the non-eternal; indifference to the\nenjoyments of this and the other worlds;\n4-5(a). The acquisition of the six virtues, Sama, etc., and the longing after liberation. These should be\npractised. Having subdued the sensual organs and having given up the conception of \u2018mine\u2019 in all\nobjects, you should place your consciousness of \u2018I\u2019 in (or identify yourself with) me, who am the\nwitness Chaitanya (consciousness).\n5(b)-7(a). To be born as a human being is difficult \u2013 more difficult it is to be born as a male being \u2013 and\nmore so is it to be born as a Brahmana. Even then, if the fool does not cognise through the hearing, etc.,\nof Vedanta, the true nature of the Sachchidananda (of Brahman) that is all-pervading and that is beyond\nall caste and orders of life, when will he obtain Moksha?\n7(b)-8. I alone am happiness. There is none other. If there is said to be another, then it is not happiness.\nThere is no such things as love, except on my account. The love that is on account of me is not natural\nto me. As I am the seat of supreme love, that \u2018I am not\u2019 is not.\n9. He who is sought after by all, saying \u201cI should become such\u201d, is myself, the all-pervading. How can\nnon-light affect Atman, the self-shining which is no other than the light whence originates the words \u2018I\nam not light\u2019.\n10-12(a). My firm conviction is whoever knows for certain that (Atman) which is self-shining and has\nitself no basis (to rest upon), is one of Vijnana. The universe, Jiva, Ishvara, Maya and others do not\nreally exist, except my full Atman.\n12(b)-13(a). I have not their characteristics, Karma which has Dharana and other attributes and is of the\nform of darkness and Ajnana is not fit to touch (or affect) me, who am Atman, the self-resplendent.\n13(b)-14(a). That man who sees (his) Atman which is all-witness and is beyond all caste and orders of\nlife as of the nature of Brahman, becomes himself Brahman.\n14(b)-15(a). Whoever sees, through the evidence of Vedanta, this visible universe as the Supreme Seat\n\nwhich is of the form of light, attains Moksha at once.\n15(b)-16(a). When that knowledge which dispels the idea that this body (alone) is Atman, arises firmly\nin one\u2019s mind as was before the knowledge that this body (alone) is Atman, then that person, even\nthough he does not desire Moksha, gets it.\n16(b)-17(a). Therefore how will a person be bound by Karma, who always enjoys the bliss of Brahman\nwhich has the characteristics of Sachchidananda and which is other than Ajnana ?\n17(b)-18. Persons with spiritual eyes see Brahman, that is the witness of the three states that has the\ncharacteristics of be-ness, wisdom and bliss, that is the underlying meaning of the words \u2018Thou\u2019\n(Tvam) and \u2018I\u2019 (Aham) and that is untouched by all the stains.\n19. As a blind man does not see the sun that is shining, so an ignorant person does not see (Brahman).\nPrajnana alone is Brahman. It has truth and Prajnana as its characteristics.\n20. By thus cognising Brahman well, a person becomes immortal. One who knows his own Atman as\nBrahman, that is bliss and without duality and Gunas (qualities) and that is truth and absolute\nconsciousness is not afraid of anything.\n21. That which is consciousness alone which is all-pervading, which is eternal, which is all-full, which\nis of the form of bliss and which is indestructible, is the only true Brahman.\n22-23(a). It is the settled determination of Brahma-Jnanis that there is naught else but that. As the world\nappears dark to the blind and bright to those having good eyes, so this world full of manifold miseries\nto the ignorant is full of happiness to the wise.\n23(b)-24(a). In me, of the form of boar, who am infinite and the Bliss of absolute Consciousness, if\nthere is the conception of non-dualism, where then is bondage ? And who is the one to be\nemancipated ?\n24(b)-25(a). The real nature of all embodied objects is ever the absolute Consciousness. Like the pot\nseen by the eyes, the body and its aggregates are not (viz., do not really exist).\n25(b)-26. Knowing, as Atman, all the locomotive and fixed worlds that appear as other than Atman,\nmeditate upon them as \u2018It I am\u2019. Such a person then enjoys his real nature. There is no other to be\nenjoyed than one-Self.\n27. If there is anything that is, then Brahman alone has that attribute. One who is perfect in BrahmaJnana, though he always sees this established universe, does not see it other than his Atman.\n28-30. By cognising clearly my form, one is not trammelled by Karma. He is an undaunted person who\nby his own experience cognises as his own real nature all (the universe and Brahman) that is without\nthe body and the organs of sense \u2013 that is the all-witness \u2013 that is the one noumenal Vijnana, that is the\nblissful Atman (as contrasted with Jivatma or the lower self) and that is the self-resplendent. He is one\nthat should be known as \u2018I\u2019 (myself). O Ribhu, may you become He.\n31. After this, there will be never any experience of the world. Thereafter there will always be the\nexperience of the wisdom of one\u2019s own true nature. One who has this known fully Atman has neither\nemancipation nor bondage.\n32. Whoever meditates, even for one Muhurta (48 minutes) through the cognition of one\u2019s own real\nform, upon Him who is dancing as the all-witness, is released from all bondage.\n33. Prostrations \u2013 prostrations to me who am in all the elements, who am the Chidatma (viz., Atman of\nthe nature of wisdom) that is eternal and free and who am the Pratyagatman.\n34-35. O Devata, you are I. I am you. Prostrations on account of myself and yourself who are infinite\nand who are Chidatma, myself being the supreme Isha (Lord) and yourself being Shiva (of a beneficent\nnature). What should I do ? Where should I go ? What should I reject ?\n36. (Nothing, because) the universe is filled by me as with the waters on the universal deluge. Whoever\ngives up (fondness) love of the external, love of the internal and love of the body and thus gives up all\nassociations, is merged in me. There is no doubt about it.\n37. That Paramahamsa (ascetic) who, though living in the world, keeps aloof from human congregation\nas from serpent, who regards a beautiful woman as a (living) corpse and the endless sensual objects as\n\npoison and who has abandoned all passion and is indifferent towards all objects is no other than\nVasudeva, (viz.,) myself.\n38. This is Satya (Truth). This is nothing but truth. It is truth alone that is now said. I am Brahman, the\ntruth. There is naught else but I.\n39. (The word) \u2018Upavasa\u2019 (lit., dwelling near) signifies the dwelling near (or union) of Jivatma and\nParamatman and not (the religious observance as accepted by the worldly of) emaciating the body\nthrough fasts.\n40. To the ignorant, what is the use of the mere drying up of the body ? By beating about the hole of a\nsnake, can we be said to have killed the big snake within.\n41. A man is said to attain Paroksha (indirect) wisdom when he knows (theoretically) that there is\nBrahman; but he is said to attain Sakshatkara (direct cognition) when he knows (or realises) that he is\nhimself Brahman.\n42. When a Yogin knows his Atman to be the Absolute, then he becomes a Jivanmukta.\n43. To Mahatmas, to be always in the state \u2018I am Brahman\u2019 conduces to their salvation. There are two\nwords for bondage and Moksha. They are \u2018mine\u2019 and \u2018not mine\u2019.\n44. Man is bound by \u2018mine\u2019, but he is released by \u2018not mine\u2019. He should abandon all the thoughts\nrelating to externals and so also with references to internals. O Ribhu, having given up all thoughts, you\nshould rest content (in your Atman) ever.\u201d\n45. The whole of the universe is caused through Sankalpa alone. It is only through Sankalpa that the\nuniverse manifests. Having abandoned the universe, which is of the form of Sankalpa and having fixed\nyour mind upon the Nirvikalpa (one which is changeless), meditate upon my abode in your heart.\n46. O most intelligent being, pass your time in meditating upon me, glorifying me in songs, talking\nabout me to one another and thus devoting yourself entirely to me as the Supreme.\n47. Whatever is Chit (consciousness) in the universe is only Chinmatra. This universe is Chinmaya\nonly. You are Chit. I am Chit; contemplate upon the worlds also as Chit.\n48-49(a). Make the desires nil. Always be without any stain. How then can the bright lamp of Atmic\nVijnana arising through the Vedas be affected by the Karma arising from the ignorance of the actor and\nthe agent ?\n49(b)-50(a). Having given up not-Atman and being in the world unaffected by it, delight only in the\nChinmatra within, ever intent on the One.\n50(b)-51(a). As the Akasa of the pot and that of the house are both located in the all-pervading Akasa,\nso the Jivas and Ishvara are only evolved out of me, the Chidakasa (the one Akasa of universal\nconsciousness).\n51(b)-52(a). So that which did not exist before the evolution of Atmas (Jiva) (and Ishvara) and that\nwhich is rejected at the end (viz., universal deluge) is called Maya by Brahma-Jnanis through their\ndiscrimination.\n52(b)-53(a). Should Maya and its effects (the universe) be annihilated, there is no state of Ishvara, there\nis no state of Jiva. Therefore like the Akasa without its vehicle, I am the immaculate and Chit.\n53(b)-54. The creation, sentient as well as non-sentient from Ikshana (thinking) to Pravesha (entry) of\nthose having the forms of Jivas and Ishvara is due to the creation (or illusion) of Ishvara; while the\nSamsara (worldly existence) from the waking state to salvation is due to the creation of Jiva.\n55. So the Karmas ordained in the sacrifice (called) Trinachaka (so called after Nachiketas of Katha\nUpanishad) to Yoga are dependent upon the illusion of Ishvara; while (the systems from) Lokayata\n(atheistical system) to Sankhya rest on the illusion of Jiva.\n56. Therefore aspirants after salvation should never make their heads enter into the field of controversy\nregarding Jiva and Ishvara. But with an undisturbed mind, Tattvas of Brahman should be investigated.\n57. Those who do not cognise the Tattva of the secondless Brahman are all deluded persons only.\nWhence (then) is salvation to them ? Whence then is happiness (to them) in this universe ?\n58. What if they have the thoughts of the superiority and inferiority (of Ishvara and Jiva) ? Will\n\nsovereignty and mendicancy (experienced by a person) in the dreaming state affect him in his waking\nstate ?\n59. When Buddhi is absorbed in Ajnana, then it is termed, by the wise, sleep. Whence then is sleep to\nme who have not Ajnana and its effects ?\n60. When Buddhi is in full bloom, then it is said to be the Jagrat (waking state). As I have no changes,\netc., there is no waking state to me.\n61. The moving about of Buddhi in the subtle Nadis constitutes the dreaming state. In me without the\nact of moving about, there is no dreaming.\n62. Then at the time of Sushupti when all things are absorbed, enveloped by Tamas, he then enjoys the\nhighest bliss of his own nature in an invisible state.\n63. If he sees everything as Chit without any difference, he alone is an actual Vijnani. He alone is\nShiva. He alone is Hari. He alone is Brahma.\n64. This mundane existence which is an ocean of sorrow, is nothing but a long-lived dream, or an\nillusion of the mind or a long-lived reign of the mind. From rising from sleep till going to bed, the one\nBrahman alone should be contemplated upon.\n65. By causing to be absorbed this universe which is but a superimposition, the Chitta partakes of my\nnature. Having annihilated all the six powerful enemies, through their destruction become the non-dual\nOne like the scent-elephant.\n66. Whether the body perishes now or lasts the age of moon and stars, what matters it to me having\nChit alone as my body ? What matters it to the Akasa in the pot, whether it (the pot) is destroyed now\nor exists for a long time.\n67. While the Slough of a serpent lies cast off lifeless in its hole, it (the serpent) does not evince any\naffection towards it.\n68. Likewise the wise do not identify themselves with their gross and subtle bodies. If the delusive\nknowledge (that the universe is real) with its cause should be destroyed by the fire of Atma-Jnana, the\nwise man becomes bodiless, through the idea \u2018It (Brahman) is not this; It is not this\u2019.\n69. Shastras, the knowledge of reality (of the universe) perishes. Through direct perception of truth,\none\u2019s fitness for action (in this universe) ceases. With the cessation of Prarabdha (the portion of the past\nKarma which is being enjoyed in this life), the destruction of the manifestation (of the universe) takes\nplace. Maya is thus destroyed in a three-fold manner.\n70. If within himself no identification (of Jiva) with Brahman takes place, the state (of the separateness)\nof Jiva does not perish. If the non-dual one is truly discerned, then all affinities (for objects) cease.\n71. With the cessation of Prarabdha (arising from the cessation of affinities), there is that of the body.\nTherefore it is certain that Maya perishes thus entirely. If it is said that all the universe is, that Brahman\nalone is that is of the nature of Sat.\n72. If it is said that the universe shines, then it is Brahman alone that shines. (The mirage of) all the\nwater in an oasis is really no other than the oasis itself. Through inquiry of one\u2019s Self, the three worlds\n(above, below and middle) are only of the nature of Chit.\n73. In Brahman, which is one and alone, the essence of whose nature is absolute consciousness and\nwhich is remote from the differences of Jiva, Ishvara and Guru, there is no Ajnana. Such being the case,\nwhere then is the occasion for the universe there ? I am that Brahman which is all full.\n74. While the full moon of wisdom is robbed of its lustre by the Rahu (one of the two nodes of the\nmoon) of delusion, all actions such as the rites of bathing, alms-giving and sacrifice performed during\nthe time of eclipse are all fruitless.\n75. As salt dissolved in water becomes one, so if Atman and Manas become identified, it is termed\nSamadhi.\n76. Without the grace of a good (perfect) guru, the abandonment of sensual objects is very difficult of\nattainment; so also the perception of (divine) truth and the attainment of one\u2019s true state.\n77. Then the state of being in one\u2019s own self shines of its own accord in a Yogin in whom Jnana-Sakti\n\nhas dawned and who has abandoned all Karmas.\n78. The (property of) fluctuation is natural to mercury and mind. If either mercury is bound (or\nconsolidated) or mind is bound (or controlled), what then on this earth cannot be accomplished ?\n79. He who obtains Murchchha cures all diseases. The dead are brought to life again. He who has\nbound (his mind or mercury) is able to move in the air. Therefore mercury and mind confer upon one\nthe state of Brahman.\n80. The master of Indriyas (the organs) is Manas (mind). The master of Manas is Prana. The master of\nPrana is Laya (absorption Yoga). Therefore Laya-Yoga should be practised.\n81. To the Yogins, Laya(-Yoga) is said to be without actions and changes. This Laya (absorption) of\nmind which is above speech and in which one has to abandon all Sankalpas and to give up completely\nall actions, should be known through one\u2019s own (experience).\n82. As an actress, though subject (or dancing in harmony) to music, cymbals and other musical\ninstruments of time, has her mind intent upon he protection of the pot on her head, so the Yogin, though\nintent for the time being upon the hosts of objects, never leaves off the mind contemplating on\nBrahman.\n83. The person who desires all the wealth of Yoga should, after having given up all thoughts, practise\nwith a subdued mind concentration on Nada (spiritual sound) alone.\u201d\nThus ends the second Chapter of Varaha Upanishad.\nCHAPTER - III\n1. \u201cThe One Principle cannot at any time become of manifold forms. As I am the partless, there is none\nelse but myself.\n2. Whatever is seen and whatever is heard is no other than Brahman. I am that Para-Brahman, which is\nthe eternal, the immaculate, the free, the one, the undivided bliss, the non-dual, the truth, the wisdom\nand the endless.\n3. I am of the nature of bliss; I am of undivided wisdom; I am the supreme of the supreme; I am the\nresplendent absolute Consciousness. As the clouds do not touch the Akasa, so the miseries attendant on\nmundane existence do not affect me.\n4. Know all to be happiness through the annihilation of sorrow and all to be of the nature of Sat (beness) through the annihilation of Asat (not-be-ness). It is only the nature of Chit (Consciousness) that is\nassociated with this visible universe. Therefore my form is partless.\n5. To an exalted Yogin, there is neither birth nor death, nor going (to other spheres), nor returning (to\nearth); there is no stain or purity or knowledge but (the universe) shines to him as absolute\nConsciousness.\n6. Practise always silence \u2018I am (viz., that you yourself are) Para-Brahman\u2019 which is truth and absolute\nConsciousness, which is undivided and non-dual, which is invisible, which is stainless, which is pure,\nwhich is second-less and which is beneficent.\n7. It (Brahman) is not subject to birth and death, happiness and misery. It is not subject to caste, law,\nfamily and Gotra (clan). Practise silence \u2013 I am Chit, which is the Vivarta-Upadana (viz., the illusory\ncause) of the universe.\n8. Always practise silence \u2013 I am (viz., you are) the Brahman, that is the full, the secondless, the\nundivided consciousness which has neither the relationship nor the differences existing in the universe\nand which partakes of the essence of the non-dual and the supreme Sat and Chit.\n9. That which always is and that which preserves the same nature during the three periods of time,\nunaffected by anything, is my eternal form of Sat.\n10. Even the state of happiness which is eternal without Upadhis (vehicles) and which is superior to all\nthe happiness derivable from Sushupti is of my bliss only.\n11. As by the rays of the sun, thick gloom is soon destroyed, so darkness, the cause of rebirth is\ndestroyed by Hari (Vishnu) Viz., the sun\u2019s lustre.\n\n12. Through the contemplation and worship of my (Hari\u2019s) feet, every person is delivered from his\nignorance. The means of destroying deaths and births is only through the contemplation of my feet.\n13. As a lover of wealth praises a wealthy man, so if with earnestness a person praises the Cause of the\nuniverse, who will not be delivered from bondage ?\n14. As in the presence of the sun the world of its-own accord begins to perform its actions, so in my\npresence all the worlds are animated to action.\n15. As to the mother-of pearl, the illusory conception of silver is falsely attributed, so to me is falsely\nattributed through Maya this universe which is composed of Mahat, etc.\n16. I am not with those differences that are (observable) in the body of low caste men, the body of cow,\netc., the fixed one\u2019s, the bodies of Brahmanas and others.\n17. As to a person, even after being relieved from the misconception of the directions, the (same\nmisconception of) direction continues (as before), just so is to me the universe though destroyed by\nVijnana. Therefore the universe is not.\n18. I am neither the body nor the organs of sense and action, nor Pranas, Nor Manas, nor Buddhi, nor\nAhankara, nor Chitta, nor Maya, nor the universe including Akasa and others.\n19. Neither am I the actor, the enjoyer, nor he who causes the enjoyment. I am Brahman that is Chit,\nSat and Ananda alone and that is Janardana (Vishnu).\n20. As, through the fluctuation of water, the sun (reflected therein) is moved, so Atman arises in this\nmundane existence through its mere connection with Ahankara.\n21. This mundane existence has Chitta as its root. This (Chitta) should be cleansed by repeated effort.\nHow is it you have your confidence in the greatness of Chitta ?\n22. Alas, where is all the wealth of the kings ! Where are the Brahmanas ? Where are all the worlds ?\nAll old ones are gone. Many fresh evolutions have occurred.\n23. Many Crores of Brahmas have passed away. Many kings have flitted away like particles of dust.\nEven to a Jnani, the love of the body may arise through the Asura (demoniacal) nature. If the Asura\nnature should arise in a wise man, his knowledge of truth becomes fruitless.\n24. Should Rajas and others generated in us be burnt by the fire of discriminative (divine) wisdom, how\ncan they germinate again ?\n25. Just as a very intelligent person delights in the shortcomings of another, so if one finds out his own\nfaults (and corrects them) who will not be relieved from bondage ?\n26. O Lord of Munis, only he who has not Atma-Jnana and who is not an emancipated person, longs\nafter Siddhis. He attains such Siddhis through medicine, (or wealth), Mantras, religious works, time\nand skill.\n27. In the eyes of an Atma-Jnani, these Siddhis are of no importance. One who has become an AtmaJnani, one who has his sight solely on Atman, and one who is content with Atman (the higher Self)\nthrough (his) Atman (or the lower self), never follows (the dictates of) Avidya.\n28. Whatever exists in this world, he knows to be of the nature of Avidya. How then will an Atma-Jnani\nwho has relinquished Avidya be immersed in (or affected by) it.\n29. Though medicine, Mantras, religious work, time and skill (or mystical expressions) lead to the\ndevelopment of Siddhis, yet they cannot in any way help one to attain the seat of Paramatman.\n30. How then can one who is an Atma-Jnani and who is without his mind be said to long after Siddhis,\nwhile all the actions of his desires are controlled ?\u201d\nThus ends the third Chapter of Varaha Upanishad.\nCHAPTER - IV\nOn another occasion Nidagha asked Lord Ribhu to enlighten him as to the characteristics of\nJivanmukti. To which Ribhu replied in the affirmative and said the following: \u201cIn the seven Bhumikas\n(or stages of development of wisdom) there are four kinds of Jivanmuktas. Of these the first stage is\nSubhechcha (good desire); the second is Vicharana (inquiry); the third is Tanumanasi (or pertaining to\n\nthe thinned mind); the fourth is Sattvapatti (the attainment of Sattva); the fifth is Asamsakti (nonattachment); the sixth is the Padartha-Bhavana (analysis of objects) and the seventh is the Turya (fourth\nor final stage). The Bhumika which is of the form of Pranava (Om) is formed of (or is divided into)\nAkara \u2013 \u2018A\u2019, Ukara \u2013 \u2018U\u2019, Makara - \u2018M\u2019 and Ardha-Matra. Akara and others are of four kinds on\naccount of the difference of Sthula (gross) Sukshma (subtle), Bija (seed or causal) and Sakshi\n(witness). Their Avasthas are four: waking, dreaming, dreamless sleeping and Turya (fourth). He who is\nin (or the entity that identifies itself with) the waking state in the gross Amsa (essence or part) of Akara\nis named Vishva; in the subtle essence, he is termed Taijasa; in the Bija essence, he is termed Prajna;\nand in the Sakshi essence, he is termed Turya.\nHe who is in the dreaming state (or the entity which identifies itself with the dreaming state) in the\ngross essence of Ukara is Vishva; in the subtle essence, he is termed Taijasa; in the Bija essence, is\ntermed Prajna; and in the Sakshi essence, he is termed Turya.\nHe who is in the Sushupti state in the gross essence of Makara is termed Vishva; in the subtle essence,\nTaijasa; in the Bija essence, he is termed Prajna; and in the Sakshi essence, he is termed Turya.\nHe who is in Turya State in the gross essence of Ardha-Matra is termed Turya-Vishva. In the subtle, he\nis termed Taijasa; in the Bija essence, he is termed Prajna; and in the Sakshi essence, he is termed\nTurya-Turya.\nThe Turya essence of Akara is (or embraces) the first, second and third (Bhumikas or stages of the\nseven). The Turya essence of Ukara embraces the fourth Bhumika. The Turya essence of Makara\nembraces the fifth Bhumika. The Turya essence of Ardha-Matra is the sixth stage. Beyond this, is the\nseventh stage.\nOne who functions in the (first) three Bhumikas is called Mumukshu; one who functions in the fourth\nBhumika is called a Brahmavit; one who functions in the fifth Bhumika is called a Brahmavidvara; one\nwho functions in the sixth Bhumika is called a Brahmavidvariya; and one in the seventh Bhumika is\ncalled a Brahmavidvarishtha. With reference to this, there are Slokas. They are:\n1. Subhechcha is said to be the first Jnana-Bhumi (or stage of wisdom); Vicharana, the second;\nTanumanasi, the third;\n2. Sattvapatti, the fourth; then come Asamsakti as the fifth, Padartha-Bhavana as the sixth and Turya as\nthe seventh.\n3. The desire that arise in one through sheer Vairagya (after resolving) \u2018Shall I be ignorant ? I will be\nseen by the Shastras and the wise\u2019 (or \u2018I will study the books and be with the wise\u2019) \u2013 is termed by the\nwise as Subhechcha.\n4. The association with the wise and Shastras and the following of the right path preceding the practice\nof indifference is termed Vicharana.\n5. That stage wherein the hankering after sensual objects is thinned through the first and second stages\nis said to be Tanumanasi.\n6. That stage wherein having become indifferent to all sensual objects through the exercise in the\n(above) three stages, the purified Chitta rests on Atman which is of the nature of Sat is called\nSattvapatti.\n7. The light (or manifestation) of Sattva-Guna that is firmly rooted (in one) without any desire for the\nfruits of actions through the practice in the above four stages is termed Asamsakti.\n8-9. That stage wherein through the practice in the (above) five stages one, having found delight in\nAtman, has no conception of the internals or externals (though before him) and engages in actions only\nwhen impelled to do so by others is termed Padartha-Bhavana, the sixth stage.\n10. The stage wherein after exceedingly long practice in the (above) six stages one is (immovably)\nfixed in the contemplation of Atman alone without the difference (of the universe) is the seventh stage\ncalled Turya.\n11. The three stages beginning with Subhechcha are said to be attained with (or amidst) differences and\nnon-differences. (Because) the universe one sees in the waking state he thinks to be really existent.\n\n12. When the mind is firmly fixed on the non-dual One and the conception of duality is put down, then\nhe sees this universe as a dream through his union with the fourth stage.\n13. As the autumnal cloud being dispersed vanishes, so this universe perishes. O Nidagha, be\nconvinced that such a person has only Sattva remaining.\n14. Then having ascended the fifth stage called Sushuptipada (dreamless sleeping seat), he remains\nsimply in the non-dual state, being freed from all the various differences.\n15-16(a). Having always introvision though ever participating in external actions, those that are\nengaged in the practice of this (sixth stage) are seen like one sleeping when fatigued (viz., being freed\nfrom all affinities).\n16(b). (Lastly) the seventh stage which is the ancient and which is called Gudhasupti is generally\nattained.\n17. Then one remains in that secondless state without fear and with his consciousness almost\nannihilated where there is neither Sat nor Asat, neither self nor not-self.\n18. Like an empty pot in the Akasa, there is void both within and without; like a filled vessel in the\nmidst of an ocean, he is full both within and without.\n19. Do not become either the knower or the known. May you become the Reality which remains after\nall thoughts are given up.\n20. Having discarded (all the distinctions of) the seer, the sight and the seen with their affinities,\nmeditate solely upon Atman which shines as the supreme Light.\n21. He is said to be a Jivanmukta (emancipated person) in whom, though participating in the material\nconcerns of the world, the universe is not seen to exist like the invisible Akasa.\n22. He is said to be a Jivanmukta, the light of whose mind never sets or rises in misery or happiness\nand who does not seek to change what happens to him (viz., either to diminish his misery or increase\nhis happiness).\n23. He is said to be a Jivanmukta who though in his Sushupti is awake and to whom the waking state is\nunknown and whose wisdom is free from the affinities (of objects).\n24. He is said to be a Jivanmukta whose heart is pure like Akasa, though acting (as it) in consonance to\nlove, hatred, fear and others.\n25. He is said to be a Jivanmukta who has not the conception of his being the actor and whose Buddhi\nis not attached to material objects, whether he performs actions or not.\n26. He is said to be a Jivanmukta, of whom people are not afraid, who is not afraid of people and who\nhas given up joy, anger and fear.\n27. He is said to be a Jivanmukta, who though participating in all the illusory objects, is cool amidst\nthem and is a full Atman, (being) as if they belonged to others.\n28. O Muni, he is said to be a Jivanmukta, who having eradicated all the desires of his Chitta, is (fully)\ncontent with me who am the Atman of all.\n29. He is said to be a Jivanmukta, who rests with an unshaken mind in that all pure abode which is\nChinmatra and free from all the modifications of Chitta.\n30. He is said to be a Jivanmukta in whose Chitta do not dawn (the distinctions of) the universe, I, he,\nthou and others that are visible and unreal.\n31. Through the path of the Guru and Shastras, enter soon sat \u2013 the Brahman that is immutable, great,\nfull and without objects \u2013 and be firmly seated there.\n32. Shiva alone is Guru; Shiva alone is Vedas; Shiva alone is Lord; Shiva alone is I; Shiva alone is all.\nThere is none other than Shiva.\n33. The undaunted Brahmana having known Him (Shiva) should attain wisdom. One need not utter\nmany words as they but injure the organ of speech.\n34. (The Rishi) Suka is a Mukta (emancipated person). (The Rishi) Vamadeva is a Mukta. There are no\nothers (who have attained emancipation) than through these (viz., the two paths of these two Rishis).\nThose brave men who follow the path of Suka in this world become Sadyo-Muktas (viz., emancipated)\n\nimmediately after (the body wear away);\n35. While those who always follow the path of Vamadeva (i.e., Vedanta) in this world are subject again\nand again to rebirths and attain Krama (gradual) emancipation, through Yoga, Sankhya and Karmas\nassociated with Sattva (Guna).\n36. Thus there are two paths laid down by the Lord of Devas (viz.,) the Suka and Vamadeva paths. The\nSuka path is called the bird\u2019s path; while the Vamadeva path is called the ant\u2019s path.\n37-38. Those persons that have cognised the true nature of their Atman through the\nmandatory and prohibitory injunctions (of the Vedas), the inquiry into (the true meaning of) MahaVakyas (the sacred sentences of the Vedas), the Samadhi of Sankhya Yoga or Asamprajnata Samadhi\nand that have thereby purified themselves, attain the supreme seat through the Suka path.\n39-40. Having, through Hatha-Yoga practice with the pain caused by Yama, postures, etc., become\nliable to the ever recurring obstacles caused by Anima and other (Siddhis) and having not obtained\ngood results, one is born again in a great family and practises Yoga through his previous (Karmic)\naffinities.\n41. Then through the practice of Yoga during many lives, he attains salvation (viz.,) the supreme seat of\nVishnu through the Vamadeva path.\n42. Thus there are two paths that lead to the attainment of Brahman and that are beneficent. The one\nconfers instantaneous salvation and the other confers gradual salvation. To one that sees (all) as the one\n(Brahman), where is delusion ? Where is sorrow ?\n43. Those that are under the eyes of those whose Buddhi is solely occupied with the truth (of Brahman)\nthat is the end of all experience are released from all heinous sins.\n44. All beings inhabiting heaven and earth that fall under the vision of Brahmavits are at once\nemancipated from the sins committed during many Crores of births.\u201d\nThus ends the fourth Chapter of Varaha Upanishad.\nCHAPTER - V\nThen Nidagha asked Lord Ribhu to enlighten him as to the rules (to be observed) in the practice of\nYoga. Accordingly He (the Lord) said thus:\n1. \u201cThe body is composed of the five elements. It is filled with five Mandalas (spheres). That which is\nhard is Prithvi (earth), one of them; that which is liquid is Apas;\n2. That which is bright is Tejas (fire); motion is the property of Vayu; that which pervades everywhere\nis Akasa. All these should be known by an aspirant after Yoga.\n3. Through the blowing of Vayu-Mandala in this body, (there are caused) 21,600 breaths every day and\nnight.\n4. If there is a diminution in the Prithvi-Mandala, there arise folds in the body; if there is diminution in\nthe essence of Apas, there arises gradually greyness of hair;\n5. If there is diminution in the essence of Tejas, there is loss of hunger and lustre; if there is diminution\nin the essence of Vayu, there is incessant tremor;\n6. If there is diminution in the essence of Akasa, one dies. The Jivita (viz., Prana) which possesses\nthese elements having no place to rest (in the body) owing to the diminution of the elements, rises up\nlike birds flying up in the air.\n7. It is for this reason that is called Udyana (lit., flying up). With reference to this, there is said to be a\nBandha (binding, also meaning a posture called Udyana-Bandha, by which this flight can be arrested).\nThis Udyana-Bandha is to (or does away with) death, as a lion to an elephant.\n8. Its experience is in the body, as also the Bandha. Its binding (in the body) is hurtful. If there is\nagitation of Agni (fire) within the belly, then there will be caused much of pain.\n9. Therefore this (Udyana-Bandha) should not be practised by one who is hungry or who has urgency\nto make water or void excrement. He should take many times in small quantities proper and moderate\nfood.\n\n10. He should practise Mantra-Yoga. Laya-Yoga and Hatha-Yoga, through mild, middling and\ntranscendental methods (or periods) respectively. Laya, Mantra and Hatha-Yogas have each (the same)\neight subservients.\n11-12(a). They are Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi.\n12(b)-13(a). (Of these), Yama is of ten kinds. They are non-injury, truth, non-coveting, continence,\ncompassion, straightforwardness, patience, courage, moderate eating and purity (bodily and mental).\n13(b)-14. Niyama is of ten kinds. They are Tapas (religious austerities), contentment, belief in the\nexistence of God or Vedas, charity, worship of Ishvara (or God), listening to the expositions of religious\ndoctrines, modesty, a (good) intellect, Japa (muttering of prayers) and Vrata (religious observances).\n15-16. They are eleven postures beginning with Chakra. Chakra, Padma, Kurma, Mayura, Kukkuta,\nVira, Svastika, Bhadra, Simha, Mukta and Gomukha are the postures enumerated by the knowers of\nYoga.\n17. Placing the left ankle on the right thigh and the right ankle on the left thigh and keeping the body\nerect (while sitting) is the posture \u201cChakra\u201d.\n18. Pranayama should be practised again and again in the following order, viz., inspiration, restraint of\nbreath and expiration. The Pranayama is done through the Nadis (nerves). Hence it is called the Nadis\nthemselves.\n19. The body of every sentient being is ninety-six digits long. In the middle of the body, two digits\nabove the anus and two digits below the sexual organ, is the centre of the body (called Muladhara or\nsacral plexus).\n20-21. Nine digits above the genitals, there is Kanda of Nadis which revolves oval-shaped, four digits\nhigh and four digits broad. It is surrounded by fat, flesh, bone and blood.\n22. In it, is situate a Nadi-Chakra (wheel of nerves) having twelve spokes. Kundali by which this body\nis supported is there.\n23. It is covering by its face the Brahmarandhra (viz., Brahma\u2019s hole) of Susumna. (By the side) of\nSusumna dwell the Nadis Alambusa and Kuhuh.\n24. In the next two (spokes) are Varuna and Yasasvini. On the spoke south of Susumna is, in regular\ncourse, Pingala.\n25. On the next two spokes, are Pusha and Payasvini. On the spoke west of Susumna is the Nadi called\nSarasvati.\n26. On the next two spokes are Sankhini and Gandhari. To the north of Susumna dwells Ida;\n27-28. In the next is Hastijihva; in the next is Visvodara. In these spokes of the wheel, the twelve Nadis\ncarry the twelve Vayus from left to right (to the different parts of the body). The Nadis are like (i.e.\nwoven like the warp and woof of) cloth. They are said to have different colours.\n29-30. The central portion of the cloth (here the collection of the Nadis) is called the Nabhi Chakra\n(navel plexus). Jvalanti, Nadarupini, Pararandhra and Susumna are called the (basic) supports of Nada\n(spiritual sound). These four Nadis are of ruby colour. The central portion of Brahmarandhra is again\nand again covered by Kundali.\n31-33(a). Thus ten Vayus move in these Nadis. A wise man who has understood the course of Nadis\nand Vayus should, after keeping his neck and body erect with his mouth closed, contemplate\nimmovably upon Turyaka (Atman) at the tip of his nose, in the centre of his heart and in the middle of\nBindu and should see with a tranquil mind through the (mental) eyes, the nectar flowing from there.\n33(b)-34. Having closed the anus and drawn up the Vayu and caused it to rise through (the repetition\nof) Pranava (Om), he should complete with Sri Bija. He should contemplate upon his Atman as Sri (or\nParasakti) and as being bathed by nectar.\n35. This is Kalavanchana (lit., time illusion). It is said to be the most important of all. Whatever is\nthought of by the mind is accomplished by the mind itself.\n36. (Then) Agni (fire) will flame in Jala (water) and in the flame (of Agni) will arise the branches and\nblossoms. Then the words uttered and the actions done regarding the universe, are not in vain.\n\n37. By checking the Bindu in the path, by making the fire flame up in the water and by causing the\nwater to dry up, the body is made firm.\n38. Having contracted simultaneously the anus and Yoni (the womb) united together, he should draw up\nApana and unite with it Samana.\n39. He should contemplate upon his Atman as Shiva and then as being bathed by nectar. In the central\npart of each spoke, the Yogin should commence to concentrate Bala (will or strength).\n40. He should try to go up by the union of Prana and Apana. This most important Yoga brightens up in\nthe body the path of Siddhis.\n41. As dam across the water serves as an obstacle to the floods, so it should ever be known by the\nYogins that the Chhaya of the body is to (Jiva).\n42. This Bandha is said of all Nadis. Through the grace of this Bandha, the Devata (goddess) becomes\nvisible.\n43. This Bandha of four feet serves as a check to the three paths. This brightens up the path through\nwhich the Siddhas obtained (their Siddhis).\n44. If with Prana is made to rise up soon Udana, this Bandha checking all Nadis goes up.\n45. This is called Samputa-Yoga or Mula-Bandha. Through the Practising of this Yoga, the three\nBandhas are mastered.\n46. By practising day and night intermittingly or at any convenient time, the Vayu will come under his\ncontrol.\n47. With the control of Vayu, Agni (the gastric fire) in the body will increase daily. With the increase of\nAgni, food, etc., will be easily digested.\n48. Should food be properly digested, there is increase of Rasa (essence of food). With the daily\nincrease of Rasa, there is the increase of Dhatus (spiritual substances).\n49. With the increase of Dhatus, there is the increase of wisdom in the body. Thus all the sins collected\ntogether during many Crores of births are burnt up.\n50. In the centre of the anus and the genitals, there is the triangular Muladhara. It illumines the seat of\nShiva of the form of Bindu.\n51. There is located the Parasakti named Kundalini. From that seat, Vayu arises. From that seat, Agni\nbecomes increased.\n52. From that seat, Bindu originates and Nada becomes increased. From that seat, Hamsa is born. From\nthat seat, Manas is born.\n53. The six Chakras beginning with Muladhara are said to be the seat of Sakti (Goddess). From the\nneck to the top of the head is said to be the seat of Sambhu (Shiva).\n54. To the Nadis, the body is the support (or vehicle); to Prana, the Nadis are the support; to Jiva, Prana\nis the dwelling place; to Hamsa, Jiva is the support;\n55. To Sakti, Hamsa is the seat and the locomotive and fixed universe. Being without distraction and of\na calm mind, one should practise Pranayama.\n56. Even a person who is well-skilled in the practice of the three Bandhas should try always to cognise\nwith a true heart that Principle which should be known and is the cause of all objects and their\nattributes.\n57. Both expiration and inspiration should (be stopped and made to) rest in restraint of breath (alone).\nHe should depend solely on Brahman which is the highest aim of all visibles.\n58. (The giving out of) all external objects is said to be Rechaka (expiration). The (taking in of the)\nspiritual knowledge of the Shastras is said to be Puraka (inspiration) and (the keeping to oneself of)\nsuch knowledge is said to be Kumbhaka (or restraint of breath).\n59. He is an emancipated person who practises thus such a Chitta. There is no doubt about it. Through\nKumbhaka, it (the mind) should be always taken up and through Kumbhaka alone it should be filled up\nwithin.\n60. It is only through Kumbhaka that Kumbhaka should be firmly mastered. Within it is Parama-Shiva.\n\nThat (Vayu) which is non-motionless should be shaken again through Kantha-Mudra (throat-posture).\n61-62. Having checked the course of Vayu, having become perfect in the practice of expiration and\nrestraint of breath and having planted evenly on the ground the two hands and the two feet, one should\npierce the four seats through Vayu through the three Yogas. He should shake Mahameru with the (aid\nof) Prakotis (forces) at the mouth of Vayu.\n63. The two Putas (cavities) being drawn, Vayu throbs quickly. The union of moon, sun and Agni\nshould be known on account of nectar.\n64. Through the motion of Meru, the Devatas who stay in the centre of Meru move. At first in his\nBrahma-Granthi, there is produced soon a hole (or passage).\n65. Then having pierced Brahma-Granthi, he pierces Vishnu-Granthi; then he pierces Rudra-Granthi.\n66-67(a). Then to the Yogin comes Vedha (piercing) through his liberation from the impurities of\ndelusion, through the religious ceremonies (performed) in various births, through the grace of Gurus\nand Devatas and through the practice of Yoga.\n67(b)-68. In the Mandala (sphere or region) of Susumna (situated between Ida and Pingala), Vayu\nshould be made to rise up through the feature known as Mudra-Bandha. The short pronunciation (of\nPranava) frees (one) from sins; its long pronunciation confers (on one) Moksha.\n69-70. So also its pronunciation in Apyayana or Pluta Svara (tone). He is a knower of Veda, who\nthrough the above-mentioned three ways of pronunciation knows the end of Pranava which is beyond\nthe power of speech, like the never ceasing flow of oil or the long-drawn bell-sound.The short Svara\ngoes to Bindu. The long Svara goes to Brahmarandhra; the Pluta to Dvadasanta (twelfth centre). The\nMantras should be uttered on account of getting Mantra Siddhis.\n71-72(a). This Pranava (OM) will remove all obstacles. It will remove all sins. Of this, are four\nBhumikas (states) predicated, viz., Arambha, Ghata, Parichaya and Nishpatti.\n72(b)-73(a). Arambha is that state in which one having abandoned external Karmas performed by the\nthree organs (mind, speech and body), is always engaged in mental Karma only.\n73(b)-74(a). It is said by the wise that the Ghata state is that in which Vayu having forced an opening\non the western side and being full, is firmly fixed there.\n74(b). Parichaya state is that in which Vayu is firmly fixed to Akasa, neither associated with Jiva nor\nnot, while the body is immovable.\n75. It is said that Nishpatti state is that in which there take place creation and dissolution through\nAtman or that state in which a Yogin having become a Jivanmukta performs Yoga without effort.\nWhoever recites this Upanishad becomes immaculate like Agni. Like Vayu, he becomes pure. He\nbecomes freed from the sin of drinking alcohol. He becomes freed from the sins of the theft of gold. He\nbecomes a Jivanmukta. This is what is said by the Rig-Veda. Like the eye pervading the Akasa (seeing\nwithout effort everything above), a wise man sees (always) the supreme seat of Vishnu. The Brahmanas\nwho have always their spiritual eyes wide open praise and illuminate in diverse ways the spiritual seat\nof Vishnu. OM, thus is the Upanishad.\u201d\nThus ends the fifth Chapter of Varaha Upanishad.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Varaha Upanishad belonging to the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Satyayani": "\nSatyayaniya Upanishad\nTranslated by Prof. A. A. Ramanathan\nPublished by The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. The mind alone is the cause of bondage and liberation of the people; (the mind) attached to the\nobjects of the senses leads them to bondage; freed from the objects it leads them to liberation. (Thus) it\nhas been declared.\n2. If that attachment of the mind of a person to the objects of the senses is directed towards Brahman,\nwho shall not be liberated from bondage ?\n3. The mind (chitta) alone is worldly life; hence it should be purified with effort. As the mind is, so he\nbecomes. This is the eternal secret.\n4. One who knows not the Veda realizes not that omnipresent One (Brahman); one who knows not\nBrahman reaches not that supreme abode. He who realizes that the omnipresent god (Vishnu), the\nomniscient one, the prop of all (Vasudeva) (is himself), that sage, seer of reality, attains the state of\nwisdom while living (vipratvam).\n5. Then (observing in the four disciplines) those Brahmanas well-versed in the Veda and untouched by\ndesires, who ponder over the eternal supreme Brahman (realize Brahman). (A person desiring\nliberation) who is quiescent, self-subdued, has renounced all sensory pleasures, is forbearing, well\nversed in the scripture, is known as equanimous, has discarded the primary desires (for wealth, wife\nand progeny) and is free from the debts (to the manes, etc.,), coming to realize the Atman, shall live,\nobserving silence, in some stage of life or other as the Kutichaka (or Paramahamsa).\n6. Then entering into the final stage of life (i.e. Sannyasa) he may possess five (small) things (matras)\nas is proper.\n\n7. He should possess as long as he lives (the five things, namely) a three-fold staff (of bamboo), sacred\nthread, garment consisting of a loin-cloth, sling and holy ring of sacred grass.\n8. These fire are the things pertaining to an ascetic (of the Kutichaka order); (to all ascetics the inward\npossessions are five, namely, the \u2018a\u2019, \u2018u\u2019, \u2018m\u2019, the bindu and the nada constituting Om.) This matra\n(namely the five constituents) is heard in the Pranava (Brahman). Till the final exit (of the vital breath)\nthe ascetic shall not abandon (the twofold five matras); even at death (the five external matras) shall be\nburied with him.\n9. The sign of Vishnu (i.e. means leading to liberation) is said to be twofold, the external and the\ninternal. If one of them is discarded (the ascetic) is without doubt fallen.\n10. The threefold staff is an emblem (leading to) Vishnu; it is a means of attaining liberation by learned\nBrahmanas as ascetics. It is the extinction of all worldly characteristics \u2013 thus runs the Vedic teaching.\n11-12. Then indeed, Oh Brahmana, there are four kinds of ascetics, namely Kutichaka, Bahudaka,\nHamsa and Paramahamsa. All these bear the signs of Vishnu (i.e. they strive for liberation), wear tuft\nand sacred thread, are pure in mind, consider their own Self as Brahman, are intent on worship (of\nGod) in the form of pure consciousness, practise muttering of prayers and the principal and secondary\ndisciplines (Yama and Niyama), are of good conduct and (thus) become exalted. This is declared in a\nVedic verse: The Kutichaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa and Paramahamsa ascetics are different in their way of\nlife; all these possess the signs of Vishnu, the external and internal, which are always visible and\ninvisible (respectively). Practising the five devotional acts (yajnas), having penetration into the\nVedanta, observing the rites (appropriate to the station in life), resorting to the spiritual lore,\nabandoning the tree (of worldly life) but having recourse to its root-cause (namely Brahman),\nrenouncing its flowers (of rituals) but enjoying its (true) essence, sporting in Vishnu (i.e. leading the\nlife spiritual), delighting in Vishnu, freed (from external worship), identifying themselves with Vishnu,\nthey realize the omnipresent Vishnu.\n13. Worship during the three junctures of the day (Sandhyas) bathing according to capacity, presenting\nlibations of water to the manes, cleansing (i.e. purifying oneself with water), waiting upon (the deities\nwith prayers) \u2013 these five devotional acts (the Kutichaka) shall perform till death.\n14. With ten Pranavas and seven mystic words (vyahritis) the four-footed Gayatri along with its \u2018head\u2019\nis the prayer to be recited during the three Sandhyas.\n15. The practice of yoga consists of the constant single-minded devoted service of Vishnu, the Guru;\nnon-injuring by word, thought and deed is the devotional act of penance (tapoyajna).\n16. It is declared that the devotional act of studying the scripture (Svadhyaya-yajna) consists of reciting\nthe various Upanishads. The attentive reciting of Om offers the (concept of the individual) Self in the\nfire of the (non-dual) Brahman.\n17. The devotional act of possessing spiritual wisdom (Jnana-yajna) is to be known as the very best of\nall yajnas. (The Paramahamsas) have Jnana (true knowledge) for the (emblematic) staff, Jnana for the\ntuft and Jnana for the sacred thread.\n18. He whose tuft consists of Jnana and the sacred thread too of that (Jnana) has all the characteristics\nof a Brahmana \u2013 thus is the injunction of the Veda.\n19. Then indeed, Oh Brahmana, these mendicant monks are as they appear (i.e. unclad, as when they\nwere born). They should desire to remain as a tree, having gone beyond passion, anger, greed, delusion,\nfalse pride, pride, envy, \u2018mine-ness\u2019 and egotism; and having discarded honour and dishonour, blame\nand praise; and when cut down (like a tree) they shall not complain. Thus these wise men become\nimmortal here (in this world) itself. This has been said in the Vedic verse: Having taken leave of his\nkinsmen and son with good will and not seeing them again, enduring the pairs (of opposites, heat and\ncold, etc.,) and quiescent he shall turn eastward or northward and proceed on foot.\n20-22. (Equipped with) a (water) vessel and staff, seeing four cubits of ground alone before him,\nwearing sacred thread and tuft or remaining shaven-headed, having a family (of his body alone), and\nreceiving from people alms unbegged or begged for bare sustenance\u2019 having a vessel made of clay,\n\nwood, gourd or strung leaves as originally provided, and clothed with a garment of hemp, silk, grass, a\npatched one, (deer-)skin or a leafy one strung or unstrung; shaving his head alone at the junction of the\nseasons without removing hair below and in the arm pits and never the tuft; he shall reside in a fixed\nplace for four months (of the rainy season) during which the inward soul, the omnipresent Purusha\n(Vishnu) is asleep (in the milky ocean).\n23. When (God, Vishnu) has risen (from sleep), the ascetic may reside in one place to carry out his\nwork (such as study, meditation or Samadhi) for the other eight months or he may go about (as a\nmendicant monk). (During the journey) he may stay (for short periods) in a temple, a hut where the\nritual fire is kept, the shade of a tree, or a cave, without attachment and unnoticed by the people. He\nshall be quiescent like fire when fuel is exhausted and he shall not give or cause trouble to any one\nanywhere. (On seeing one equal to or inferior to him he shall not shrink nor consider any one existing\nas different from himself).\n24. If a person has realized that he is the Atman non-different from the universal Self, what can he wish\nfor, and to fulfil which desire need he torture his body (by various kinds of austerities) ?\n25. A wise-man knowing this (truth) and thus a knower of Brahman shall have this consciousness. He\nshall not worry himself with many words; for it is only torturing language.\n26. Having discerned the knowledge of Brahman he should wish to remain with dispassion (lit. with the\ninnocence of the child); a sage has realized the Atman when he has the lore of Brahman and dispassion.\n27. When all desires which cling to the heart have been shed, then the man becomes immortal and he\nenjoys the (bliss of) Brahman here (itself).\n28. Then indeed, Oh Brahman, he who abandons this asceticism which is the highest spiritual life,\nbecomes a child-murderer, a murderer of a Brahmana, a killer of an embryo, a great sinner. He, who\nabandons this steady life pertaining to Vishnu (i.e. the external and internal discipline in spiritual life),\nbecomes a thief, a seducer of his preceptor\u2019s wife, treacherous to a friend, ungrateful; he is denied all\n(auspicious) worlds. This has been declared in the Vedic verse \u2013 A thief, a drinker of spirituous liquor, a\nseducer of his preceptor\u2019s wife and one treacherous to his friend get purified by expiation; (but) one\nwho abandons the sign of Vishnu, external or internal, which he was possessing, will never be purified\nin spite of all his self-exertions.\n29. Abandoning the sign of Vishnu-worship, external or internal, he who resorts to his stage of life or\nno (prescribed) stage at all, or returns (to his former way of living prior to renunciation) \u2013 to that great\nfool (and to people of his kind) there is no liberation seen even in tens of millions of eons.\n30. Abandoning all other stages of life a wise man should live for long in the stage of life leading to\nliberation. There is no liberation possible to one who has fallen from the stage leading to final\nbeatitude.\n31. Having embraced asceticism, if one does not remain observing its laws, he is to be known as \u2018fallen\nfrom grace\u2019 (arudhachyuta) \u2013 such is the Vedic injunction.\n32. Then indeed, Oh Brahmana, when (a wise man) has embraced this age old spiritual life pertaining\nto Vishnu and remains without transgressing it, he becomes self-controlled, worthy of being\nremembered as auspicious, a (true) knower of the world, a knower of the Vedanta, a knower of\nBrahman, omniscient, self-luminous; he becomes the supreme God Brahman, he redeems from (the\nmisery of) worldly life his ancestors, relations by marriage, (other) kinsmen, associates and friends.\n33. When a wise man renounces the world, those belonging to his family become blessed in this world,\na hundred generations before him and three hundred generations after him.\n34. The scripture says that a very pious mendicant monk redeems thirty generations of his family after\nhim, thirty generations before him and thirty generations after those that follow (the first thirty).\n35. The Vedic teaching is that the ancestors of (a wise man) are redeemed if he were to say that he has\nrenounced even while his final breath remains in his throat (i.e. just before death).\n36. Hence, Oh Brahmana, wise men have said that this age old lore of the Self, the discipline pertaining\nto Vishnu, shall not be expounded till one has oneself realized (the goal) and (that) not to one who has\n\nnot studied the Veda, has not the conviction of the Self, has not freed himself from attachment, has not\nbecome pure, has not approached (to receive this of his own accord), and who has not made earnest\nefforts (to know them). This has been said in a Vedic verse (as well):\nOnce (Brahma-)Vidya approached (the god) Brahma and said: \u2018Guard me, I am your treasure. Do not\nreveal me to one who is envious, crooked or crafty. Thus shall I be of potent strength\u2019.\n37. This discipline of the Atman pertaining to Vishnu (i.e. this lore to realize Brahman) shall be\nrevealed to a person after a careful test as to whether he is of pure conduct, attentive, intelligent,\nobserves celibacy and has approached (the Guru of his own accord for receiving instruction).\n38. With those ascetics who have been taught (the scripture) by a Guru and who do not honour him in\nword, thought and deed, the Guru does not dine; similarly (good ascetics) do not eat the food (from\nhouses where the ill-mannered receive alms). Such is the (injunction of the) scripture.\n39. The Guru is the supreme righteousness (Dharma); the Guru alone is the sole means (of liberation).\nHe who honours not his Guru who gives (initiation into) the single syllable (Om which is Brahman) has\nall his scriptural learning, penance and spiritual wisdom oozed out as water from an unbaked clay\nvessel.\n40. He who has supreme faith in God and the same faith in his Guru is a knower of Brahman, who\nreaches supreme beatitude. Such is the teaching of the Veda. Thus (ends) the Upanishad.\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Satyayaniyopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda.",
    "Hayagriva": "\nHayagriva Upanishad\nTranslated by P. R. Ramachander\nPublished by celextel.org\nOm ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;\nMay we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !\nMay we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,\nPraising them with our body and limbs steady !\nMay the glorious Indra bless us !\nMay the all-knowing Sun bless us !\nMay Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !\nMay Brihaspati grant us well-being !\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nFirst Chapter\nHari Om. Narada approached Lord Brahma and requested him, \u201cOh, God please teach me that\nknowledge of Brahman by which all sins can be destroyed quickly and the wisdom of Brahman is\nrealized and one is blessed with all the wealth.\u201d Lord Brahma told as follows:\nThe one who masters the mantras for which Lord Hayagreeva is the master would know Sruthi (heard\nknowledge), Smrithi (memorized knowledge), Ithihasas (history) and Puranas (epics) and would be\nblessed with all types of wealth. Those Mantras are as follows: 1.1\nHey, Lord Hayagreeva, who is the form of the holy mind, who saves everybody and who is the King of\nKnowledge, Salutations to you, Swaha, Swaha. 1.2\nHey , Lord Hayagreeva, who has the form of Rig, Yajur and Sama Vedas, who brought these Vedas to\nearth, who has the shape of the singing of Pranava, and who has a horse head, Salutations to you,\n\nSwaha, Swaha. 1.3\nHey Lord Hayagreeva, who is being sung by the song of Pranava, who is the God for all those Gods of\nwords, who is the personification of all Vedas, and who is beyond thought, teach us everything .\nSalutations to you, Swaha, Swaha. 1.4\nFor the 29 lettered mantra of Hayagreeva, Brahma, Athri ,Surya and Bhargava are the sages, Gayathri,\nTrushtup and Anushtup are the meters, God is Hayagreeva himself, root is the sound \u201cLhowm\n(hsowm), Strength (Shakthi) is Hoham, Keelaga (the nail) is Lhoom (Shoom), Viniyoga is Bhoga,\nMoksha and the symbolic rite with hands is the letters Aa, Uu and Ma.\nThe prayer is:\nI meditate on that Hayagreeva,\nWho has the glitter of the full moon,\nWho holds the conch, wheel, the great stamp and the book in his hands.\nThe 29 lettered Hayagreeva mantra is:\nOm Sreem, lhowm (Hsowm), Om Namo Bhagawathe, Hayagreevaya, Vishnave, Mahyam, Medham,\nPragnam, Prayascha Swaha! 1.5\nThe 28 lettered Hayagreeva mantra is:\nOm, Sreem, Im, Im, Im , Kleem, Kleem, Sow, Sow, Hreem, Om Namo Bhagawathe, Mahyam,\nMedham Pragnam, Prayascha Swaha! 1.6\nSecond Chapter\nI will now tell you that \u2018Hayagreeva knowledge\u2019 of Brahman which is of one letter. That is the root\nletter Lhoum (hsoum). Among all the roots, this Hayagreeva single letter root is the king of mantras.\n2.1\nChanting of the mantra \u201cLhoum (hsoum) Amrutham Kuru Swaha!\u201d, gives one the mastery over words,\nwealth and the eight occult powers. 2.2\nThe mantra \u201cLhoum (hsoum) Sakala Samrajya Sidhim Kuru Kuru Swaha\u201d tells us the secret of the\ngreat Vedic sayings like \u201cPragnanam Anandam Brahma (Brahmam is the realized happiness)\u201d, \u201cTat\nTvam Asi (You are it)\u201d, \u201cAyam Atma Brahma (My soul is Brahma)\u201d and \u201cAham Brahmasmi (I am\nBrahmam)\u201d. The same letter \u201cLhoum\u201d and \u201chsoum\u201d are the same vowels though different and give\nworldly pleasures and salvation respectively. 2.3\nAfter the chanting of Hayagreeva Mantra, it is normal to chant the Vedic mantras starting with\n1.Yad Vak Vadanthi\u2026. 2. Gowrimimaya\u2026 3 Oshtapidhana and 4. Sa Sarpareeramathim\u2026\u2026 2.4-2.7\nOne who reads this \u2018Hayagreeva knowledge\u2019 of Brahmam on the Ekadasi day, would become a great\nman because of the blessings of Hayagreeva. He would get salvation. Upanishad says, \"the knowledge\nof Brahmam which is taught with the mantra ending with 'Om Namo Brahmane\u2019 would never leave his\nheart\".\nOm !

At the end of Dvapara-Yuga, Narada went to Brahma and addressed him thus: \"O Lord, how\nshall I, roaming over the earth, be able to across Kali ?\" To which Brahma thus replied: \"Well asked.\nHearken to that which all Shrutis (the Vedas) keep secret and hidden, through which one may cross the\nSamsara (mundane existence) of Kali. He shakes off (the evil effects of) Kali through the mere uttering\nof the name of the Lord Narayana, who is the primeval Purusha\". Again Narada asked Brahma: \"What\nis the name ?\" To which Hiranyagarbha (Brahma) replied thus:\n1. Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare\nHare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare\n2. These sixteen names (words) are destructive of the evil effects of Kali.

    "Jabali": "\nJabali Upanishad\nTranslated by P. R. Ramachander\nPublished by celextel.org\nOm ! Let my limbs and speech, Prana, eyes, ears, vitality\nAnd all the senses grow in strength.\nAll existence is the Brahman of the Upanishads.\nMay I never deny Brahman, nor Brahman deny me.\nLet there be no denial at all:\nLet there be no denial at least from me.\nMay the virtues that are proclaimed in the Upanishads be in me,\nWho am devoted to the Atman; may they reside in me.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nThe Sage Pippalada approached Sage Jabali and asked him, \u201cOh God like sage, please teach me the\nsecret of the absolute philosophy. What is Thathwa (principle)? Who is Jeeva (being)? What is Pasu?\nWho is Ishwara? And what is the method for salvation?\u201d Thus asked sage Jabali explained to him\neverything as follows:\nJeeva (being) is nothing but God (the Lord of all beings - Pasupathi) himself who is acting the role of\negoism. That Jeeva (being) is the Pasu. Pasupathi is he who knows everything, who does the five jobs\nlike creation, and who is the Lord of all beings. Pasu (in common parlance) are those animals which eat\ngrass, which do not have viveka (knowledge to differentiate), which are driven by others, which are\nmade to work in jobs like agriculture and which undergo lot of sufferings. Similar to the owner of such\nanimals is the God Pasupathi who rules over all beings.\nTo the question, \u201cWhat trick is there to acquire such knowledge?\u201c. Jabali replied, \u201cBy wearing of the\nholy ash\". He further told, \u201cAfter taking the holy ash in hand by reciting the five Brahma mantras\nstarting with \u2018Sathyojatham\u2019, and chanting \u201cAgnirithi Basma (Hoy ash is fire)\u201d, mix it with water by\n\nchanting, \u201cManasthoke\u201d and then wear the holy ash in head, forehead and shoulders in sets of three\nlines chanting the three mantras \u201ctrayayusham\u201d. Further wear these by chanting the three mantras\nstarting with \u201cTrayayusham\u201d and the mantra \u201cTryambakam\u201d is called Sambhava penance. Those with\nknowledge of Veda say that this has been told in all Vedas. For avoiding rebirth, the people with eternal\nwisdom, should adopt this.\nAmong the three lines, the first one is Garhapathya (the domestic fire), the letter Aa, the quality of\nRajas, earth, Jeevathma (soul of beings), the power of creation, Rigveda, time of dawn and its God is\nLord Brahma. The second line is Dakshinagni (Fire of the south), the letter Uu, the quality of Sathva,\natmosphere, the soul inside the body, the power of desire, Yajurveda, the time of noon, and its God is\nLord Vishnu. The third line is the Ahavaneeya agni (the fire of the Sun), the letter Ma, the quality of\nThamas, the place of Gods, the Paramatma, the power of knowledge, Samaveda, the time of dusk and\nits God is Shiva. That individual, who wears holy ash, whether he is a Brahmachari or Sanyasi, gets rid\nof great as well as minor sins. He becomes fit to worship all gods; he becomes one who has taken bath\nin all holy waters and the one who has chanted all the Rudra mantras. He does not have rebirth. This\nUpanishad tells that, it is sworn that he will not have rebirth.\nOm !

Of the first verse, the seer is Sri. Of the (next) fourteen verses, the seers are Ananda etc. Of\nthe first three verses, \u2018hiranyavarnam\u2019, etc., the metre is Anustubh.

Else restrain the breath\nAnd stray not from the path of practice.\nII-3: Filling the mouth with breath, and in Fire\u2019s seat\nDrawing the down-breath, there arresting,\nWith fingers six of hands, from thumbs commencing\nStopping the ears, eyes and nostrils, too,\nYogins behold along this way\nThe inner light; their minds wrapt in the course\nOf varied musings on the sacred Om.\nII-4: Ears, mouth, eyes and nostrils must, perforce,\nBe by yoga stopped;\nClear and flawless then is heard the note\nIn cleansed Susumna\u2019s channel.\nII-5: In Anahata, then,\nResonant with strange notes, a sound is heard.\nSacred becomes the yogin\u2019s body; thus\nWith splendour filled and odour heavenly\nHe is ill no longer;\nII-6: His heart is filled;\nWhen heart-space resounds, a Yogin he\nBecomes; snapping the second knot, flows\nAt once the breath to middle region.\nII-7: Poised in lotus seat and others, too,\nFirm established must the Yogin be.\nThe knot of Vishnu, then rent asunder\nDelight wells up supreme.\nII-8: Beyond Anahata, \u2018the unstruck note\u2019,\nRises the drum\u2019s resounding sound;\nWith energy, piercing Rudra\u2019s knot\nThe maddala\u2019s note is heard.\nII-9: The vital breath moves on to Largest Space,\nThe sure abode of all perfections; thence,\nIgnoring mind\u2019s delight, the breath pervades\nAll yogic seats.\nII-10: Yoga achieved, the all-pervading sound\n\nTinkles and hence is \u2018the tinkler\u2019 styled.\nThen, integrated, the mind is adored\nOf sages like Sanaka and the rest.\nII-11: Identifying the finite with the infinite,\nThe fragments with the Whole, one meditates\nOn the vast Source; thus fulfilment found\nOne immortal becomes.\nII-12: Through unity with Self, prevent contact\nWith others; so too, through Self\u2019s being\nOppose ought else\u2019s self; thus, becoming\nTruth supreme, of all dualities free,\nSupreme is one for ever.\nII-13: Renounce the sense of I; yea,\nOf this world, of appearance so unlike.\nNever again is sorrow for the sage,\nRooted in Truth transcendent.\nII-14: Like salt in water melted and fused,\nSo self and mind in oneness are blended.\nThat concentration is styled.\nII-15: Breath dwindles and mind dissolves\nAnd Bliss homogeneous is found.\nThis is concentration.\nII-16: Fusion of lower and higher selves\nFree from all imaginings,\nIs styled concentration.\nII-17: Rid of the light of wakefulness,\nAnd of the mind that dreams;\nRid of sleep that knows none other,\nFree of all that causes pain;\nTotal void without reflections \u2013\nSuch is concentration.\nII-18: Through ceaseless concentrated sight\nWhen thought of body there is nought;\nThen unstirring Self is realized \u2013\nThis, concentration is called.\nII-19: Whithersoever the mind wanders\nThere, just there, is the prime abode;\nThere, just there, is supreme Brahman\nThat abides alike everywhere.\nIII-1: Next, the gods said to Him: Teach us how to discern the nine wheels. \u2018Be it similarly\u2019, said He:\nAt the base is the wheel of Brahman shaped like a threefold circle of waves. In that root is a power.\nOne should meditate on it in the form of fire. Just there is the seat in the form of desires; it yields the\nobjects of all desires. Such is the basic wheel.\nIII-2: The second is the wheel of Svadhisthana; it has six petals. In the centre of it is a west-faced\nphallus. One should meditate on it as resembling a sprout of coral. Right there is the \u2018seat of the girdle\u2019,\nyielding the power to attract the world.\nIII-3: The third is the wheel of the navel, a wide whirlpool with a form crooked like a serpent\u2019s.\nMeditate in its centre on the \u2018serpent power\u2019, effulgent like a crore of rising suns and resembling\n\nlightning. It has the power of competence and yields all perfections. It is the wheel (called)\nManipuraka.\nIII-4: The wheel of the heart has eight petals and it faces below. In its centre, on the phallus of light,\none should meditate. The symbol (of the divine Power), here, is the swan. She is beloved of all and\nenchants all the worlds.\nIII-5: The wheel of the throat (extends over) the breadth of four fingers. There on the left is Ida, the\nmoon-nerve; on the right is Pingala, the sun-nerve. In its centre, on Susumna of fair colour, one should\nmeditate. Who knows thus becomes the donor of the perfection of Anahata (\u2018the unstruck note\u2019).\nIII-6: The wheel of the palate: There flows the immortal elixir; the image of the tiny bell is in the\norifice whence is suspended \u2018the royal tooth\u2019 (the uvula) the tenth opening.

There, on the eye of\nknowledge, shaped like a tongue of flame, one should meditate. That is the root of the skull, the wheel\nof Ajna, the giver of power over words.\nIII-8: The Brahman-orifice is the wheel of nirvana. There should one meditate on the opening shaped\nlike a thread of smoke, thinner than a needle. There is the seat of meshes, the yielder of release.\nTherefore, it is the wheel of supreme Brahman.\nIII-9: The ninth is the wheel of space. There is the lotus with sixteen petals, facing upwards. Its pericarp\nin the middle is shaped like the '\u2018riple peaks'\u2019(the centre of the eyebrows). In its centre one should\nmeditate on the upgoing power, the supreme void. There indeed is the seat of the \u2018full mount\u2019, the\ninstrument of fulfilment of all desires.\nIII-10: Whoso constantly studies this Upanishad is purified by fire and by air; he comes in possession\nof all wealth, grains, good sons, wife, horses, lands, elephants, animals, she-buffaloes, female\nattendants, yoga, and knowledge. No more does he return. Such is the mystic doctrine.\nOm !

Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\n1. The sages, verily, with due reverence, asked the holy Asvalayana: How is that knowledge won which\nillumines the content of the word Tat ? Tell us that, Holy Sir, by meditation on which you know the\nTruth.\n2. Best of Sages ! I won supreme perfection by exalting Sarasvati with the reciting of the ten verses on\nHer, as also the Ric stanzas with the \u2018seed-syllables\u2019.\n3. The sages said: How, by what meditation, Sage of Dedicated Life, is the truth of Sarasvati won ?\nWhat pleases the great and sacred goddess Sarasvati ? Speak.\n4. Asvalayana then spoke: Of this great mantra of the ten verse on Sarasvati, I, Asvalayana, am the seer.\nThe eight-syllabled Anustubh is the metre; the holy Vagisvari, the divinity; \u2018yadvak\u2019 is the seed; \u2018devim\nvacham\u2019 the power; \u2018pra no devi\u2019 the lynch-pin; the application (of the mantra) is for pleasing Her; the\nconsecration of limbs is by (invoking) faith, intelligence, wisdom, memory, the goddess of speech and\nMahasarasvati.\n5. To win plenitude of speech, in my heart I salute the goddess Sarasvati, who shines like snow, pearls,\ncamphor and the moon; who confers auspicious blessing; is decked with garlands of golden Champaka\nblossoms; and charms the mind by her figure with the lofty, rounded bosom.\n6. Of this mantra (pra no devi), Bharadvaja is the seer; Gayatri, the metre; Sri Sarasvati, the divinity;\nOM, the seed, power and lynch-pin; its application is for gaining whatever is desired; consecration is\nwith the mantra.\n7. Her nature the essence of Vedanta\u2019s sense,\n\nShe the Supreme Sovereign,\nManifest as name and form \u2013\nMay Sarasvati guard me !\n8. OM !\nMay the goddess Sarasvati,\nDispenser of nourishment,\nGuardian of thoughts,\nProtect us ever !\n9. Of this mantra (a no divah), Atri is the seer; Tristubh, the metre; Sarasvati, the divinity; HRIM, the\nseed, power and lynch-pin; its application is for gaining whatever is desired; its application is for\ngaining whatever is desired; consecration of limbs is with the mantra.\n10. The only one extolled in Vedas four\nAnd their ancillaries; the non-dual\nPotency of Brahman \u2013 May She, divine\nSarasvati, protect me !\n11. HRIM\nFrom heaven, from the giant clouds,\nLet holy Sarasvati come\nTo our sacrifice; listening\nKindly to the call, may the Queen\nOf Waters gladly hear our sweet words !\n12. Of this mantra (pavaka nah), Madhucchandas is the seer; Gayatri, is the metre; Sarasvati, the\ndivinity; SRIM, the seed, power and lynch-pin; its application is for gaining whatever is desired;\nconsecration is with the mantra.\n13. Existing solely in the form of sense,\nOf sentence, word and letter,\nWithout beginning and without end \u2013\nMay She, infinite Sarasvati, protect me !\n14. SRIM\nThe purifier Sarasvati,\nDispenser of nourishment,\nTreasure of intelligence \u2013\nMay She accept our sacrifice !\n15. Of this mantra (chodayitri), Madhucchandas is the seer; Gayatri, the metre; Sarasvati, the divinity;\nBLUM, the seed, power and lynch-pin; consecration is with the mantra.\n16. In the self, among the gods,\nThe Sovereign Mistress of the gods\nDwells inwardly, forth uttering \u2013\nMay Sarasvati protect me !\n17. BLUM\nInspirer of truthful words,\nAwakener of noble minds,\nSarasvati receives worship.\n18. Of this mantra (maho arnah), Madhucchandas is the seer; Gayatri, the metre; Sarasvati, the divinity;\nSAUH, the seed, power and lynch-pin; consecration is with the mantra.\n19. She as the inner controller\nRules over all in the three worlds,\nDwells as Rudra, the Sun and others \u2013\nMay that Sarasvati protect me !\n\n20. SAUH\nSarasvati shines splendidly \u2013\nVast sheet of water \u2013 who confers\nWisdom and vivifies all thought.\n21. Of this mantra (chatvari vak), the seer is Uchathyaputra; Tristubh, the metre; Sarasvati, the divinity;\nAIM, the seed, power and lynch-pin; consecration is with the mantra.\n22. Being manifested, She is experienced\nBy sages looking inwardly;\nPervasive, one, form of awareness,\nMay Sarasvati protect me !\n23. AIM\nSpeech is confined to four groups of words.\nThese, intelligent Brahmans know.\nHidden in the cave, the three do not stir -The fourth group men speak forth.\n24. Of this mantra (yadvak), the seer is Bhargava; Tristubh, the metre; Sarasvati, the divinity; KLIM,\nthe seed, power and lynch-pin; consecration is with the mantra.\n25. Being conceived in eightfold form\nOf names, general and the like,\nShe as the integral is manifest \u2013\nMay She, Sarasvati, protect me !\n26. KLIM\nShe is the word of inert things;\nThe Queen of gods dwells silently;\nPower milks four energy-streams;\nWhither has fled Her supreme form ?\n27. Of this mantra (devim vacham), the seer is Bhargava; Tristubh, the metre; Sarasvati, the divinity;\nSAUH, the seed, power and lynch-pin; consecration is with the mantra.\n28. Whom the Vedas and all others\nOf distinct or indistinct speech\nSpeak forth \u2013 the cow that yields all desires,\nMay that Sarasvati protect me !\n29. SAUH\nThe gods, divine Speech engendered !\nHer, beasts of all forms speak;\nThe cow that yields sweet drink and vigour \u2013\nTo us may lauded Speech appear !\n30. Of this mantra (uta tvah), the seer is Brihaspati; Tristubh, the metre; Sarasvati, the divinity; SAM,\nthe seed, power and lynch-pin; consecration is with the mantra.\n31. Knowing whom all bonds are cut;\nAlong all paths the knower hies;\nTo that supreme abode \u2013 (Freedom) \u2013\nMay She, Sarasvati, protect me !\n32. SAM\nThough seeing, one does nor behold\nSpeech; though hearing one does not hear;\nTo one She does reveal Herself,\nAs does a well-robed wife in love\nUnto her lord.\n\n33. Of this mantra (ambitame), Gritsamada is the seer; Anustubh, the metre; Sarasvati, the divinity;\nAIM, the seed, power and lynch-pin; consecration is with the mantra.\n34. Vesting things of name and form\nIn Her, meditate they on Her,\nOf whom the form is the One Brahman,\nMay that Sarasvati protect me !\n35. AIM\nDearest mother ! Best of rivers !\nGreatest goddess ! Sarasvati !\nUnbelauded are we, almost \u2013\nMother ! Make for us great name !\n36. Female swan amidst the cluster\nOf the faces of the four-faced god \u2013\nMay the all-white Sarasvati\nSport for ever in my mind !\n37. Bowing to Thee, Sarada !\nDweller in Kashmir\u2019s city,\nThe I petition for ever \u2013\nGrant me the gift of right knowledge !\n38. Holding in Thy hands the string\nOf beads, the goad, the noose, the book,\nWearing the necklace of pearls,\nReside Thou ever in my speech !\n39. Thy neck is as the conch; thy lip\nDeep red; decked with all ornaments\nArt thou, goddess Sarasvati !\nGreat One ! reside on my tongue-tip !\n40. Faith, grasp, intelligence Thou art,\nGoddess of Speech, spouse of Brahma;\nThy home, the tongue-tip of devout\nSouls; Thou the giver of virtues,\nSuch as restraint of mind\u2019s movements.\n41. Obeisance to Thee, O Bhavani !\nWhose tresses deck the crescent moon.\nThou art the stream of nectar that\nExtinguishes samsara\u2019s heat.\n42. Whoso the gift of faultless poesy,\nAnd enjoyment and Freedom seeks,\nWith these ten verses, worshipping ever,\nBestows rich praise on Sarasvati,\n43. To him who thus unfailingly\nWorships and lauds Sarasvati,\nWho has both faith and devotion,\nConviction comes in six brief months.\n44. From him streams forth Sarasvati\nSpontaneous, lovely-lettered,\nIn sounds of poetry and prose\nOf import true and unmeasured.\n45. A text unheard the poet grasps;\n\nSarasvati\u2019s being he shares.\n46. Sarasvati thus spake:\nThrough Me even Brahma won\nSelf-knowledge eternal;\nEver being Truth, Knowledge, Bliss,\nMine is perpetual Brahmanhood,\nWithout let or hindrance.\n47. Thence through equilibrium\nOf qualities, Sattva,\nRajas, Tamas, become\nI Prakriti; in Me\nChit\u2019s semblance shines,\nAs reflection in mirror fair.\n48. Once more, Prakriti shines\nThreefoldwise, through that\nReflection of the Chit;\nAnd as determined by\nPrakriti, am I Purusha too verily.\n49. The Unborn, in Maya\nIn which pure Sattva reigns,\nIs reflected; Maya,\nPrakriti is, that has\nSattva dominant.\n50. That Maya is adjunct,\nWholly subordinate\nTo all-knowing Ishwara;\nFor, His alone oneness,\nOver Maya lordship, and\nOmniscience are, in truth.\n51. Being of Sattva made,\nIn essence collective,\nOf worlds the spectator,\nHe is God who holds power\nTo make, unmake or otherwise\nMake the universe; He\nHas virtues like all-knowingness.\n52. Maya has forces two; one projection,\nThe other, concealment: the first projects\nThe world \u2013 all that is subtle and all gross.\n53. The second veils, within, the gulf\nBetween the Seer and seen; without,\nThe gulf between creation and Brahman.\nMaya causes endless cosmic flux.\n54. Nescience appears in Witness-light,\nTo subtle body conjoined,\nSpirit and mind co-dwelling there\nBecome jiva phenomenal.\n55. His Jivahood,\nThrough ascription shines forth, also,\n\nIn Witness-light; together with\nThe fall of what conceals, and so,\nThe shining forth of distinction,\nThat (Jivahood) disappears, too.\n56. So also, through subservience\nOf Brahman to the Power which\nVeils Its difference from cosmos,\nBrahman shines forth in mutations.\n57. Here, too, the difference that holds\nBetween Brahman and the cosmos\nShows not, once Maya\u2019s power which\nConceals falls low; their difference\nIs in creation; in Brahman never.\n58. Five factors are there here; being,\nShining, loving, form, and name, too;\nThe first three to Brahman pertain;\nTwo others constitute the world.\n59. Leave aside the last two factors,\nBe intent on the former three;\nEither in the heart, or without,\nPractise always concentration.\n60-63. Twofold is concentration\nIn the human heart: with or without\nAspects; that with aspects is, then,\nTwofold, conforming to \u2018word\u2019\nAnd \u2018object\u2019; desire and its train\nAre objects of the mind; of them,\nAs spectator, meditate on\nConsciousness: that concentration\nConforms to objects. \u2018I without\nTaints am; being, knowing, loving\nI am; self-shining, devoid of\nDuality\u2019: to \u2018word\u2019 conforms.\nThus concentration with aspects.\nAbandoning \u2018objects\u2019 and \u2018words\u2019\nFor joy of deep Self-experience,\nOne wins concentration without\nAspects: a flame in windless spot.\n64. Like to concentration\nIn the heart, outside too, in some\nObject twofold concentration\nTakes place with discrimination\nOf name and form from pure Being.\n65. The third, as said above, takes place\nWhen taste of bliss to silence leads;\nTime may, without a break, be spent\nIn these six concentrations well.\n66. With conceit in body gone,\nAnd Supreme Self realized,\n\nWherever the mind may roam\nThere rests immortality.\nThe knot of heart is cut asunder\nAnd all doubts are slain;\n67. All modes of action dwindle away\nWhen the Supreme Self is seen.\n68. A finite soul, the supreme God \u2013\nThese notions are to Me imputed.\nThey are not real \u2013 who knows this,\nIn truth, is free \u2013 doubt is there none.\nThis is the secret wisdom.\nOm ! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;\nMay we work conjointly with great energy,\nMay our study be vigorous and effective;\nMay we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).\nOm !

Peace ! Peace ! Peace !\n1. Om. The Goddess was indeed one in the beginning. Alone she emitted the world-egg. (She) is known\nas Love\u2019s Part (IM). (She) is known as the half-syllabic instant after OM.\n2. Of Her was Brahma born; was Vishnu born; was Rudra born. All wind-gods were born, celestial\nminstrels, nymphs, semi-human beings playing on instruments, were born (of Her), all around. What is\nenjoyed was born; everything was born (of Her). Everything of Power was born (of Her). The eggborn, the sweat-born, the seed-born, the womb-born, whatever breathes here, the stationary as well as\nthe moving, and man were born (of Her).\n3. She, here, is the Power supreme. She, here, is the science of Sambhu, (known) either as the science\nbeginning with ka, or as the science beginning with ha, or as the science beginning with sa. This is the\nsecret Om grounded in the word Om.\n4. Pervading the three cities, the three bodies, illuminating within and without, She, the Consciousness\nwithin, becomes the Maha-Tripura-Sundari, being associated with space, time and objects.\n5. She alone is Atman. Other than Her is untruth, non-self. Hence is She Brahman-Consciousness, free\nfrom (even) a tinge of being and non-being. She is the Science of Consciousness, non-dual Brahman\nConsciousness, a wave of Being-Consciousness-Bliss. The Beauty of the three-great-cities, penetrating\nwithout and within, is resplendent, non-dual, self-subsisting. What is, is pure Being; what shines is pure\nConsciousness; what is dear is Bliss. So here is the Maha-Tripura-Sundari who assumes all forms. You\n\nand I and all the world and all divinities and all besides are the Maha-Tripura-Sundari. The sole Truth is\nthe thing named \u2018the Beautiful\u2019. It is the non-dual, integral, supreme Brahman.\n6. The fivefold form relinquished\nAnd effects like space transcended,\nRemains the one, the great being,\nThe supreme Ground, the only Truth.\n7. It is declared either that \u2018Brahman is Consciousness\u2019 or that \u2018I am Brahman\u2019. In dialogue it is said:\n\u2018Thou art That\u2019; or \u2018This Atman is Brahman\u2019; or \u2018I am Brahman\u2019; or \u2018Brahman alone am I\u2019.\n8. She who is contemplated as \u2018That which I am\u2019 or \u2018I am He\u2019 or \u2018What He is that I am\u2019, is the Sodasi,\nthe Science of Sri, the fifteen-syllabled (science), the sacred Maha-Tripura-Sundari, the Virgin, the\nMother, Bagala, the Matangi, the auspicious one who chooses her own Partner, the Mistress of the\nworld, Chamunda, Chanda, the Power of the Boar, She who veils, the royal Matangi, dark like a parrot,\nlight dark, mounted on a horse; opposed to Angiras; smoke-bannered; Power of Savitur, Sarasvati,\nGayatri, part of Brahmic bliss.\n9. The songs of praise dwell in the highest sphere\nWhere dwell all gods;\nWith Ric what will he do who knows not this ?\nThey who know this well, they dwell all right;\nThis is the secret science.\nOm !

In the beautiful city of Ayodhya, in the centre of a pavilion set with gems, together with Sita,\nBharata, Lakshmana and Satrughna, was Rama seated, glorified day and night by sages like Sanaka,\nVasistha and Suka as well as other devotees, unchanging witness of thousands of modifications of the\nintellect, delighted in contemplating his own form. At the end of this Samadhi, Hanuman asked with\ndevotion, \u2018O Rama, you are the supreme being, of the nature of Sat, Chid and Ananda. I desire to know\nyour nature truly for liberation. Please tell me how I can be released from bondage without strain.\nI-i-7-14. Rama: Well asked. I shall tell you. I am well established in Vedanta.\nHanuman: What is Vedanta and where is it ?\nRama: The Vedas in all their great extent are my breath, Vedanta is well grounded in them, like oil in\nsesamum.\nHanuman: How many are the Vedas and how many branches do they have ? Of these what are the\nUpanishads ?\nRama: Vedas are four, Rig-Veda etc., many branches and Upanishads exist in them. Rig-Veda has 21\nbranches and Yajus has 109. Sama has 1000 and Atharva has 50. Each branch has one Upanishad. Even\nby reading one verse of them with devotion, one gets the status of union with me, hard to get even by\nsages.\nI-i-15-17. Hanuman: Rama, sages speak differently: some say there is only one kind of liberation.\nOthers say it can be got by worshipping your name and by the Taraka mantra at Kashi. Others speak of\nSankhya-Yoga and Bhakti-Yoga, the enquiry into Vedanta-Vakyas etc.\n\nI-i-18-23. Rama: Liberation is of four kinds: Salokya etc. But the only real type is Kaivalya. Anybody\neven though leading a wicked life, attains Salokya, not other worlds, by worshipping my name. Dying\nin the sacred Brahmanala in Kashi, he will get the Taraka-mantra and also liberation, without rebirth.\nOn dying anywhere (else) in Kashi, Maheshvara will utter the Taraka-mantra in his right ear. He gets\nSarupya with me as his sins are washed away.\nThe same is called Salokya and Sarupya. Persevering in good conduct, with mind fixed upon me,\nloving me as the Self of all, the twice-born gets nearer to me \u2013 This is called the three forms of\nliberation. Salokya, Sarupya and Samipya.\nI-i-24-25. Meditating on my eternal form as prescribed by the Teacher, one will surely achieve identity\nwith me like the insects changing into the bee. This alone is the liberation of identity (Sayujya) yielding\nthe bliss of Brahman.\nAll these four kinds of Mukti will be got by worshipping Me.\nI-i-26-29. But by what means is the Kaivalya kind of Moksha got ? The Mandukya is enough; if\nknowledge is not got from it, then study the Ten Upanishads. Getting knowledge very soon, you will\nreach my abode. If certainty is not got even then, study the 32 Upanishads and stop. If desiring Moksha\nwithout the body, read the 108 Upanishads. Hear their order.\nI-i-30-39.\n1. Isa\n2. Kena\n3. Katha\n4.

The best of Brahmanas will become Jivanmuktas if they study upto the\ndestruction of Prarabdha, these 108 Upanishads from a Guru along with the Shanti-pada. Then, in\ncourse of time they will get Vedeha-mukti, surely.\nI-i-44-52. These 108 are the essence of all Upanishads and can cut away all sins by merely hearing\nonce. These cause release whether read with or without knowledge. One may give away a kingdom,\nwealth etc., to one who asks, but not these 108 to just anyone \u2013 to an unbeliever (nastika), ungrateful,\nof bad conduct, one against devotion to me, deluded by wrong scripture or lacking devotion to the\nGuru.\nBut they shall be taught to one devoted to service, devotee, of good conduct, birth and wisdom. He\nshould be well tested. A Rik verse on this: the goddess of knowledge came to a Brahmana and said\n\u2018Protect me, I am your treasure, do not teach me to one who is jealous, dishonest and deceitful \u2013 then I\nshall powerful, but give it to one who is learned, careful, wise and celibate, after examining him\u2019.\nI-ii-1.

Men who are seekers after Liberation and well-equipped with the four requisite means !\nApproach properly, with gifts in the hands, a good teacher who is dedicated, belonging to a good\nfamily, well-versed in the Vedas, interested in the scriptures, of good quality, straightforward, interested\nin the welfare of all creatures, compassionate and learn in the prescribed manner the one hundred and\neight Upanishads; study them through listening, reflection and deep absorption continuously; the\naccumulated Karmas will be dissolved, the three kinds of bodies (gross, subtle and causal) are\nabandoned and like the ether of the pot when released from its Upadhi, rise to the level of fullness\ncalled Videha-mukti. This indeed is the Absolute Liberation (Kaivalya-mukti). That is why even those\nin the Brahma-loka, get identity with Brahman after listening to the Upanishads from his mouth. And\nfor everyone Absolute Liberation is stated to be (attainable) only through knowledge; not through\nKarma rituals, not through Sankhya-Yoga or worship. Thus the Upanishad.\nII-i-1. Then Hanuman asked Ramachandra: What is this Jivanmukti, Videha-mukti ? What is the\nauthority, means of success and purpose ? Rama said: For a person there is bondage from doer-ship,\nenjoyer-ship, pleasure, pain etc., -- their prevention is liberation in the body. Videha-mukti (liberation\nwithout the body) is from the destruction of Prarabdha (operative) karma, like the space in a pot\nreleased from the conditioning (enclosing) pot. For both the authority is the 108 Upanishads. The\npurpose is eternal happiness through the stopping of the misery of doer-ship etc. This can be achieved\nby human effort just as a son is got by putra-kama sacrifice, wealth by trade etc., and heaven by\njyotistoma.\nII-ii-1-9. There are these verses: Human effort is said to be of the two kinds: For and against the\nShastras \u2013 the former gives disaster, the latter the ultimate reality. True knowledge does not come to\none from latent impressions through the world, Shastras and the body. Such impressions are two-fold:\ngood and bad; if you are induced by the good, you shall reach me gradually but quickly; the bad ones\ninvolved lead to trouble and should be overcome with effort. The river of impression flowing through\ngood and bad paths, must be turned into the good path with human effort \u2013 One should fondle the\nmind-child with human effort. When by means of practice, good impressions arise, then the practice\nhas been fruitful. Even when this is in doubt, practice only the good tendencies \u2013 there shall be no fault.\nII-ii-10-15. The destruction of impressions, cultivation of knowledge and destruction of the mind, when\npractised together for long will yield fruit. If not practised together, there will be no success even after\nhundreds of years, like mantras which are scattered. When these three are practised long, the knots of\nthe heart surely are broken, like lotus fibre and the stalk. The false impression of worldly life is got in a\n\nhundred lives and cannot be destroyed without long practice. So avoid desire of enjoyment as a\ndistance with effort and practise the three.\nII-ii-16. The wise know that the mind is bound by the impressions, it is liberated when released well\nfrom them. So, O Hanuman, practice the destruction of mental impression, quickly.\nII-ii-17-18. When impressions die out, the mind becomes put out like a lamp. Whoever gives up\nimpressions and concentrates on Me without strain, he becomes Bliss.\nII-ii-19-23. Whether he concentrates on actions or not, when he avoids all the desires of the heart, he is\ndoubtlessly liberated. He has nothing to gain from action or inaction. If his mind is not freed from\nimpressions even Samadhi and Japa cannot give fruit. The highest place cannot be got without silence\nfree from impressions. Sense organs like the eye go towards external objects without voluntary\nimpression but because of the latent impression just as the eye falls voluntarily without attachment on\nexternal objects, so the man of wisdom operates in work.\nII-ii-24-31. The sages know that Vasana comprises all objects generated by creative faculty of the mind\nin attaining or avoiding them. The very unsteady mind which is the cause of birth, old age and death is\ngenerated by desire for objects in excess. By the influence of Vasana there is the pulsation of Prana,\nfrom it comes Vasana (again) like seed and sprout. For the tree of the human mind, the pulsation and\nVasana are two seeds \u2013 when one dies both die. Latent impressions stop operating through detached\nbehaviour, avoidance of worldly thought and realization that the body is mortal.\nThe mind becomes non-mind by giving up Vasanas. When the mind does not think, then arises\nmindlessness giving great peace; so long as your mind has not fully evolved, being ignorant of the\nsupreme reality, perform what has been laid down by the teacher, Shastra and other sources. Then with\nimpurity ripened (and destroyed) and Truth understood, you should give up even the good impressions.\nII-ii-32-37. In a Jivanmukta the destruction of the mind is with form \u2013 in a Videhamukta it is formless \u2013\nwhen you achieve it, the mind with qualities like friendliness will surely attain peace. The mind of the\nJivanmukta has no rebirth.\nThe mind is the root of the tree of Samsara which has thousands of sprouts, branches, fruits etc. I take\nthe mind to be nothing but construction; make it dry in such a way that the tree also is dried up.\nII-ii-38-47. There is only one means for overpowering mind. Shooting up of one\u2019s mind is one\u2019s\nundoing, its destruction is good fortune. The mind of the knower is destroyed, it is a chain for the\nignorant. As long as the mind is not defeated by means of firm practice, the impressions jump in the\nheart like ghosts at night.\nThe impressions of enjoyment die, like lotus in winter, for one whose mental pride is reduced and the\nsenses \u2013 the enemies \u2013 are defeated. One should at first conquer the mind, hands locked in hands, teeth\nset on teeth and limbs subdued. The mind cannot be conquered without defectless reasoning (methods)\nby merely sitting, just as an elephant in rut without a goad. The reasons (methods) well-nourished in\nmind-conquest are knowledge of Vedanta, contact with good people, giving up impressions and\nstopping of the pulsation of Prana. Those who ignore these and control the mind by force, throw away\nthe lamp and search in darkness by means of soot, also (try to) bind an elephant in rut by lotus fibre.\nII-ii-48-50. The tree of mind, bearing the weight of the creepers of thought, has two seeds: the pulsation\nof Prana and strong impressions. All pervasive consciousness is shaken by the pulsation of Prana \u2013 In\ncontrast, by means of concentration the knowledge arises. The Dhyana, its means, is now imparted.\nDissolving thought totally in the reverse order, think only of the remaining pure consciousness.\nII-ii-51-56. After the Apana sets and before Prana arises in the heart, there exists the state of Kumbhaka\n(immobility) experienced by Yogins. Kumbhaka in the external form is the fullness of Prana after inbreath disappears and out-breath arises. By repeatedly practising meditation of Brahman without ego,\nSamprajnata Samadhi will be got. The Asamprajnata Samadhi, loved by Yogins, is (from) the mind\ngiving great bliss after (all) the mental modifications (thoughts) die away. It is valued by sages, being\nthe spirit devoid of the light (of ego), of the mind (of dream) and of the intellect (in deep sleep). This\nconcentration is other than what is not Brahman. Full above, below and in the middle the essence of\n\ngoodness \u2013 this state, prescribed by the Upanishads, is the ultimate reality.\nII-ii-57-60. Latent impression is that unexamined grasping of objects by persistent imagination. What\none brings into being, through intense dispassion by one\u2019s self, is realized quickly, devoid of opposite\nimpressions. Influenced by impressions, a person looks upon those things as reality by the peculiarity\nof the impressions, the ignorant person sees the spirit wrongly though it does not lose its own nature.\nII-ii-61-68. The impure impression binds, the pure destroys birth. The impure one is solid ignorance\nand ego, causes rebirth. The restful state is like the roasted seed, giving up the (sprout of) rebirth. Can\nthe inner light be sought with chewing the cud of many Shastras, uselessly ? One who remains alone\ngiving up perception as well as non-perception is himself the Brahman \u2013 A person cannot know\nBrahman by merely learning the four Vedas and Shastras, as the ladle cannot taste the food.\nIf a person does not get detachment by the bad smell of his own body, what other cause of detachment\ncan be taught ? The body is very impure \u2013 the soul is pure. When one knows the difference, what\npurification need be prescribed ? Bondage is by impressions, Moksha is their destruction \u2013 you give\nthem up as well as the desire for Moksha.\nII-ii-69-71. Give up mental impressions of objects and cultivate pure impressions like friendship; then,\ndiscarding even these while acting according to them, putting down all desires, have only the\nimpression of consciousness. Give up these too along with mind and intellect; concentrate only on me.\nII-ii-72-77. Contemplate me as devoid of sound, touch, form, taste and smell, eternal, indestructible,\nwithout name and family, destroying all suffering, the nature of vision like the sky, the one syllable\nOm, unsmearing though omnipresent, unique, without bondage, forward, across, above, below, I fill\never place.\nUnborn, ageless, shining by myself, not the cause nor effect, ever contented when the body dies away,\ngiving up the state of Jivanmukta, one enter the Videhamukti stage.\nSo says the Rik: That supreme place of Vishnu the sages see ever \u2013 like an eye extended in heaven. The\nwise and awakened persons, free from emotions, keep it alight.\nOm \u2013 This is the Upanishad.\nOm ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.\nThe infinite proceeds from the infinite.\n(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),\nIt remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\nOm ! Let there be Peace in me !\nLet there be Peace in my environment !\nLet there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\nHere ends the Muktikopanishad belonging to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda."
